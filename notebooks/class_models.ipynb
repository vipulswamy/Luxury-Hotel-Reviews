              "['i am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place i made my booking via booking com we stayed for   nights in this hotel from   to   july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the  nd floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the   level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining   times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day so i had to check out the next day before   o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till     in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room   i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell and it did not stop even at   am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife i have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail the next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only   room left the one that was smaller but seems newer only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful no negative no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to amsterdam rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps so ask for single level inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge location was good and staff were ok it is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice will go back my room was dirty and i was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage i also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests i understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after i complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when i was already in bed and ready to sleep great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area the building also has quite some character you when i booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room i thought i was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly which was completely false advertising after being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s  th birthday present please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again i didn t really know what i was paying for and how much it had wnded up being your photos told me i was getting something i wasn t not happy and won t be using you again amazing location and building romantic setting backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with   stars good restaurant with modern design great chill out place great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed they also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it the room is spacious and bright the hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park apart from the price for the brekfast everything very good good location set in a lovely park friendly staff food high quality we oth enjoyed the breakfast even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived also check in is at   o clock but our room was not ready at that timeno positive the aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night the room was big enough and the bed is good the breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening many people are having picnics and do some bicycling nothing all great rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building pictures are of room   the true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly also the bath was lovely and big and inviting great more for couples restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a   minute walk away and only about   or   stops from the centre of amsterdam would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too     am started big noise workers loading wood down the windows stupid room numbering system it took   minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms the check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction no late dinner bar closes at   am ugly view on trash lorry from windows no information about the computerized telephone huge price difference between booking com price   euros and hotel price   style location rooms the floor in my room was filfy dirty very basic rooms i had a  yr old tv in my room fridge did not work overpriced breakfast comfy bed good location no negative this hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location my spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park the breakfast selection was spectacular all considered this was a great hotel for the price and i plan to return the staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him it was very good very historic building that s why i chose it no negative this hotel is awesome i took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park arrive in the city are like   minutes by tram and is super easy the hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room i ll come back for sure there the staff very gentle one spanish man really really good very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children i asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one room decoration was minamilist which i like but felt prison cell sparse great onsite cafe amazing building park location amazing bobby gin and tonic we did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this the room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment we loved the location of this hotel the fact that it is set in a park away from the busy centre of dam square was great the tram system was brilliant and easy to handle the hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from ireland no negative public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt its an old building and clearly has old building issues we had issues with our electronic key everyday it deactivated it wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue the staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail the tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily and the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival that situation didn t change other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely i liked the hotels history and for such an enormous hotel i can t imagine how many girls were orphaned i liked their breakfast it was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs juices tea and coffee bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase no usb port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous some corridors were poorly lit friendly staff oostpark a few yards away good continental breakfast selection quiet and relaxing area our room was an overrated disaster room   dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then   euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery the breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet we did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional we had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location sadly i cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me when we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed we called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us we waited at least half an hour and no one showed up we had to go to the front desk and complain again when we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot we were however no interest to complain anymore also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which i had to ignore the whole time i didn t feel comfortable at all the staff at front desk are very friendly however i guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies first you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway what more annoying is that i got woke up at   in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms and they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour they kept open and close the door i was really annoyed i was in my holiday and i just wanted to have a good sleep at least the parking place was small but ok when we arrived the ticket machine was broken someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in we did so and paid for   days when we checked out when we drove out the ticket machine was broken again so we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still i was not so happy because i have the feeling that i paid for nothing the location is good you need  min to  min walk to the center depends on your speed the hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design the bed was really comfortable transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly nothing lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by  min walk or the tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a   mins walk to the hotel all in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning the bathroom in our room was a black glass box it theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall it did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv great location in the park near museums and restaurants perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right friendly and helpful staff i m nothing at all to do with the hotel of course but people tend to slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a slam to awake you other than that nothing to fault at all the hotel itself is in a lovely location a  min if that tram ride into the center train right outside the hotel easy access to everywhere the staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds bathroom was clean spacious and airy we had shampoo body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees it literally has everything you need in the room perfect hotel couldn t fault it at all the lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great tennis court outside the hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around careful they are still renovating the building and start at  am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you great hotel original concept style we had   different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans there was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom the hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits there is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel the hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced the bathroom is not very practical the hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features there is a big park just opposite to the hotel public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close good wifi all around the hotel little bit on the pricey side the staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning extensive restorations works going on we had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view temporary reception area the building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside when the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous no fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective friendly staff the bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park very modern our bathroom had an urine order shower was very slippery no shower chair handles or bars bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off very expensive and breakfast was not included construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it there was a park and that was nice not close to town or museums no positive please see above the hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect however the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible the rooms were cold although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming it could use some design help an area rug or two the room was very big spacious the bath tub was large enough for two people i love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains the park location was amazing construction on site but not mentioned on booking com the breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms they do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable the park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour also the bathtub and bed is great not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park the glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double it is necessary to darken the glasses much more very nice hotel located in a park ca   minutes by walk to the city center not typical for amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings but pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights but apart from that there is not really much i dislike about the hotel i suppose if there is one thing the room i had did not have a view only other rooms but i dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal i can find that i did not like plus stayed for   nights and this place was perfect for that the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam i would definitely like to stay here again i only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as a brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts i was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and i personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good i will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to amsterdam staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say i don t know the answer let me find out for you there didn t seem to be a manager around unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished the temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows this is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy the hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building the building itself has great history and wonderful architecture the staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love first room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes we requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than   minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading fault reported but not rectified during our stay the building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at     per head location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre staff very courteous hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although i prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino room was huge     meter high ceilings and freezing cold heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium and for all that i paid   never again love the design of the renovated product the park nearby for a walk water pressure in my shower was no existent feel bad even saying that staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in the cafe is very cool will be back the service was awful they refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning the brunch to purchase in the morning was good bathroom lighting could have been brighter the airconditioning of our room   could not be turned down lower than   degrees celcius the refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat the toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either the location of the hotel is super opening out to oosterpark the staff was very helpful and friendly the bed was very comfortable the room was spacious enough for   people the hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when i booked it or at any point until we arrived there we then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby the room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which i first discovered with my barefoot we woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete hardly the relaxing break from noisey london that i believed i had booked the pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris the first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell their   breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead we spent   in   days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends   minutes before this hotel even comes into view they will also take   deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay this meant on arrival i suddenly had to pay a further   which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction we made the best of it but i really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and i definitely would have stayed somewhere else massive bed the hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram the hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups the hotel looks really impressive set in a beautiful location the room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable i d ever slept in no negative the quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise the location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants i cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone service horrible pillows super stiff and big could break your neck room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened service in general was poor i would not stay here clean and new the bar was shut when i got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a saturday night in a city like amsterdam my room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building the room i was given was enormous and very comfortable i wish i had been staying for a week not just one night when arriving i was told i had to pay   city tax that wasn t shown on the policies i pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals the sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor when checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us we waited   minutes after   we asked how long it would be she said i will check she said that twice made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight wasn t happy at all the location and views i loved everything the location in a quiet park with a great terrace the space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste the gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable it s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in amsterdam staff was very friendly and accommodating the restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eatno negative beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepctionno negative the hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing they even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when i emailed them about this when i first booked online this was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town it is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too i would highly recommend there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at    pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until   mid night location in the park cool interior design comfy bed some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of amsterdam room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly the hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets personal preference the location was perfect and so beautiful only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really no negative basically everything the style of the hotel is really great the breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar the wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel the location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center i loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure the staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that thumbs up from me the place is completely mismanaged the property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice don t stay here if you are expecting a   star experience it s a   star location with   star service the restaurant service is the worst i have ever experienced the staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently the hotel has many strange design choices too had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet shower overflows all over bathroom quickly you can see into the urinals from the reception area loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs this is the only negative review i have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management the property is beautiful the bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again i d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday we got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful lovely room very comfy bed very bad attitude of personnel at breakfast only allowed one coffee from the coffee machine filter coffee was free rude behavior of the manager room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room location is good they gave me some freebies for noisy room the bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe the hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park the hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us just bad organisation on room allocation great trip staff very friendly asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip nice open room bed plenty of room bath room clean fridge was a nice touch easy to get in and out staff accommodated us fast and politely room was not cleaned correctly wine champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged from the day we arrived to begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after it has undergone some major renovations since i last stayed there the new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property super impressed with the park and the way nature comes together with the hotel new dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing the bathroom was amazing though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times they should think about a screen or opaque glass beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff quick tram to leidseplein and metro to central our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues i would recommend the hotel to anyone the bath and shower room was amazing beautiful hotel they are going through a refebishment at the moment and i am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which i think will look even more stunning then the building is already the breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized the young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests this was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out i would expect a better experience for that price the building was fantastic all renovated areas were very stylish the receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place breakfast i missed cutted fresh fruits for muesli couldn t find the cheese and for capuccino you had to pay extra the young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful dinner has been cooked excellent the sink in the bathroom was very dirty when i got the room unacceptable the room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive the location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added if you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel the glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty nearly all the guests we came across we re british but there was a complete lack of english breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast what made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast the hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast lovely hotel with lots of history great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bedno negative the whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly the dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well the room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again the hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking we had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction the location on the park is excellent and very peaceful the restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee rooms were a little louder than we would have liked a lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed no negative hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful i requested a split level room which they gave me when i arrived the room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy the hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the metro would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning no negative we have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms there are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special our room   was just gorgeous the hotel is being renovated which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at  am we paid eur  for a large room but really it was not worth the money the location is beautiful i m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel i can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete we didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel especially the hall to our room the cleaniness of the rooms can be better check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up and cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel we like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed the man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful the room was lovely great hotel beautiful location the hotel is currently being renovated being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above mini bar empty no remote for the tv heating direct above the bed and quite noisy the restaurant opened   days before however the food was good especially the burger good breakfast with fresh orange juice wifi in all hotel initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms staff a very helpful and chatty it s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer that i wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works we had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments when walking around there was nobody very empty feel the bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss the food was absolutely gorgeous maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping stained carpet not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from    m high not much useful information no minibar understaffed reception long wait pretty building interesting rooms no ground floor room as requested   months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par much better last time we stayed prices gone up room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences we booked   twins and were given   and a double which they couldn t change not happy plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain a lot more interesting and quirky even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably no remediation possible toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests some were empty some partially used checkout at      hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time having paid over   for   night stay this is somewhat disappointing service at breakfast was very poor shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done large bed the room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere it s a beautiful hotel or should i say will be when the renovation is finished in a terrible state with builders everywhere we had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair good location cheap so lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying one person in our group got  v electric chock which went through her hands it came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately the hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room they also let us have a late check out for free of charge thats all of the compensation we had in my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think the managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it the hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too it anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there location of the hotel is about  km from the nearest metro station the rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in however there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion there were construction works and such information was not passed to us when we booked there was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower too dark common reas beautifull buiding next to oosterpark friendly staff great breakfast the work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate great room very comfortable bed nice and quiet fantastic decor and amazing staircases the location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour the immediate area is fantastic great park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available near by brewery that do tours not heineken and great beer good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center no negative we upgraded to a larger room had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep i ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building however the design tried to maximise its quirky layout a very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding got charged   for a birthday package when it was advertised for   on the website this was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of the shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use we were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower couldn t check us into our room at  pm had to wait extra   minutes standard breakfast was very expensive at   i highly suggest not to buy cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend no positive split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical   tv remote for both tv s but on differernt floors a c is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust the walls are also very thin not good sound proofing beautiful surroundings great location old world style of the hotel is really different building work starting at  am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance also air conditioning very very loud location hotel is having some construction work done this i can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not   star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down i thought location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll there was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot the staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates the staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing so our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant the bed was amazing actually our whole room large room the park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location i love amsterdam building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle staff were brilliant really helpful attentive and friendly amazing building with lots of history too construction during the day though not intrusive great customer service staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and metro passes the front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined the rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly the breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from no limited a c in common areas dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters musty smell throughout common areas deluxe rooms very small impractical design impractical shower design no place for soap poor quality bed mattress room refrigerator barely worked food in restaurant overprices only fair quality overall dark rundown dreary appearance good water pressure in shower there was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place the hotel is located in a very nice area of amsterdam there are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city staff were very kind the hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious we upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful staff promised things they didn t deliver room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant generally clean and interestingly designed but a little worn meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process the reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots no negative architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels the arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space location is fab in the green space of oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the city halls the rooms are quirky with a small footprint the ground level has a closet small sofa wc and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level there s a tv on each level no negative breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night no negative this hotel was great value for money only a few tram stops away from the city centre it was close enough for all the attractions of amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood the zoo is literally a   minute walk away or one tram stop very accessible the room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep i ve ever had i would highly recommend this hotel we would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated we had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at     because of the noise booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel very friendly staff lovely comfy room i wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only   food recommendations were brilliant the outside of the hotel is under construction it will look beautiful when it s done the inside of the hotel is very classy he staff are friendly and helpful our room was great huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed the hotel is a nice area there is a big park next door and it is only a   minute walk to the heineken experience the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times the bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering the staff member who checked us in charged us a   security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to the hotel was warm and beautifully decorated we were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice the hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation the sidewalk entrance was a mess there was no mention of this at all on the booking com website we were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation not good enough the location of this hotel is great it s very close to the tram lines and subway the staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking the breakfast buffet was fine major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion room on   levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience after complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby staff very friendly willing to help the first room had steep steps to a loft bed not practical and dangerous for someone   especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night second night had a room on one level no positive the bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all the room size was also pretty small well located if you don t mind taking the train our suite on the   floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle the staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered for the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority it is starting to look frayed at the edges but there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good the location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam the shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster the room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges the bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare the stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids you definitely get what you pay for it was half clean and not very central liked the staff the location overpriced breakfast bed too soft bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on building works impact on overall good impression special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel relaxed atmosphere nice restaurant and bar area with terasse good accessibility of public transport we were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in   days we had to ask for more towels we ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after   mouthfuls my friend was sick room was a great size and comfy bed we did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains told reception but nothing was done about it it definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back the staff were lovely and very helpful bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links the bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to the lighting in the halls was too dim there was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent the snacks in the restaurant were also very good the staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful the bed was comfy we had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought we told reception but nothing came of it very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows we stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful two storey room with narrow winding stairs wet room d cor and functionality lack of storage space very helpful and friendly staff free wifi location and proximity to public transport provision of iron and board   televisions there was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom this means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night the hotel has its own character and a long history very cool vibe we got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside it would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor it was noisy from the main street it was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes there was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this i am sure it will be very nice when it is finished good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history first impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with also we were given a duplex suite to start with dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about the hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak english restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park foyer was a mess only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two we had a very cold spell and it was draughty the first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over   or afraid of hights the second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair the hotel states it is four star but is not it feels like a up graded backpackers it is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max i thought i was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was the hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking it was very disappointing and embarrassing as i had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms no positive the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken very poor the friendly staff in bar restaurant the evening meal was excellent a pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful after the building renovations i think this hotel will be fabulous it has so much history and is so unusual loved it the only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well the staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy there was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work great room great staff great food building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming gothic look of reception area checking out at    am wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way see through glass to shower food in restaurant quirky place use to be a hospital reasonably convienent for transport into city centre beautiful park beside hotel walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast we didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move roomsno negative beautiful gothic hotel very good location some nice bars and restaurants fabulous thai restaurant   minutes away   metro stops from dam centre really enjoyed staying there there was building work ongoing but you would never have know the fact i had to leave the whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful the d cor but hotel is currently being extended i expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished room was lovely we got a free upgrade bathroom fab excellent breakfast nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice the interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking this hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay currently have building work in the complex this didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive very comfortable bed and cool hotel stairs in our room were too narrow and steep no where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road hotel was very clean and staff helpful very trendy and reasonably priced we booked a   night stay in a suite on arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places during the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at   i went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened it turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room he came to apologise with a feeble excuse i tripped and fell into the door we didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us i asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was we went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with no it wasn t i came home to find my credit card had been charged   from them i phoned them up to complain and the money was returned however i have lost about   in bank charges due to their incompetence terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel no positive the noise of the construction works that began at  am sharp in the mornings the see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper the bed was huge and comfortable massively high ceilings and the feature staircase the hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on mon morning staff were very friendly helpful the kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive there were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside however in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that i can only put down to the work outside it was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely considering it was a   star the room could have been abit neater ie the corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major the style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom our kingsize was very comfy and spacious the hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings all of the staff spoke english perfectly just like most people in the city and i couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places hotel arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a   minute walk from a tram stop to centraal dam square rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring it s also right next to oosterpark so i can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in amsterdam as it was mine more sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down no mention of the building work going on location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but i m sure it will look amazing really funky room when we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste the bed was super cosy the staff was nice the hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle room   should be discontinued it is really too small and only upsets your customers breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others you could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel got off to a bad start room   was tiny and they changed us no argument bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel and great shower no negative bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre also th bathroom walls are completely see through wouldn t advise number   s if you are sharing a room the cleanness was quite poor a lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night the staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice the bed was quite confortable being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink i d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening if you are going to compensate do it properly average good accommodation big room helpful staff room cleaned daily big hot shower comfy bed the first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom i raised this with the staff and was given another room however we where there   days and the housekeeping is shocking they do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets they just come make ur bed that s all same cups same rubbish it s disgusting please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy do not book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where i could see the toilet from the bed other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid the only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks considering they have work going on location is great  mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in  mins also we bought   day travel ticket from the train station for   euros n the hotel sell this for     euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam only to and from airport i hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together that may just be a european thing or maybe i got the reservation wrong either way i would still go back to this hotel the place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle the hotel was in a bad condition not really clean and everything was worn out breakfast was barely ok and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when i got it hotel arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise bed was nice rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained really nice building but lots of building work going off but only outside so not a problem good size rooms fairly modern good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram wifi worked perfectly and quickly the hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly the room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which i thought was poor no bath in room even though i requested one on booking   reception changed rooms immediately after complaint radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem the staff were very friendly and helpful rooms s good size nice bathrooms bar area very comfortable complimentary drink a nice touch a little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around plans for development look amazing would like come back when completed location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through the room was exactly as expected the bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was huge easy check in and check out only a   minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a    min walk the hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive great hotel and quiet university area wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms the food is wonderful the shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back the room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works but very good value for money the bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay very happy with our room for the money that we paid no negative the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive the room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning i would recommend this hotel to anyone nothing one of the receptionist she did a racist comment regarding my accent and my country the housekeeping didnt like was a disaster enter in the room without knock the door a tall girl no positive breakfast was crazy expensive location required about a   minute walk to the nearest subway construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows very memorable the hotel is right next to a large nice park staff was friendly the location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough the hotel looked out of place there when upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra   one of the pillows was filthy a call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour but still not what you would expect room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu the rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere due to building work in progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all   of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked   separate rooms for a reason we booked   double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in   twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the   pound that was spent no positive the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over   days must of been greeted and welcomed by   different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking the decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredibleno negative the hotel is amazing beautiful interior we weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof our room was fantastic the only thing i should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below  oc the room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush the bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards room service good quality staff we didn t have a bad experience we loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue hotel was very modern and location was great complimentary drinks was a really nice touch no negative stayed in this hotel for   nights with my boyfriend the hotel was perfect a short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy we really enjoyed our stay breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish they charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means unfortunately they charged   of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location when i arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before i booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done all the lovely garden had been tourn up then the next morning i got rudely awakened at         by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so that s probably why i wouldn t stay at hotel arena again i was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full english breakfasts the bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy it was nice the shower was clean i enjoyed my room wasn t allowed to check in till   but managed to get us a room by  ish which was good finding no car park when i had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying there was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way the staff were a bit abrupt not really listening i asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening i called reception they said one coming very soon i had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told some time later i had said i wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten i took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before the answer was no but we could have a fan i said no because i did not want to risk waiting the room was pleasant we liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable the mini fridge safe tv s with english channels and the ability to make drink were pluses the shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light a lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction the location unfortunately were a bit far from the center   min by tramp the room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best i ve ever seen the staff is very kind i would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel   min to the center the fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed woken by builders two mornings at  am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion the room we upgraded to was very nice breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a gym swimming pool location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again the hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside during working hours the noise can be very disturbing the facilities look and sound rickety the a c is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold what s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls chinese water torture anyone the bathroom walls are transparent and i don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint i mean oh my word i didn t want to see that there is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom the staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them   days in a row with no new towels the hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it if you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead or another hotel polite staff the bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar i thought this was a nice gesture until i was repeatedly told i can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or  cl beer you might have well not bothered hotel arena it was more like an insult the staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful the rooms were clean stylish and comfortable the hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of amsterdam the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at  am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when i reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working i stayed there   days never again nothing in our own experience first night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the ac the next day we were moved to a better room ok but i was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t ac was very noisy also in the new room and last at reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost  euro after doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us   euro the driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from arena staff was vey pleasant the place is very well designed arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated on the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level the space of the lower level is very small   of it is bathroom no cafes and supermarkets in the nearby no minibar in room only at reception arena is hardly a   star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a   hotel only location is good it takes   mins by feet and     mins by tram to get to the city center reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful the room was stunning did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door will definitely recommend cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost   euros driver charged us   euros but only payed   euros from the airport to the hotel very smart room good food no plug with washbasin staff did not think this was a problem though i did had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine breakfast staff the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked the toilet has glass walls no privacy the room was dirty after   days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small i don t understand how this hotel has   stars the day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at     because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel the hall partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction no negative staff were really friendly  hour front desk beautiful hotel the room i stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food and easy trams into central   mins i highly recommend room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived we found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned in addition the daily cleaning was very basic unacceptable for an hotel of this category such a pity because everything else was great my advice to the management is more attention to details having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board not conductive to maintain grow the business listen to your customers please very beautiful building cozy room cool bar no negative staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train breakfast was nice but very expensive close to tram excellent room nice staff renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at     am and woke you up there is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of   euros for nothing in the room they dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of   from you no positive the room wasn t cleaned two days in a row i don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times good wi fi no negative good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp no noise problem but the lovely garden is gone sill good value for money this is a big place lovely old building at first glance it looks like a dream hotel but then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom but at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room the doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room there really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors in addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you clean room we had not exchanged towels for   days until we asked the best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with   hotel having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room having to ask for towels that were not left in the room room   no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc character of the hotel was great location was goodno negative hotel and rooms were beautiful my friend and i wanted some luxury on our trip to amsterdam and this hotel provided just that the staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc you will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip would definitely recommend this hotel the only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests it was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future the staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them the room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for no on site car park available despite pre booking of this hotel was a building site so not very welcoming no privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had no positive next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked i didn t try it way better than the usual amsterdam culinary sinsno negative this was our first time in amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful they took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at    am great location lovely room the room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram the hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy especially the entrance area is affected but the hotel does need a facelift boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms no negative it was a well kept hotel in a lovely area the staff and services offered were excellent we felt it was a great value our beautiful room with a view was a bonus its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking  mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway this is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive also i would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance no noise or dirt at all the hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on oosterpark which is awesome the location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and     mins to poi convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city you can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about    mins very clean room made and towels changed everyday almost perfect no convenient stores surrounding hotel area had to walk quite far for grocery shopping crews being nice and helpful environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction the pillow and the double charged city tax one of the staff at the reception is not so nice the bathroom and sofa are so good the building style is really awesome we don t like the open concept shower it gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though the hotel room was otherwise very nice we liked the location and the extra pleasant staff they were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows no negative i loved the hotel design and decoration staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling that is something you really appreciate when you are on a   hour business trip breakfast was way better than i expected although coffee was quite bad that is something most hotels fail to nail and i think most guests find it important rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable iron wasn t very good bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it building works took away from quality of hotel we didn t like they reserved   on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done the bed was comfy and large the wifi was fast and good separate living area powerful showerno negative got in late and hadn t eaten   hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at  pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is   mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town no negative we stayed at the hotel for   nights hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes hotel is situated in a quite area the rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy the staff is very nice and helpful theres nothing we was unhappy with really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at  am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airportno negative the matress and pillows were exceptionally good best sleep in terms of comfort ever i would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home the rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding the hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space i was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside fantastic value for money but i assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in amsterdam the bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite the hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of amsterdam in only     minutes our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room   was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food n a this is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay there is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history also the shower was incredible no negative we loved our stay at hotel arena the hotel was great staff was really kind especially for job the guy encharged of the restaurant and sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and i got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel that night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room it was a very classy detail we were so thankful about it also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant food is great thank u for everything hotel arenaaa it s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre everything the friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar it was truly pleasant to stay in hotel arena no bad experiences amazing rooms with beautiful view of river food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon staff are helpful and friendly floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate hall way to rooms on  nd floor was too dark gloomy reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in i question the   star rating staff good location suited us the bathroom needed to be deep cleaned tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating great historic buildig there was a problem with the hairdryer in our room the hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror just a minor detail really but a bit annoying the hotel was great the rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive the hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes there were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times how different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram accessno negative this is an older building with a wonderful refurbishment our bedroom and bathroom were state of the art and perfect the dining experience was also excellent we had a problem with one meal but it was fixed immediately will go back the variety of the breakfast was not as good empty marmalade coffee was more water was convenient because our friends live close by furhthermore i liked the possibility of renting a bike on short notice and the interior was spectacular liked the modern twist small room in   levels connected by a very narrow and small steps the room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window the terrace lounge the building the location our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night the staff were very friendly and very helpful rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more very comfortable big bed free wi fi lovely building and interior the only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay   days this wasn t an issue a great place that is stylishly decorated the beds are really comfortable and the shower is fantastic the room we had also featured a lovely little loft with two chairs a desk and a tv the extra space made the place a lot nicer than your standard hotel room no negative i loved the room there was so much space spanning two floors the staff were super friendly and gave us great advice on locations to visit during our stay in amsterdam a bit noisy you can hear a lot through the walls it s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look there are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to central and both go to the main tourist hub oosterpark right on your door step service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building location outside terras minimal space around the bed breakfast was very good but it wasn t included in the price of the room right by the ostpark which is very pleasantno negative super stylish hotel next to a lovely park close enough to the city centre but far enough if you get me no negative standard room is amazing location is adorable everything was stunning from a to z from indoors design to really good noise isolation our room was small air con leaked and staff wasn t very helpful outside of the hotel was beutiful and the surrounding areas the hotel was under renovation while we there which we were not advised of before booking the bed was very comfortable and the room was very cleanno negative location was superb overlooking oosterpark nice and quiet away from the city centre tram stops very close by and metro not far away overcharging for the parking lot room was as shown on the pictures cozy posh and really stylish staff was trully polite and helpful nearly everything about my stay the only thing i love was that the bed was comfy and the building on the outside everything else i hated service in the restaurant was very slow and not the best beautiful hotel with views of the park transport links are very close and excellent i booked a twin room so thought there would be twin beds but got put in a double room with a double bedno positive wifi service wasn t great and we couldn t actually connect large clean rooms with a nice size comfy bed all round just very clean could hear other people shutting doors but didn t bother us much at all the room was so clean and tidy the bed was amazingly comfey and so big it s just a little bit out of the centre about   min walk to the centre we loved this hotel and our beautiful hotel room no negative we stayed in a studio room the room was spacious it was clean the bed was very comfortable the staff were helpful polite and professional there is no enough space in the room my room even to put your clothes the architecture the bar area the staff are kind and helpful a little far from the centre but trams frequent bed was so comfortable staff we very helpful had a nice stay at this hotel room had a bad smell radiator was making leaking sound hotel was under construction noises started at   am building was so nice rooms were bigno negative the hotel building is amazing they are renovating and perhaps some of the problems will be overcome when the works finish bit noisy dark hallways nice room with bedside on a loft and the nice gesture for a free drink due to renovation of the premises no negative staff were very helpful they even organised a little surprise on my birthday room was great very spacious with huge bed the room felt cramped the staff at breakfast was a little to busy to help out when asked the breakfast area is niceno negative the staff was very friendly and helpful loved the old charm of the architecture rooms were clean bar had a great courtyardno negative staff were incredibly polite and willing to help at all times hotel is in a very good location and facilities are brilliant the shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet the room was so luxurious very comfy bed and modern decor hotel had character the hotel was situated a little too far out of town lovely room taseful decor and artwork around the hotel friendly and helpful staff really nothing negative to say about this hotel very comfortable beds smart bathroom good shower lovely facilities garden an absolute delight friendly staff quiet location no coffee or tea in the room or lobby no one to help with our bags from tax into the hotel no handicapped access at   years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the   oursidestairs and then up into the lobby no positive room was pretty small for the three of us the staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants nothing really we stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation it has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings would definitely stay there again only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others   pounds plus tip super location on division underground line direct to heathrow and central london older facility but very accommodating staff good breakfast many restaurant stores     block away bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish quite comfy but small rooms beautiful garden in back overall a great value for london would stay here again london hotel rooms are very small there was very little storage would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory plenty of choices for all bed was very comfortable bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water location could not have been better very short walk to underground beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel very quiet in spite of being close to earl s court rd staff was friendly and helpful everyone was very easy to deal with the room for three people was on the small side there was a beautiful garden at the back of the property where guests could relax in the sunshine read order a drink etc a great location very close to earls court restaurants and tube good breakfast room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from leeds to london and phoning  hours away to reserve parking rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space we arrived at     and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further  minutes just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for   night and had a concert to go to fantastic location very clean room someone called leanne i think on reception was helpful and kind breakfast was lovely great choice our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet we had to require a different room at an extra cost of   a night breakfast was excellent staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table the cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good the garden was a bonus lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink secure parking was also a good feature the room was a lot smaller than advertised i requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the  nd floor they changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at  am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise once reported to the front desk i was asked to move rooms at  am no assistance was offered second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much i thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable i didn t find the staff very friendly they weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe the gym is not worth calling a gym has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the earl s court underground station clean quiet breakfast was a good quality and selection nice pillows lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains newly remodeled marble slate bathroom mini fridge in room desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up beautiful garden area i didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area lower ground floor room l  possibly the smallest bathroom i ve ever stayed in awful view from windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside won t go back location first and foremost lovely gardens dimensions of the room small but i m was a single room and erls court london the space cost money as a traditional london hotel very good hotel professional people s and very well organized unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure i will pay for this not more than   p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level squeaky floors difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband also  th floor our window didn t open to the outside clean comfy beds beautiful gardens excellent helpful staff no negative the staff were all so professional and friendly they really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made the hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the earl s court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions i would totally recommend the k k hotel george not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first we were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days and we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements it was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and b b in which we stayed on this three week uk vacation we would not recommend k k hotel george nor would we return ourselves small but modern and well furnished room nice linens and a superior small bathroom the hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us the hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family the hotel has a inside garden beautiful english style where you feel relax with a glass of beer it s very close to the earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night we like this hotel the front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips fortunately i could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions additionally i was not entirely confident that they understood the questions i was asking in english fantastic breakfast buffet great location quiet rooms no negative we stay at this hotel each time we are in london in a nice quiet street just a short walk to earls court underground station the staff are always friendly rooms are always cleaned properly it s just a nice place to return to after a long day in london great buffet breakfastno negative great position lovely having breakfast overlooking beautiful garden which you could have a walk around or seat and relax staff were very helpful and friendly staff not very friendly did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed location near the earl s court underground very convenient restaurants nearby good location away from the tourist bustle but very easy to get around london via the tube room size too small and it was too hot our window was too small and it good lighting we stayed on the  th floor and i believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there the staff was very helpful the room was a little stuffy they didn t have ac on yet probably too early in the season shower sometimes went hot and then cold hotel was nice and comfortable very clean room was a bit small but adequate staff was friendly and helpful the location was great because it was a   minute walk from   underground lines plenty of restaurants convenience stores and atm nearby the shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back we really liked the breakfast there was a wide choice of food the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants it is also close to the subway station no negative room as advertised excellent location a   minute walk to buses and the tube friendly and helpful front desk staff would love to stay here on our next london trip too choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem quiet comfy room very helpful staff excellent location just off the earls court tube and lots of excellent places to eat close by the fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential closeness to piccadilly line and general ambience of the hotel the rooms are very small we had trouble fitting   suitcases in the price is fairly high even by london s standards and breakfast was extra the location is excellent direct route from the airport at heathrow the hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar the street is quiet a good hotel if travelling on business the room is a little small and the decor is dated the staff were superb very helpful and friendly the hotel is in an excellent position close to the underground station and easy to get to the room was very clean and well serviced each day air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples the location was excellent   mins from tube and walkable to several locations kensington palace albert hall knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile we received a complimentary upgrade on the room bed was lovely and comfortable hotel was lovely staff friendly and attentive as is just off main road nice and quiet can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need i always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes i would you ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why lovely hotel for a special occasion we needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe the toasts were but nothing else not the table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together potato cakes had gluten including flours they seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food we had gluten free breakfast they had separate toaster for gluten free breads but i can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet otherwise i can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast i just could not eat it still for sure i could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast enough for a big man it was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms friendly stuff clean location breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great perfect location close to all transports nice and clean hotel friendly staff and a really nice garden the area was nice and quiet rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean i absolutely love this hotel the staff is great the rooms are small but comfortable the location cannot be beat this hotel is a   min walk to the tube station and from there you can get anywhere you need to go bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in location for tube and central london plus some nice restaurants close by too staff were very pleasant breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too the wifi is only  kb s which isn t fast by today s standards the power socket near the bed was loosen i can t charge my phone generally it s a wonderful experience the hotel is within walking distance of earl s court station very convenient location there re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel the staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman the room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases the tv is new and major english tv programs are provided mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so i can make some tea complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided the cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found bath towels and amenities are changed everyday the surrounding area is safe to hang around during night it costs only around   pounds per night which is a good deal no negative the breakfast was perfect very clean parking was easy to reach and available even we left the hotel one night to go to leeds very kind of the hotel we were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a   star room how ever it was clean and bed was comfortable the location is definitely the main selling point wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using chrome breakfast coffee was only average good quality breakfast food friendly and efficient staff we choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was     th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive the room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open staff was very friendly and helpful the location was great the room was very quiet not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular great location with very easy access to public transport and popular location major shopping streets walkable a very comfortable hotel top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath lethal combination for the elderly or children second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated front desk staff very dismissive beds very comfortable pleasant and necessary lounge area off reception with excellent bar staff area good for restaurants the breakfast staff were not helpful when we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about   minutes to be seated they forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table after   minutes we were finally seated i was so upset i did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment we won t be back staff were courteous and helpfulno negative location is excellent and easy to get into central london and choice of local restaurants fab staff at the hotel are friendly and accommodating rooms are spacious very comfortable and clean breakfast options excellent and bar area very comfortable and cosy big plus is underground parking at the hotel also fab experience all round couldn t work out how to crank down the heating in the room bathroom is miniscule mini bar was very limited with its choice good sized room for the price and wonderfully located having its own bar and restaurant on site was a bonus despite there being countless foodie drinkie options outside their doors no negative excellent location near major railway lines easy to get from the airport friendly and helpful staff a homely atmosphere and personal attention highly recommended breakfast is expensive especially when i have already paid over   for a standard room per night location for central london is perfect hotel is very clean mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords also it would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a   euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions when we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith very good location restaurants and supermarkets around and the clineanliness of the hotel the only thing i can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her teddybears   clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table the underground is only a   minute walk so getting around was very easy i am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it no negative i especially liked my room s well operating walk in non slip shower and bathroom an amenity not always found in other london hotels i also liked the comfortable bed the size of room the good elevators lifts and the proximity to earl s court tube buses cafes shops and atms no negative thank you k k hotel george at earl s court you assured our stay in london was fun and despite some snow cozy and pleasant thank you for accommodating our every need from booking theatre tickets to providing cutlery for our take away even letting us borrow the hdmi cable from the business centre everyone is so knowledgeable and helpful and kind cannot wait try your other locations thank you again kkhotelgeorge kkhotelgeorge i had to ask at breakfast all   mornings we were there for coffee and re fills i think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea very good location for tube station and getting around all the sights and shows we had pre booked my one complaint is the overly soft mattresses it was not good for my back friendly helpful staff the facilities are good including the bar the earl s court tube station is just a few steps away and this station has access to several useful lines for what you get the prices are reasonable very nice breakfast buffet the mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft i had a neck ache the next morning the room was super tiny we stayed at the hilton bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison the location was just     minutes from earl s court paul s was also opposite the underground station making it very convenient to pop by for breakfast excellent espresso cappucino and freshly baked pastries by the way before heading off for sightseeing temperature in the room was difficult to regulate the staff are really helpful and accommodating nothing was too much trouble the hotel is very pretty in a great location with a cosy bar area i have stayed here several times and will definitely stay again i don t know if it was because i booked through booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place underground with no view unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as i should have done it on check in i didn t know what i was going to be doing on check in tea and biscuits not replenished the second day the location really nothing this was a perfect choice the entire staff were friendly courteous and helpful the room was clean and quiet and the breakfast was excellent as was the location   minute walk to the underground tube just perfect rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters gym is open from     pm to    pm when you usually are out location heated outdoor smoking area breakfast is good just   min walk to earls court station halal restaurants are very close by soiled chair in room pillows not clean shower temp control very sensitive in  st room we stayed in value for money helpful friendly staff good locationno negative excellent hotel in every aspect fantastic location with only a     minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central london rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom all the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone we asked for   singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation there were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work to be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so comfy bed a lovely warm room with good facilities on a cold damp london day great shower nice toiletries and fab fluffy towels would stay again as it was a great location the things we didn t like weren t the end of the world and we enjoyed our stay no iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about location fantastic   minute walk to earl court tube shops and restaurants beautiful building with parking did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much loo very low lucky i am only  ft   delicious english breakfast staff very helpful and pleasant staff not particularly helpful have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this   times breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a   rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm its in the right area for what we need housekeeping missed my room one day and although i did not make much of a fuss over it i did not get a convincing explanation i did get an apology though english breakfast everyday was a welcome bonus bar is not impressive but well run kudos to mariusz who looked after me room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited overallthe hotel was worth themoney and really handy for the tube good local pub for a great breakfast bathroom is really small great location near the underground   breakfast room size consider good when compared to london hotels super fast wifi staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what i asked for i requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin so was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed i was advised i had been upgraded this was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the tv was much smaller clearly not an upgrade i don t know i guess for   i was expecting a lot more for a   night stay on checking in i was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate i didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately and not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter appreciate i had arrived  mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset location was pretty good with decent restaurants in walking distance wifi did the job range of tv channels shower was lovely weird atmosphere in reception many eastern european staff room cold and uninspiring   per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water overpriced overall location near earls court tube stop front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission he tried to net an extra   on my bill with the horrible exchange rate when i caught it he told me i must have authorized it at check in which i had not completely unacceptable good english breakfast the towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations staff on the front desk we re very welcoming the gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym very short walk from the tube but not on the main road ideal location two years in a row we checked in for   days on booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the  pm check in time no effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room last year our friends from the midlands arrived for a   night stay while we were there and at  am sharp their room was ready and they got in let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night who do you take care of location location location and breakfast saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening wonderful bed impeccably clean room staff are very helpful and polite the air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc our room on the  th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about   m  comfortable beds quality breakfast nice and helpful staff short walk to the tube the bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days i stayed for   nights the cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them they also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them the location the room was a little bigger for the usual london hotel room the staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel they provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic i enjoyed my stay overall it was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room   if it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy comfortable bed the heating was not working in the room for the first two days very well kept hotel with a lovely garden staff particularly friendly and professional a very nice room i think this may be a london thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot in our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower very dated apart from the tv if like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would i stay again not if it was free is the answer the location was good on a quiet street about   meters from the earls court tube and buses close to some nice restaurants and pubs for breakfast lunch or dinner noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional very comfortable beds well lit room bathroom compact but worked well the staff were all polite and helpful good gardens and quiet location the room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight the staff are friendly and kindly to help our room is not in the basement and it s clean especially the bathroom which we care most briefly it s a good hotel in this price we ll choose to stay again next time i can t think of a thing that needed improved upon all aspects of my stay were excellent stayed in room   comfy bed and pillows quiet room facing lovely garden super clean and neat good size flat screen tv with lots of channels staff wonderfully helpful food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants two minute walk from earl s court tube also every convenience a traveler could want located right on earl s court road several bank atms pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even america fast food if you need your fix mcdonald s burger king kfc and starbucks there s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry i always remind my fellow americans who are not used to european hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to us standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank far higher in my opinion than wasted floor space definitely not a   star hotel triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion except for the reception ladies staff very rude definitely not reccomended being in london in the same area several times and there are definitely better real   stars the position of the hotel was very close to earl s court tube stationno negative the location was perfect stones through away from earls court station staff were all lovely and accommodating gardens were lovely cracking thai restaurant round the corner too rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy we didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until  pm for people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest very small room dated interior the cleaning could improve my room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed the bed was loosing boards underneath it the staff was helpful and friendly the lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant it is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help bed linen is so cozy lovely breakfast super showers and staff are great and friendly there is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in october so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep air con at this time of the year is opening the windows location excellent staff very helpful we only stayed   nights the location was perfect close to the underground restaurants etc yet quiet the food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful the staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful the room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden perfect conclusion to our   week stay in the ukno negative this is the second k k hotel i stayed at the other was in barcelona it s a great boutique hotel the hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside you re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for london would definitely stay here again there was nothing that we can think of the room key is very large and there is only one they ask that you turn it in when you go out it s a little eccentric but ok it was small but comfortable and very quiet the garden was beautiful breakfast was very good staff was friendly and helpful it is located only two blocks from the tube there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room   no positive the room was really really cold the heating didn t work i was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference this led to a really bad nights sleep quiet roomno negative k k is a heath hotel that can a person stay on i like it a lot i get a beautiful welcome i think to come next year with my family and thank you for all thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy no scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs should be constantly monitored this is a deceptively large and busy hotel i requested somewhere within close walking distance to olympia   min walk is not that close staff great friendly acomodating in particular reception staff and bar man wednesday night you can open a bedroom window the bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot the mattress was orthopaedic firm staff were very helpful breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements long periods without eggs etc very limited selection of vegetables and salad would probably expect better breakfast from a   star place very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys only a short walk to nearest subway nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff nice breakfast restaurant will come back again don t believe there was anything we didn t like my personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but i was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint the hotel is incredibly handy to earl s court station we loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet g t at the end of each hectic day in london we ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located there was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing we ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well personally i think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin excellent location you have the access to earl s court underground within   minutes walk district and piccadilly lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially heathrow without any transfer many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than   person a table for brochures also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc these were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors house keeping quality and service very good even folded our clothes breakfast was unbelievable you even had stewed prunes first floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks liked the breakfast being made available with room price obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also would consider staying here again no negative although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city nothing could have been better honestly and i m very critical and picky i love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street the breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious the rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you the whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive west end hotel but with a cosy feel to it it s my favourite hotel in london and i ve stayed in quite a few no negative this is the second time i stay in this hotel it s clean and bed is calling my comfortable also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarketsno negative close to city center  mins away from tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast it took them   days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to   different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there againno positive the breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning it would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining we would have been happy to pay for it too instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day we noticed many guests doing the same this hotel was a great value near the tube station in earl s court it was one of the few places in london that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter it was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything there was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring why carp when there is nothing to carp about staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service breakfast buffet is first rate easy access to rest of london esp old brompton road and knotting hill the official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like i did location is very useful for heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight the place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good the room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open it was very hot in london while i was there so it wasn t really under their control great location easy transportation to everything walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores room was very quiet and comfortable the atm machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress the breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated we especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled great taxi service was provided when requested the bathroom was cramped it was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily the shower spilled water out all over the floor there was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction the breakfast was very disappointing it was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar we had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well i also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked the bacon was quite watery the selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better the beds and decor were nice it was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night we chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night we had a fantastic stay at the k k george very easy access to earls court tube which goes straight to heathrow as well as being a great start to explore london easily quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in room was very comfortable and well serviced breakfast had lots of choice really a lovely base for a holiday in london bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs location close to some shops and restaurants only   minutes walk underground   minutes walk polite and assistive staff room space is good nothing really a lower price is always good of course excellent location quiet but easy access to transport quiet room plenty big enough very clean with attractive garden views very good breakfast friendly and helpful staff would be very happy to stay there again wifi was a bit slow location was excellent as it was very close to earls court station and to the main high street staff were friendly and breakfast was really good we were given the executive room which has direct access to the beautiful garden my whole family loved this hotel and for sure will book it again when i travel to london housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue great food very nice bar staff ex suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before the temperature of the room could not be lower than   degrees which wasn t cool enough no positive the bathroom is on the smaller side excellent location on a quiet street just around the corner from earl s court tube station easy acess from heathrow airport   minutes by underground a garden at the back adds great value on a summer s day the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold it is a smart comfortable hotel and our room was quiet which was something i specifically asked for but room was small but adequate there was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though i put some paper on it to indicate its existence fire alarm went off at   am and we were all in the street for a while all was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation a lovely choice at breakfast with freshly cooked food staff were pleasant and helpful good late checkout time fire alarm and semi evacuation at   am little or no direction by staff reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear no subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident convenient location for our purpose clean and comfortable rooms the room it was fairly small it wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central london shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either lovely hotel great location for earls court tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of london sightseeing and very quiet we had a great sleep both nights nothing really very comfy beds and helpful staff easy walk to the tube station price we secured was very good access to computers and printers very helpful our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke the blackout blind didn t work very well the hotel and the rooms were very nicely presented clean and functional beds were very comfortable nothing beautifully kept large sized garden with separate areas for sitting for drinks afternoon tea beautiful view of garden from room very nicely appointed with fresh modern decor in lobby lounge and rooms no problems at all with a small pet very convenient to well connected earls court tube station air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead well located very clean and good sized rooms bar food and breakfast was excellent staff very friendly and helpful definitely stay again they weren t inexpensive the room was clean the buffet offered plenty of variety and the staff couldn t have been better leann in particular stood out but everyone was eager to please knowledgeable and responsive farthest room from elevator uncomfortable bed air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room staff were not interested when told about it we did not sleep well because of it no positive room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking location very convenient to tube nice garden area to sit in after a long day breakfast buffet was very niceno negative conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street very quiet since it s in a back lane nice view from the fifth floor cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic air con did not work so called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge we have been here many times but the added cost over   a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal like the location as i chose it myself breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable bed very comfy room was really tiny and i don t think was good value for money but i would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel everything except the space in the room tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving the old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early   s but not anymore and would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a   per night room instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink the beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious the staff are polite and helpful small room some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options great selection for breakfast buffet hotel location great near earls court tube station loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage hotel has a bar high is convenientno negative we had a lovely stay at k k the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful when we arrived at     am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the wellness center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until  pm that really saved the day and we had an amazing day in london wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired excellent staff breakfast was great with a good choice room very comfortable location is brilliant and there is very little street noise no negative the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming the bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business i didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there the location to the tube was excellent rigid rules our plane arrives in the morning so i requested early check in in the booking acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel we arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone i started with good morning i know it s too early but i wonder if you ve got a room for us i booked   rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport he replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at  pm leave you baggage over there he then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more the tags are in pairs   to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining   pairs to me as i realised it was self service i did the   bags by myself and before i could finish he already rushed me to take my tags i can t believe he could be so rude we brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out we were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around  nn by then we were offered   room i saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and i am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already i let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard my bf and i waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them we waited till  pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though i requested for it when i made the booking and no reply as well and during the check in i had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info i have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself i understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way location is good   mins to earl s court station loads of restaurants nearby tranquil neighbourhood clean free printing stable wifi took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying very comfortable beds very quiet despite facing the street excellent breakfast great location friendly staff close to good restaurants and pubs not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid aside from that the hotel was lovely room was basic for the price we paid it was very hot in the room and not very much room in the bathroom spotlessly clean and good location its a hit and miss with the reception staff sometimes i got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained the restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly i love the location and working wi fi the double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate the breakfast was excellent the garden at the back of the hotel was superb the children could run around let off steam whilst we had a drink in the garden the staff were very friendly excellent location no negative the room was compact but bright and nicely decorated staff very friendly and helpful peaceful street but very close to earl s court tube would stay there again occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or   floor above quite disturbing expensive good location in earls court quiet and comfortable the size of the room is small for americans but pretty standard for europe the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid  pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious the price for breakfast is a little high i liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot let me think about it nothing really perfect location in south west london very serene and close to the tube station about   meters many restaurants around and nice walk to hyde park very clean and decent place the restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing the room was spacious and very clean and the location meant it was incredibly easy for us to get about on the underground i can t think of a single thing refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds we had the classic twin which like most london hotels was small but adequate we suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet location is great as only a block away from the tube with the picadilly line leading direct to covent garden and the theatres having stayed here a few times before i thought i would have a pleasant stay as usual i was wrong for a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way those used to be good in this hotel not when i visited this time i ll look for somewhere else for my next trip no positive the toilet was too low to the floor the room was much too hot and the windows did not open the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely all very clean there was nothing in the mini fridge it was empty i would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service the bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby the staff was friendly and helpful the printing center was also very convenient the toilet is slightly small though it contains everything the floor is wooden so you could hear people walking it will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep but for travellers just coming to london this does not count unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized the location is great which is only   munites walk from earl s court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around the room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in london it only takes about   munites going from heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in london not very early i will definitely prefer this hotel next time the rooms were extremely small i don t think the breakfast was good value for money loved the location so easy to access the subway and coffee shops and restuarantsno negative great location just round the corner from earls court station easy access to all main attractions comfy room breakfast excellent choice staff very friendly would definately stay again on our next trip to london the room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows very helpful staff willing to help great breakfast and not rushed away as could sit and chat over breakfast great choice of food in pleasant dining room wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great this is an excellent hotel location is amazing just minutes from earl s court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the city we could easily walk to kensington high street hyde park natural history museum etc excellent shower phenomenal water pressure room was clean bed was very comfortable staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants breakfast was very good the hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out we will be back room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room bathroom very small and toilet very low good location parking available although quite expensive close to subway no negative staff are always joyful and helpful we were under booked totally my fault by   day and on site manager extended our stay in the same room for another thanks for that and also guiding us to the pick up point for our tour of highclare castle so kind of all of your staff thanks doug pat brugger no water to drink in spa area room on small side compared to advertised twin room kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in excellent breakfast could open window in bedroom was quiet outside for london lovely to have a garden great mini spa after hectic city no negative reception area appealing check in and out quick bedroom good size nice and light lovely view of hotel garden bed extremely comfortable and experienced a good few nights sleep did not experience any noise disturbance excellent choices for breakfast very enjoyable staff very helpful providing us with information and travel advice breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne now more english breakfast which means the cost is pricey at   pounds wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times location very convenient walking distance to tube station room clean and comfortable size staff very friendly in hotel the bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom there is a lack of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless the parking is very reasonable for central london the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is great no negatives quiet position but close to tube station only two stops to major museums staff friendly and efficient room very clean and comfortable excellent breakfast rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy the location is perfect close to the tube around the corner great breakfast and good value my room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling i arrived early in the morning after a long trip from africa i was able to take a shower and change clothes in the wellness centre which made the day fo me perfect for   nights in transit between a long journey from africa and a really long journey to nz quiet yet less than   minute walk to piccadilly line at earl s court even dragging heavy suitcase the bathrooms ar very small but everything you need is there they were also spotless great location very clean great breakfasts nice big towels that were changed every day comfortable beds internet worked well also a plus that the guests have access to a computer internet with a printer in the lobby serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always   coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time good spacious enough room and bathroom excellent location near earl s court underground station very nice breakfast buffet very good internet facilities with printer access even very nice garden with seating facilities no negative my go to place when in london this was my  th stay great location within walking distance from earl s court underground station piccadilly line from heathrow staff is friendly rooms are up to date and clean nothing we loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport above good location put us next to a smoking room and two of us asmathic staff were so rude when we brought it up they eventually moved us to a new room which was a massive downgrade and one of us had to sleep on a camp bed no apology was offered bathroom a bit small brilliant location hotel comfortable and clean staff very friendly and helpful lovely view over london from our  th floor room breakfast excellent lovely garden wouldn t hesitate to stay here again and recommend it very good value for money room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there great location   minutes from earl s court tube station nice room great shower good value for price breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians great location and parking delivered wine to celebrate my wife birthday thankyou things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking have stayed here before very comfortable good showers good breakfast breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive decent selection however of food attended the chelsea v psg game and opted to stay here after a great stay a few weeks ago had a free upgrade which was a lovely surprise parking was handy and safe but quite expensive the view from our room was lovely the breakfast was very tasty with plenty of choices and the easy location with the tube ride into leicester square just one stop away superb the bathroom was tiny and the pillows a bit lumpy but nothing terrible we stayed as a family to do a couple of days sightseeing hotel was in a good area for getting around close to tube and with an underground car park rooms comfy good breakfast and a nice bar shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction great selection at breakfast extra comfortable beds and linen great price through booking com nothing could have been better it was perfect never slept in such a restful bed the duvet and pillow were like sleeping in a cloud breakfast was full of flavour with good quality produce and plenty of variety cooked breakfast not very imaginative too small plates can t cook eggs room not as big as i hoped for in exec room king size bed good bed clean the room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season the hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing that is almost a fraud the breakfast is not nearly what it used to be it was okay but not a reason to come any more the location still is a reason location just first class in many ways room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows breakfast is excellent good choice and offer porridge which is always a bonus staff recognised that we had stayed before and welcomed us back waiting staff at breakfast were very attentive bath towels were beautifully white and fluffy bed comfy and the room was spotless the room had a beautiful view of the gardens this is why we came back nothing at all everything great location underground around the corner we had a room on the street side and it was very quiet fantastic breakfast friendly staff beautiful room the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back the breakfast was the best buffet breakfast we have had everything hot and plenty of choice it was great to have water and fruit in the room a nice touch the bedding was lovely duvet really snuggly the pull out mirror in the bathroom really useful the bathroom is quite small but did have a tub the location the tea kettle the cosmetics quality linens nice neighborhood attractive bar and lobby fitness looked small but fine staff smiling try the blackbird pub in front of the station to the right wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in   to dont provide proper wifi had to work from the toilet where the signal was here clean price is correct the only bad thing i can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small not much space to move very helpful staff all premises were kept really clean a very good breakfast and you can eat all you can the garden at the bakc of the building really nice if the weather is good room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in london and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand the hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on saturday our room was not ready on time having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one conscientious staff who worked hard to make our stay a pleasant one room and hotel was clean and well presented good location near the tube for the museums double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside but then this is a london old hotel very helpful staff great choice of food at breakfast clean and recently refurbished close to underground station insufficient uk power points for a couple on business without requesting uk adaptors breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot gym could do with an update room was a little too compact great secluded garden would be fantastic in summer very helpful and friendly staff bed room comfortable and very quiet dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there very littleno negative excellent base for short visits to london v good breakfast charming garden well maintained and equipped if small rooms tube station   mins walk very definitely the breakfast fruit selection limited very little input from staff many   star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table the fried eggs were dry and inedible they clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished the outlook on to the garden was lovely beds very comfy the room for   person are not very big and another very bad surprise is with booking hotel i made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused the location is very good in near the subway the staff and breakfast are excellent bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit very nice staff and comfortable and quiet room very friendly welcome and very helpful desk staff no negative fine hotel very clean great breakfast and nice bar staff very helpful access to pc and printer proper access even from iphone very close to tube station highly recommended my only thing i would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited i am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything i liked however the breakfast was lovely the room was great i couldn t ask for a better night sleep the sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities staff were excellent very friendly and helpful we had a problem develop with the toilet running water and it was resolved within half hour of being reported very efficient service in all areas nothing the location was great on the picadilly line so very easy to get to central london and heathrow the staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable really enjoyed the stay thin wall can hear everything on the hallway i would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by great location good breakfast clean and modern hotel some mentioned the rooms to be tiny but i thought it was a good size room for london room got a bit cold but the heater in the room worked really well unlike some of the reviews i read also the front desk called to check in and see if the room was alright nice touch of customer service worst nights sleep in a long long time pillows were awful gave me a bad neck couldn t turn the heating off i barely slept due to how hot it was bathroom was absolutely stifling no positive first night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel requested a fan for our room but did not receive one cleanliness efficiency and ease of location comparatively quiet to other hotels i ve stayed at in london too front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us the scrambled eggs did not taste good at all very buttery and watery the breakfast buffet had a good selection nothing could have been better this is one of if not the best hotels i ve stayed in for it s attention to detail this is a perfect hotel i loved the huge fluffy towels comfortable be soft pillows perfect breakfast free newspapers the staff and the free newspaper the location is superb no negative often the reality is different from the website but in the case of hotel george the photos really did portray reality i could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel i chose this hotel because the average review was amazing this was spot on it s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked who could want for more a little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in excellent location and very welcoming staff great to spend a couple of nights at one of the most desirable postcodes in the country rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was coldno positive room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down amazing location great value for money staff friendly and helpful and breakfast delicious no negative location was absolutely perfect just round the corner from earl s court tube station but not at all noisy room was spacious and offered really good value for money bed in room   was appalling and needs replacement to compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means i was not the first to complain location and staff old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small comfortable rooms and fluffy towels and plenty of them good to have a bath after a long day very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied   yards to olympia it was not pleasant bar area food good clean bathroom bed is too hard pillows were horrible ac didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi wouldn t recommend it at all location and the staff were friendly the bathroom was far too small for an executive room the key of my room did not work properly very good location nice quiet neighbourhood friendly staff and good breakfast breakfast times could start earlier mon friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff wi fi speed extremely slow the bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest     for a pint of larger is a little extreme reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them new management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its   rating for long comfortable hotel in convenient location didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available we were lucky to have a space will book in future close to underground station but in a quiet location staff were excellent pleasant and helpful good choice for breakfast the bed was so comfortable we didn t want to get up nothing most value for money staffs are very friendly and nice location is great actually i booked   hotels during this trip i think k k is most valuable absolutely will book again on next trip no negative quiet location nice staff especially jose and svietlana good breakfast what more a little bit small bathroom not a big problem for me unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom the hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning i was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it i stayed for one night and the hotel is beautiful in a great location staff were very nice lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open good location nice friendly staff the hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like ikea the gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails the hotel is clean in good location the breakfast wasn t bad the room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat the staff were very obliging and provided a good service restaurant looks out onto a well kept garden which would be lovely in summer rooms could have been a bit bigger design and decor dated all clean and well maintained staff excellent ideal location for our visit to the albrt hall nothing very close to underground very close to shops and restaurants quiet location very nice modern hotel even with a garden breakfast was very goodno negative very comfortable double room excellent breakfast very courteous and helpful staff very close to the tube many good restaurants in the area walking distance nothing really important good breakfast free wi fi good bar lovely room with a nice view to the hotel s garden great bathroom with a very good shower excellent locationno negative easy to get to from the tube station staff friendly room was clean the location was quiet hotel was well presented good bars and restuarants within walking distance room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards you can hear it clearly every time someone uses it definitely ask for a room away from one there is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard the pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station friendly hotel staff clean room and bathroom with nice big shower no negative a boutique style hotel it had a lovely garden nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use complimentary fresh fruit plate for us the breakfast was superb gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates quiet location but within minutes of bustle a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light very nice staff at the front desk this was my sixth visit in k k hotel george i brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast there was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy near earl s court metrostation really easy to reach staff was very friendly no negative very good continental breakfast excellent location close to earls court tube station the k and k has a very good value and totally refurbished i really recommend it the room was small and very warm even with air conditioning it was situated beside the lift even though i requested a quiet room the bathroom was even smaller the hotel is located only a   minute walk from earls court tube and situated on a quiet street staff are welcoming friendly and knowledgeable the hotel and room was spotless breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of both continental and english room a little on the small side though perfect for one person food in room service could have been a little more interesting good coffee though excellent location helpful staff comfortable room heated bathroom floor and lovely towels nice and big room was adjacent to staircase on  th fnloor sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast style breakfast bar meals great staff small rooms perfect location great value very comfortable beds we arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great nice lobby right next to earls court tube stop so plenty of travel links tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area english breakfast was not too good and a little cold however they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the english and there was plenty of choice lovely hotel with friendly staff very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating we had a room overlooking the garden which was nice excellent location would definitely stay here again the room little bit small but for couple is enough in london you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok there is no air condition in the room or it was not working it was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in january the price per night is very good relatively to other   stars hotels in london the location is very good   minutes walk from earl s court metro station at piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in london direct from the heathrow airport and to all the popular locations in london near the hotel there is   big supermarket     good restaurants and   cafes the hotel very clean modern and new the breakfast very good not too expensive for full english breakfast   per person at any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more the bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean this is my second time i m staying in the k k hotels in europe they are very good bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for london hotels great location really near to earls court tube station and restaurants friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds nice hotel with modern touches definitely stay again no negative very convenient location for earl s court tube station warm welcome from reception staff good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon i filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed on arrival no reserved parking place because i only made a request lousy no wifi on  th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home location smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better excellent location for the price less than   mins walking to earl s court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the piccadilly line good breakfast prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again the staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill   metres and down   metres down its a accident waiting to happen the standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room we really appreciated that because we were going to spend   days in that hotel but even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all london hotels the room did not have central heating it was december and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold when we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold as in all london central hotels this hotel is also not value for money if it were say in munich or milan it definitely would be half this price its central location its proximity to metro station   min walk to earl s court underground station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides only one luft was in operation during peak season single room was quite small double rooms looked larger everything a boutique hotel should be well located on a quiet side street   minute walk to earls court station tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design really impressive my single room was quite small but well laid out i will go back liked it the best of   hotels i ve stayed in london see above tangent staff were indifferent and sullen i was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience i left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on   seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping i got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and i never heard from them about my items ever they also gave me a   year old folding cot bed with a   mattress to sleep on for   nights i would have thought   plus for   nights would have afforded me a bed yes i complained and they relented eventually although the location is fantasticly placed i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away i booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night the booking was made within   hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed when i arrived they insisted i pay for the canceled booking i should have just walked away but thought i could resolve it they were rude and steadfast in insisting i pay for the canceled night i contacted booking com to help resolve the situation booking com were very helpful recognized i had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue the hotel blankly refused not very nice people at all i would never stay again no positive we were promised the same room we had we left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator there was no division between the double bed and the single bed i had to insist they give us another room the manager did not want to go out of her way even though i insisted i finally said i would write a letter she gave us a double and single on a higher floor no positive breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the  nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds it was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean   didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in     had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited   minutes   too warm bar area and reception goodno negative we love everything about the hotel george the location the facilities the staff and as this was our  th stay in   years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been   i think that speaks for itself on my previous visit i had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel when i arrived there was a denial that i had made a booking this was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom i had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the  th dec   days after my original stay however my booking had been made with booking com on the  th dec so one way or another someone cocked up but i was blamed for the failure in their communication poor show on this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny the d cor was ok perhaps functional is an apt description there was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to earls court station was ideal no negative i went to london to visit my niece who was studying in london this hotel was ideally located in earl s court close to her apartment and the tube station very nice hotel and staff nice selection of food at breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at earl s court the website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic the parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail the bathroom was tiny room was ok if a little small and this was a king executive tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable i requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated room was small bathroom very small breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning coffee and tea not up to standard breakfast buffet was good location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden i like the fact that it is a small hotel plus i like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast they told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for   not   they know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast on the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station we were told   minutes to liverpool street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it we had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day the fare quoted was   we were charged   and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in   minutes i have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply very disappointed overall location staff and cleanliness attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out bathroom although clean was dated a bit  s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid i didn t realise this still happened in london great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like austrian apple strudel the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of     it was a private firm and not a london black cab although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke not pleasant good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom excellent choice of food at breakfast the bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire one of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife the rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful   minutes from earl s court tube hotel has everything you would want in london good breakfast comfortable room free wifi that works we had no ventilation in bathroom the location is superb close to central and all shopping areas as well as restaurants our room was good size very comfy excellent breakfast with big variety vegetarian and vegan options and bubbly the beds quite small room we asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room it was hidden in the cupboard the location the view from room   nice breakfast room with excellent breakfast and a nice view to the garden coffee and tea in room nothing the hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of earls court very friendly staff delicious breakfast we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely been before had a very good stay small rooms but very tidy room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours well connected and quite location great breakfast service and stuff room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot location excellent tube is close by so travel is easy breakfast excellent staff friendly rooms spotless bed was so soft and comfy nothing it s perfect excellent location   minutes to earl s court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from the first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory the view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor the place is nice and the breakfast is very good it was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option it s a hotel needs little updating continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the   days we stayed room wi fi was so so location near earls court underground was great newspapers and tv stations were good view of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room no bad experiences at all there was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel our room was very comfortable and a good size for a london hotel it was clean tidy and well equipped the staff were first class they were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot the breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality we will certainly pay a return visit no negative beautiful hotel great location friendly helpful staff good breakfast included in the price loved the help yourself nescafe in the lobby while waiting for breakfast thank you very expensive would not have stayed except meeting us family at same hotel i trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which i stood on as i got into bed staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning shows room had not been properly cleaned unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair room was tiny and not good value for money location for us was important main public areas high standard and parking a bonus parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items breakfast tea was not a brand to savour left it after a sip some guests had also left items uncovered e g cheese selection and flies were enjoying these there was a timid fox in the garden although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk mobile coverage seemed to be poor and wifi alleviated issues to some extent great location great amenities transport links rooms had all key requirements staff helpful nothing the bath was huge and the location was really good near the tube but outside the congestion zone with a good car parkno negative the location is great you can find all what you need int that area close to the u derground the hotel is nice clean with a friendly staff keys for the rooms and system of opening doors water in the shower kept changing temperatures constantly location size of room and comfort of bed the breads at breakfast were not as fresh as i thought they should be having said that the range of choice was excellentno positive i ordered aroom on the second or third floor and got on the ground also orderd an executive room and got standard no positive the bathroom was extremely small the room was lovely clean and the beds were very comfortable it was also great to have the garden difficult to find anything that we didn t like the location the outlook of the hotel friendliness of the staff we will returnno negative very clean comfy hotel good value at   a night in london great location for earls court royal albert hall and tube thin walls could hear the tv next door quite loudly but not enough to complain location was excellent as we re the staff we ordered a room for   adults the room was a   person room with a horribel extra bed not made for adults and caused painful nights no positive expense for meals the location and the easy travelling to where we needed to be as we were in london for a purpose not a holiday the staircase at the entrance inconvenience for the huge luggage n not suitable for elderly the breakfast is thumbs up with its variety n quality no negative the staff were efficient and friendly and the room was clean i chose the hotel based on its cleanliness rating and wasn t disappointed upgraded to executive king size room not an executive room in my opinion very basic appears to be more suited to business clients great location loved it all we enjoyed the little extras eg tissue box set in marble under the sink washing line discreetly fixed over bath etc breakfast not quite as good as it used to be it used to be what set this hotel apart from its competitors good attentive staff during previous stays it was nice to have a glass of champagne from the breakfast buffet we missed it this time good location and private parking wifi is as always in london bit of pain due to lower and unstable bitrate excellent staff and great welcome to the hotel after checkinno negative the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood very close to the earl s court tube station great breakfast very nice staff clean and comfotableno negative the k k hotel is always maintained and staffed to a high standard we ve been going back there for many years now and always enjoy our stay no negative all the staff where very friendly and helpful the food was excellent and a great choice the rooms where lovely as well no negative nice hotel with a wonderful backyard good location as it is close to subway in a residential area restaurants close by the matress is not very comfortable and the bathroom is small even i had a king executive room position of the hotel wifi and breakfastno negative responsive staff excellent room terrific breakfast and located conveniently to tube a bit pricey but service food and comfort all exceptional difficult to locate the phone to contact reception lack toilet itineraries and it was difficult to locate these they have followed through special requests comfortable bed wide choices for breakfast and very clean air con not great great location and very comfortable rooms room was available for early check in easy walk to attractions and trains for onward journey not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a   off voucher i would have been very annoyed if i had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal we had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable no parking on site we parked about     mile away but it s expensive parking from     friday until    am sunday cost     although reasonable by london standards it s an added expense for a weekend away perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks restaurant expensive given the quality of food standard rooms are very comfortable good central location no negative very large room hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful short walk to public transport blackfriars tube station and temple station we have been charged for room service that we did not have i spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of     issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed this has not been done location and room excellent it would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel guest svc manager francesco was very helpful with our questions on places to go and ways to get there room bed was extremely comfortable and good sized bathroom was also a good sized bathroom with a long bath and a cute apex duck a very cute and novel idea every thing was excellent apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at   am by staff walking in room when i mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered room was great bathroom was immaculately clean no problems at all room and bathroom excellent really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower tv ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room hotel looks new so all furnishings modern tube a short walk away we walked to the theatre district in around     minutes we did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by i would certainly recommend this hotel no negative staff really friendly bed was extremely comfy and not too far from two underground stations the concierge recommended a great italian on fleet street and booked a table for two in minutes overall great stay no negative we were very pleased with the hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors not a lot to put in this section if i was going to be very picky i d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad wine list could be improved room was clean and well appointed location was great for sight seeing being set back from the road our room was quiet a most enjoyable stay meals very plain no extras or garnishes restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable cold croissants for breakfast nice room modern and cool bar space in lobby very cosy no toothbrush provided being new in this area the conceierge service is excellent special thanks to mr francis who was on duty and helped my colleague and myself several times throughout our stay nothing brilliant location so close to the tube room was gorgeous and spacious lovely and modern the hotel was quiet and so so clean loved it really made our stay extra relaxing the shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra   pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and   bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area the wi fi was rather terrible my husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine and since i did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip i was relying on wi fi to communicate while in london thankfully there were other locations around the city where i could connect to the wi fi the location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the underground tube we also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district there were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice the staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly they also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them the only thing i d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows we were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite as part of that you get access to the club lounge the room was lovely looked as new comfy bed very clean and the club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available  hrs the staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation the view from the hotel was quite uninspiring easy to reach covent garden soho and city however the hotel is quite far away from westminster room is clean comfy and nicely designed very nice couch good bathno negative book a room that comes with access to the club lounge the club lounge offers a continental breakfast free water soda wine and beer throughout the day and sandwiches and fruit during the afternoon the coffee machine makes the best lattes along with a variety of other types of coffees and hot chocolate this lounge really made the stay for us breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary a la carte was also possible but we didn t try although it s a fairly big hotel the overall vibe we got was very cozy which we liked a lot staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we needed upon arrival we received a reduction coupon for the breakfast the location is exquisite more seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets very clean large rooms with high value toiletries extremely comfortable bed and pillows friendly staff no negative this is without question one of london finest hotels i have never slept that well in a very very longtime and i love the duck amazing reception and great facilities no negative great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody the cleaner knocked on our door at  am which wasn t ideal we were checking out that day so no need to clean the room being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic the room and bed were extremely comfortable excellent personalised service food was excellent this was my second time at this hotel the first time i booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room i was given this time i opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room i had stayed in before it just might be that i was given a free upgrade the first time no positive going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings they were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building the design facilities and location of the hotel wifi and also gym were quite convenient some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed very clean and lovely bathroom too a few more little milks maybe as i drink a lot of tea but i was given a little jug of milk when i asked the bathroom was light pleasant and very clean the wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities the bed was comfortable the air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive a lot better value for money in other hotels the room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious nothing your doing a fantastic job just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court where to start from the amazing upgrade for my husbands  th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start the hotel is in a great location less than   minutes walk to covent garden and for location alone is great value i had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner it s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the london eye the apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans pringles and of course the apex duck we had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay they really have thought about everything we have stayed in many hotels in london but would definately choose apex again the rooms were too dark and warm after shaving i got on a plane and realized i missed half my face the bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet the bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room it was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room the walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories one should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast the staff were from anywhere else but britain which did not help make our british experience any better it was located in a cosy corner off the street if we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different literally could not find fault with anything the staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely location was fine for where i needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and covent garden depends what you looking for underground is about   mins walk in either direction very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet i imagine very pleasant staff and good hotel bar i didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment at the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent we felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another   to price of our stay the location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket the room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive but understand i wasn t paying for a view the staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly the shower and bath were fantastic bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm good location to walk around london not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not eu compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little bose speaker have the old iphone   connector nice bathroom with big shower and bath quiet if you get a room on the top floors no negative i spend the weekend in the apex hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london for this thank you so much we will come back best regards theresa breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on fleet street rooms are quiet beds are huge bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful location is very good thames within walking distance temple area is beautiful note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud service also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you had my  th birthday while staying the hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits spent two thousand pounds on   rooms felt short changed comfortable room which was very clean my son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms he booked directly with apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that i paid booking via booking com cost me almost an extra   for breakfasts even after i had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison no positive everything was genuinely perfect everything from the reception greeting of luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception the cleaning staff were polite and warm my standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room nothing our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our green band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors very comfortable and clean room balcony was a little plus bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iphone   adapter advertised sky movies but was pin protected but i m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code alex hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a junior suite which was amazing free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh it took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room but that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional the room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything also had to love the apex duck would definately recommend staying in an apex hotel its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except one office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is minimalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there glad i just booked it for one night to try a new place since i am frequently traveling to london and was searching for a place closer to our office in fleetstreet location would have been great the breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at it would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway it caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers the food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this room was a nice size and very quiet quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there we were in room   which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing no negative the hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of london so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit we didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep there was very little traffic noise either it was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards the novello is a about   minutes walk away i loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home the room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean a bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast location of the hotelno negative really lovely and luxurious hotel special thanks to gosia on reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you gosia a couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans the room was really completely sound proof we appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes and if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack the superior rooms are equipped with a bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable room on small side for a king very expensive for the wednesday thursday nights first night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab third night managed to find   soft pillows bed comfortable not enough hangers in cupboards for   people staying more than   night room temperature control did not go lower than  c and seemed to revert to  c once room key taken out bar prices on the high side excellent location good standard of hotel professional service lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled jellybeans and pringles missing only one duck  people automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users didn t get the room i booked no positive the ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but i am aware i m fussy with my baths location was reason for booking and was spot on staff were all very pleasant time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains check out swift and easy no negative location of the hotel is fantastic the hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful the room was massive particularly considering its location in london the breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around london a bit mean with tea coffee milk in room great hotel in good location fairly near theatres st paul s tate modern the city river thames the shard half hour walk to trafalgar square a bit more to soho oxford st nice to walk along the river to westminster or get a boat    min taxi from st pancras fairly quiet district for london but not much happening in the immediate location tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience we got a room   with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony especially in summer you won t have much privacy location temple is very central but still i would chose another central location the next time i m in london as in the weekends temple seems a bit deserted room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need bed was very comfortable as well the surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road   the hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that i can understand but then the plug in the room should be closer to the mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord because i could not see myself in the mirror whilst i was drying my hair so basically the hotel has have   options larger hair dryer electric cord electric plug closer to the mirror mirror on both sides of the tv   another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night i guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced the bed really confortable location is good walking distance to tube and train can t think of anything that could have been improved room was gorgeous and very clean lovely big bed high quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go location and price so close to christmas was awesome room upgrade on arrival was much appreciated after a long and difficult flight staff very welcoming and attentive helped us with our bags and shopping when we checked in and out were on hand to order taxis and help it was also quiet and out of the way despite the central location sorry can t think of any negative thing it is tucked away but near to public transport the staff were friendly efficient and helpful their restaurant had a great selection at reasonable prices beds comfortable very clean and we had a lovely walk in shower how hasn t this place got a extra star it should be five star not four what didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful we loved everything at the apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly the food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room the nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages and the elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch elemis is a amazing brand to use really we could find fault with nothing the location so close to the centre but beautifully quiet the efficiency of the whole operation including breakfast which is often the weak link in hotels the stylish decor within an old style exterior the basin doesn t seem to be clean enough it s difficult to drain waters down the basin location close to city center big ben and river thames   minutes walk to temple station bed is comfortable the shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty the location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite the staff was more than helpful could have had a few more different tea bags in room room and bathroom very clean room quite spaciious for london comfortable king size bed in a quiet square away from the noise of traffic nice to have tea making facilities in room as always the price of breakfast is far too expensive there are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices the location of the hotel is perfect it s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to temple or blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield the superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking there are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa the room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep the staff are very attentive polite and helpful we heard our neighbors bathroom in the night we arived the hotel late in the night and the staff service was exelent without extra charge upgraded our room the ducks idea is unique and fun in the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk i didn t know what happened the air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature the room is spacious and clean amenities are all prepared which is very helpful the staff are very kind hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help clean comfy and a great location for us no negative location was very central but rooms very quiet reception very friendly efficient and helpful bags were taken to rooms discounted breakfast offered in addition to room only we had booked facilities described map of london given and named member of staff provided as contact during our stay over the weekend bar staff and housekeeping staff were equally good excellent personal service our best hotel stay in london for a decade all is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower likewise bedroom was not clean nothing i do not recommend this hotel to tourists the manager does not care about you and they do not try to deal with your problems we didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away very quiet location considering so close to fleet street comfortable bed the rooms and corridors were much to hot however i was able to lower the temperature in the room there is absolutely nothing else to complain about a lovely hotel i liked the green elephant outside the condition of the room after it was cleaned was exceptional the bathroom was stunning having a free bottle of still and sparkling water every day was brilliant there was an ironing board kettle hairdryer safe fridge free wifi i was very comfortable the whole stay it was also very quiet food in the restaurant was   star there wasn t a full length mirror in the room we were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup love elemis toiletries modern bathroom and clean liked that the shower was separate to the bath beds comfy overall very pleased unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for     hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available i did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free room and comfy bed wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok very dark and quiet room perfect for sleep big and nice bathroom i realise that good accommodation is expensive in central london but neverthelessi feel this hotel is somewhat costly we were on a room only rate so i cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel the location is unbeatable both from the point of view of access to all the sites and attractions of central london but also the area where the hotel is located is very attractive the hotel is quite the staff were very friendly facilities in the bedroom and bathroom were first class just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day maybe need to book very early to get a good deal great sized room and bathroom with separate bath very comfortable bed and nice touch of some free jelly beans we didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered service was very slow one hour and a half for   burger   risotto and   pies room was excellent bed very comfy and quiet staff were great especially leandro who was working in the bar on sa i can t think of anything that could have been improved staff were extremely friendly and efficient i mentioned that we were taking the trip to celebrate my husband s birthday so staff arranged for chocolates to be left in the room which was a lovely surprise breakfast really good too all minor issues the location of the room was good however i did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room when we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal there was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time one opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping the location of the hotel is great room and bed were comfortable and clean we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time however we were able to get an early check in with no problems would definitely stay there again the food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available we had to venture out to eat instead stylish hotel in a great location for exploring london rooms very well appointed and comfortable really enjoyed our stay here several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips enjoyed use of club lounge perfect for continental breakfast hotel not too big situation great for visiting many tourist sights would stay again the smart tv wasn t connected to the internet so i couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart tv also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else the bed was extremely comfortably and the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it no negative they were more than accommodating with allowing early check in and complementary late check out would really recommend the apex group of hotels for your business or leisure travels really couldn t fault it a lovely luxury yet highly friendly hotel that will put a big smile on your face as soon as you walk past the elephant we brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated lovely room and access to the club lounge was great no negative great location with easy access to the underground fabulous breakfast with hot foods selections comfy and cozy bed all staff were very welcoming as always room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty my in room breakfast pancakes went so hard i couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot location was great we walked there from victoria and very close to covent garden decor quite lovely beds and pillows very comfy showers spacious baths deep good amount of storage and in room facilities in room breakfast was promptly delivered and beautifully presented was not told about the   extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days this needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive location and staff were excellent arrived early and was aloud to check in with no problems while some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g jesus other staff were just rude to the level that i will not recommend this hotel to any of my network great location very clean and comfortable no negative the busstop at fleetstreet one step away from the hotel furthermore a lot of restaurants and theatres at walking distance the hotel is nice modern clean and quiet we chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and london has so much more to offer when it comes to food pillows were too chunky room was spacious as was the bathroom with lovely complimentary toiletries beds were extremely comfy check in and out was a breeze and staff were attentive great cocktails in the bar all good the room was good size very clean and comfortable good menu at reasonable prices best to get room with club access for a little more money as you will save this on breakfast alone i didn t understand the continental breakfast setup my room didn t include breakfast a weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing   pounds no positive no full length mirror in bedrooms breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking really great reception staff fantastic suzed rooms amazing location great food being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror the bed was really comfortable we had a quiet room with dual aspect windows and a lovely view of the london eye and the shard the bathroom with separate shower and bath tub the helpful attitude of staff room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to   degrees very nice hotel immaculate excellent location good size room would definitely stay again i bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the   service charge they were not happy when i queried it and asked for the money back light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced good sized rooms and well fitted out very helpful concierge and reception desk staff maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them excellent bedding mattress and pillows room large and very quiet in the upper floors as requested staff extremely service minded and helpful wonderful location we took the tube from st pancras int l to temple when arriving however we discovered afterwards that the double decker bus   stops a few meters from the hotel and goes to the strand trafalgar piccadilly oxford circus etc i e ideal for shopping theatres and activities it was also very easy to go back to st pancras walking north on fetter lane to holborn then taking bus   to king s cross next to st pancras int l no negative we were given a complimentary upgrade to the top floor by a very friendly lady who checked us in all the staff we encountered were courteous welcoming i would definitely stay here again also a perfect location in an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a   minute walk away the hotel was luxurious with large comfortable beds and good pillows as it was away from the main tourist areas it was quiet at night so good for sleeping the breakfast was varied and very tasty with the hot breakfast made to order from the menu it was possible to walk into covent garden within     minutes which meant many attractions and restaurants were easily reachable an excellent base for a good week stay with interconnecting rooms for the family we were put in a disabled room so no bath as we were up for a function in middle temple hall location could not have been better very comfortable room and very obliging staffno negative an excellent location for london sights and theatre district the staff were very friendly and accommodating super breakfast and a well stocked bar check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and i will have to have room with two singles disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone ac unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally bose docking station only suitable for iphone   do those still exist there was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat at this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience no positive my room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds great location good size room for london with very friendly and helpful staff the heating was turned to   degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm i left a jacket and suit bag behind and francesco was super helpful in tracking it down great bathroom and good pillows there was no bubble bath over all the satyr was great the staff were most help full bed was comfy bath was hugh took care of my every need and made myself and my partner most welcome room facing a wall this hotel is located on the western edge of the city in the walking distance from all the west end attractions in a quiet courtyard next to the temple inn of court the room was spacious and well equipped i was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description the view offices   meter from my window the price of room service the location the friendly staff the comfort and cleanliness of the room the bathroom the hotel s design the inner court and the lovely bar area need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but i find that problem during most of my stays in hotels the room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner i didn t make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump the bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and i also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon i passed this view on to the chef because i think in england were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often the whole room was nicely decorated nothing the appearance of the hotel was beautiful and every single member of staff was delightful hotel bar was very relaxing and our room size was perfect was difficult to see from afar where hotel is had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place the hotel was lush beds were extremely comfy very clean too staff were great always willing to help in the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all when we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the apex hotels fault may i add advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the apex the concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault the hotel was a   minute walk from blackfriars station beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance on arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade rooms were fantastic with everything you need ideal for our romantic weekend away bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs they had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in london without our case having to come with us also a   minute walk from covent garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t no negative staffs are very kind and friendly i ve stayed at apex before when i checked in a staff told me welcome back i was really happy for such a friendly atmosphere thank you so much room isn t as photo shows in booking we booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size  m  with sofa we were given a room on   floor the room was small abt    m  only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space room is very clean good facilities one staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo id was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day great location comfortable clean room with all facilities we needed staff generally helpful the ac couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down about     of the tv channels didn t work due to weak signal only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms there are other lifts but they re staff only great location the rooms and bathrooms are very well laid out with plenty of storage elemis products shampoo conditioner bath gel and lotion lovely coffee and tea service includes milk chocolate and different types of sugar plenty of outlets clever desk vanity set up is a perfect area to dry hair makeup the bench at the end of the bed is also very handy nothing the hotel is well located and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff they are so helpful and very attentive i cannot speak highly enough of the staff they help to make it a great hotel in london no negative our room was lovely and modern with everything you could need the club lounge was a lovely peaceful space to have breakfast in and then later relax in and have a refreshment after a busy day sightseeing there really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel i couldn t fault this hotel it more than met my expectations in the d cor size of room position and helpfulness of staff regular customer of apex city of london hotel they didn t know i was a returning customer upon arrival breakfast should have been included for over   for a room super comfy bed beautiful courtyard towards the rear the room that i was given is smaller than what was shown when i reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one the room view was to corporate offices so i couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode good location and decent style and atmosphere no negative the hotel is well located in the legal district of london and within walking distance of major city landmarks such as st paul s cathedral theatres and trafalgar square staff were friendly and helpful the room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature reception staff were excellent gym was well equipped for the size the restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free hotel is in a good position although tucked away from the main road our room was very clean and the bed comfortable the iron and ironing board came in handy as we were going to a weddingno negative loved the courtyard nice place to unwind after sightseeing lots of attention to comfort and details in our room towel warmer wash cloths usb ports lovely bedding cute rubber duckie cozy and comfortable public areas no negative wonderful pillows seriously it s been over   years since my last trip to london my impression is that london has become a more friendly city and this extends to all the staff at apex temple who were courteous and helpful to us staff wasn t super friendly doorman was impatient and bordering on rude modern and well appointed nice shower bathrobes slippers in room ironing board and adapters if you forget one no decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room friendly and helpful staff location in easy walking distance of theatres shops and river hotel was quiet although on a busy street seemed very matter of fact at reception lacked warmth didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine beautiful elemis bath products supplied location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep really comfortable rooms nice friendly staff lovely courtyard to have drinks etc oddly i was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile great value excellent location and a good breakfast nothing we loved the style and comfort of our room and of the hotel in general it s location was perfect right in the heart of the city with all its hustle and bustle yet very restful and quiet the staff were excellent and the service superb nothing location was great walking distance to lots of attractions hotel itself was immaculate comfy beds spotless bathroom with elemis toiletries couldn t fault anything it was an excellent hotel all round nothing to complain about the rooms were very comfortable with beautiful modern decor great lighting robes iron drinks and a cracking bed the hotel is set back slightly from fleet st in its own courtyard and it has a modern bar and a well appointed gym the staff were excellent as was the breakfast we had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit have stayed here before and love this hotel for the location it s a min taxi from st pancras close to trafalgar sq somerset house the river tate modern st paul s the oldest pub in london many theatres the rooms are very well appointed and the friendly courteous staff make this a special place to stay there is also a very nice tapas bar next door the noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed the nice rooms tv fast wireless the great bathroom breakfast was chaotic slow and had to keep on asking for missing items definitely the b team on that day was better in previous stay very well appointed hotel with friendly efficient reception staff overall good experience set back off fleet street so no traffic noise the really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening lovely hotel with super clean rooms efficient staff and all that you may need for a comfortable and pleasant stay the room was of a fair size with comfortable bed the only drawback was no possibility of opening the window but this is a minor thing as most people prefer the air conditioning anyway overall a great place booked a room for   and were told it would be a sofa bed didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable no sleep in preparation for a long drive home also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up a bit disappointing after a long day staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck enjoyed it all fabulous bed and bathroom extra big great for getting ready for an occasion it was like a little oasis of quiet set away from all the noise will stay again only   small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks pringles and jelly beans during our   night stay excellent location beds very comfy breakfast good when we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one actually this was not a problem i prefer to have more empty space also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since i am travelling very often to london it will be a problem for me during winter months the hotel is great the staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that i will visit the hotel again the room superior double  th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops very clean good sleep and i liked it aesthetically it has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel i would definitely recommend it none breakfast really gave a good start of the day also the rooms were clean and the beds were super comfy this hotel is stroll recommend for people who d like to stay in a quite and relaxing atmosphere and still be in the heart of everything staff in reception not helpful nore friendly besides we had to wait   minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar poor service compared to the hotel ranking excellent location great bedroom especially the bed nothing to improve wish i could ve stayed longer the room was really large by london standards well planned out great modern decor a balcony to sit outside on nespresso machine elemis toiletries friendly helpful staff very clean good location right on fleet st would stay again we chose this expensive hotel because the photos on booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over london and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal when we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same the restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor the photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food we were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading we were mother and daughter away for a few days in london the room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring nothing the apex temple court hotel is a beautiful facility that is very well located in central london you are a few minutes walk from major destinations the staff is extremely friendly very helpful and very knowldegeable rooms are outstanding and the wifi is goodnall throughout the facility i definitely recommend the stay there for both business and leisure the coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context this hotel offers a great value in a good location the staff was marvelous and helpful to a fault no negative on arrival the receptionist was extremely helpful she gave us a map advised us on the quickest way to get to our destination and as we were leaving she called us a taxi the bar staff were very friendly to overall lovely stay staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception i also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room i spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number once i called reception they said they would called in house service but i still didn t receive the cup perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty p also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance in summary great stay and i would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way rooms were clean and beautiful and loved the bathroom with the free standing bath area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only     mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception very modern comfy rooms very clean lovely staff good wifi ok location good breakfast not included with room price located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants limited view friendly staff willing to help modern rooms and very comfortable close to some old historic pubs frequented by locals rather than tourists can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything the friendly knowledgable staff couldn t do enough for us they made us feel so very welcome the room was excellent from the facilities to the cleanliness and the bed was fantastic very poor front desk service the morning we left we did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport i attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in london we ended up with a taxi that took     hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about   if you re not from london be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on saturday we walked to covent garden for pretty much everything beautiful hotel everything was very clean bed was very comfortable drinks at the bar were great and staff there was pleasant no negative excellent bedroom very large by london standards overlooking the courtyard pleasant staff good location for all the sights you can walk to st pauls and the thames quite easily nice area at night for atmospheric old style fleet street pubs can t find fault with anything loved it everything room with balcony was fantastic very helpful staff central for everything concierge was so helpful when we realised we had left clothing behind it was posted the very next da highly recommend this hotel it s fantastic room was not ready for us to check in the front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal no sense of personal individualised service comfortable bed good location lovely housekeeping staff access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience amazing service great staff the rooms were great and all of my requests were met and exceeded deco is beautiful and location extremely convenient i appreciated the peace and quiet of the location accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in   days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in i had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude spacious rooms housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain the staff very friendly yet professional just a really good hotel and don t forget the duck milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu very comfortable bed quiet room as requested polite and efficient staff as above croissants not flakey enough dining room chairs need tips v noisy when moved bed lovely quietness great all staff v pleasant and helpful two adjacent rooms were requested upon arrival only one was ready comfortable and modern hotel rooms were quiet with large bathroom friendly staff room looked over by office block strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room staff gave us another room without hesitation beds so comfortable and clean staff very helpful location for me but it is still very central hotels in london are always very low quality this one really manages to come in a different higher standard no negative great staff my arrival was very delayed they were waiting and ready for me at  am with an upgraded room ideal location close to covent garden underground etc a bit mean with tea coffee milk etc the only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening very nice hotel in a convenient fairly quiet for london location staff were friendly rooms were a good size comfortable clean nothing the bed and pillows were so comfy i could have taken them home everything was great and especially as it had not been recommended and just picked out of a few looked at on line we were just so pleased and would definitely return bar and food prices but then it is london and the whole city is a rip off close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good although on fleet street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise the bed was probably the best i have ever slept in no negative lovely hotel fantastic location for us excellent customer service at reception i had forgotten to print off concert tickets lovely receptionist went out of her way to help me print them it would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff the very helpful and friendly staff especially cesar in the restaurant and wilfredo always cheerful and ready to help in any way first class facilities and decor you even had good weather for us very considerate please email our invoice thanks the lighting was pretty dark room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp everything was amazing we were very happy and pleased and would definitely go back again also we arrived at    am due to delayed flights all day and the apex staff at the concierge gave us a later check out time entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps as it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps room was well equipped and comfortable decor was modern and attractive location on fleet street near theatreland is good they gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected view on a wracked street corner so i felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price no positive details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out room was quiet and comfortable nice to have ipod speakers nothing could be better everything was excellent beautiful building very friendly staff and the elephant was lovely room was very nice bed so comfortable and big decor very niceno negative everything was perfect and more rooms very good quality fittings beautiful comfortable beds and pillows friendly staff nothing was too much trouble excellent choice of breckfast skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray no opening window bit pricey compared with other similar london stays large comfy bed large walk in shower huge mirror nothing at all the room was lovely extremely spacious and with a balcony the club lounge was a great touch well stocked with food and drinks all the staff were very helpful and keen to make sure everything was to our liking we had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working excellent location beautiful hotel great breakfast no negative we loved everything about staying at apex temple court hotel the staff was nice perfect located the room was big bright and clean bed and pillows very comfortable and furnishing were modern the club lounge was the best we will definitely stay there next time we go to london nothing to complain about here rooms are spacious and a large bathroom with separate full size bath and shower area added to the overall relaxation experience cannot think of anything all the staff to a man woman they were polite and helpful to such an extent that i telephoned the general manager on my return home to congratulate him on the quality of his people the food was good too my self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration on arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this she then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports she then asked how long we have been in the country very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend we have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review regards mr surj dhami no positive the place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort by the end of the trip i found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful the room was ridiculously dark it was a big room but with one small window for that reason alone i would never stay there again the air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference almost every night i was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed the staff did not say hello to me once and i was there for five nights the cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility but it was then suggested to me that i had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue not to be repeated i did not like very much the location was good there was a good shower that is about it no negative room was lovely spacious and luxurious excellent bathroom one of the comfiest beds we ve slept in location is quiet and yet so convenient we walked to drury lane very easily and quickly and it s on a bus route from paddington so we had a leisurely scenic journey back to our train kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry try loch fyne kippers best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard reception staff incredibly attentive helpful and approachable only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in london not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day i had to work i loved the pillows and the bed was super comfortable where can i buy those pillows the new interiors were bar prices but that s london for you i have been stopping here on and off for the past couple of years faultless and extremely pleasant stay within easy reach of all the main tourist hot spots would definitely recommend if on a weekend break no negative very clean rooms nice location entrance is on the main street and the bus station is just  meters away bus no   takes you to picadilly circus and oxford circus very nice lobby good mojito rooms are cozy modern and quiet robes and slippers are included we didn t have breakfast included in our price as we wanted to eat out all the time but the food in the lobby along with our drinks was great can t really think of anything location is great for covent garden and central london very friendly and helpful staff room was extremely clean and comfortable for where it is its great value there was even a charger lead in the room for my fone no negative from arrival staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was excellent our room was first class spacious well appointed and with a good view for   days straight i found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag the room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services location is great close to the city and you can take bus to everywhere as the bus stop is very close to the hotel laundry dry cleaning rates whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high well trained knowledgeable approachable and friendly staff nothing from the moment we arrived and checked in early the staff were great the room was fantastic with a great view of the london eye and big ben sky sports in the room is always a massive plus being an avid golfer the breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for   people for under the cost of   person at the hotel the location was perfect we stayed on a saturday and it was quiet but lovely the rooms were big lovely walk in shower clean no noise from other rooms staff all very friendly and helpful too little wardrobe space no chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers lighting in the bathroom could have been better no where to put toiletries in the shower breakfast was very good with a great choice the bed was so good we didn t want to get up location superb for both the city and the west end staff were very friendly and accommodating absolutely nothing staff always had time for us and when they printed out tickets for the tower of london for us gave us great advice to visit the crown jewels straight away as the queues build up later this proved to be the case expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage great connection to public transport polite service did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities considerate helpful and friendly staff lovely room value for money apex the duck gift in bathroom no negative had amazing service free upgrade and when my husbands flight delay nearly interfered with our trip they allowed an early check for free and tried their best help faultless service no fox news or cnbc on tv these are important channels for us visitors big selection of international channels from other countries wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience great staff love the location there was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast this is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all amazing hotel excellently appointed great location quiet comfortable rooms and very good value for money compared to similar price points black pudding on the breakfast was delicious the breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there we went for my husband s  th birthday the manager kindly arranged for a complimentary birthday card and beautifully wrapped box of chocolates to be left in the room for a fee they sprinkled rose petals from the door to the bed where they put the petals in the shape of a heart there were more around the bath too a lovely extra touch we were given a free upgrade too without even asking the staff couldn t do enough to help they even gave us a second free duck as we said we had two children the room was really clean and modern bed extra comfy shower fantastic the details of elemis toiletries and free jelly beans and pringles were an excellent bonus i cannot fault it and would definitely stay again location is excellent close to blackfriars tube station excellent excellent excellent no negative quiet yet very handy location for a number of london theatres including the savoy although we didn t use the bar it looked very inviting with the option to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine we asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so i called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away   weeks later still nothing at all i think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill the bed was comfy and the bath tube so nice i sleep warm and i couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor large room for london for sure and it s well located in the city the staff was attentive all good room was very comfortable and well appointed attention to detail was obvious customer service in all areas was excellent location was central to city attractions and entertainment there wasn t anything we didn t like the location is amazing rooms are spacious have everything you d need both rooms and public spaces are clean stylish i stayed on a sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week excellent staff high quality room and furnishings and a good breakfast i couldn t fault it at all lovely clean hotel in a great location staff were very friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we had the best possible stay the room was immaculate and well equipped there was nothing to fault the generously sized bathroom had a lovely bath and separate big shower cubicle everything was high quality and the room beautifully appointed very comfortable bed and large not at all noisy considering the location even with the window open plenty of eating places nearby and easy to find on foot no negative absolutely brilliant hotel me and my fiancee booked   nights stay for our anniversary to watch lion king we were upgraded as soon as we arrived great hotel tucked away would   recommend to anyone the only down point i have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high i understand the weekend we visited london was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures the room was refreshed everyday from check in to check out the hotel staff were constantly professional and always helpful nothing seemed too much to ask i found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great everything was amazing the decoration the room the bed the staff we are very happy to have found this hotel and we will recommend it to all of our friends limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening lovely room and good food service and staff excellent breakfast was lovely and waiting time at reception short benefits of a smaller and more intimate hotel nothing everything was spot on i stayed here with my daughter for a bank holiday treat excellent service from all staff and delicious food served in the room after a long day out and about very good location for theatres and covent garden faultless our second visit to this hotel we wouldn t stay anywhere else in london breakfast was very expensive location is good about   mins walk to the tube but also close to st pauls cathedral and the river room was very clean and the bathrooms was very nice am struggling to think of any negatives in fact i cannot think of any at all the room was of excellent quality and the bed was so comfortable i could stay there again for this reason alone wifi being free and of good quality was important for someone like myself roaming with my mobile network staff were extremely friendly and professional i would recommend this hotel to everyone possible bar prices a little steep excellent rooms and it is either a new hotel or recently refurbished we only had the basic room which was very comfortable with a very good en suite great location only   mins walk to trafalgar square lunch was very good but only ate at hotel once staff very helpful and pleasant lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel which was lovely in the spring sunshine you would not have known that it is located in the centre of london good gym as well which i didn t use tube station only   minutes walk away and hotel surrounded by good restaurants and bars breakfast prices might be reduced location fleet street central great staff perfect for sights theatre room facilities gowns coffee iron satellite tv bath and shower comfortable bed quiet when staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the club lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade i thought this was a bit mean spirited also we were awoken at    am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them it was our  th wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room chocolates in the room and a free drink at the bar lovely welcome touch the location is superb none the location was so convenient and it s quite we were upgraded to a lovely clean spacious room with a very comfy bed and pillows the staff were all friendly and professional from the reception raquel and clara concierge wilfredo and restaurant staff especially lina we can highly recommend apex temple hotel the wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain it wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night we paid for an upgrade to our room and liked it very much the bed was comfortable the room well appointed and most of all it was lovely and quiet the hotel was fine though we did little in it except sleep and have breakfast the latter was fine the location of the hotel is convenient for fleet st and neighbouring areas no negative everything you need to make a short break easy a decent hair dryer an iron that gets hot and you don t have to wait an hour for the bath to fill simple things that many london hotels still cannot provide in   cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in and very comfortable almost   star nothing great location check in staff and concierge were so polite and helpful we felt nothing was too much trouble and very genuine the room was spotless and facilities excellent a very quiet room and bed was extremely comfortable which meant we slept very well wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all relaxing ambience quiet location great breakfast excellent service from all of the staff no complaints the whole stay at this hotel was more than perfect location close to the bus station n front of the main entrance in fact and metro     min of walk personnel helpful kind quick reacting to the complaints clean proper rooms in the room there is complimentary cookies tea coffee someone was complaining of not enough of milk i don t think that people should expect a bottle of milk for free in a room it s ridiculous especially if you will mention on a reception or to passing made that you would like to have a little more of mono dose milk they would kindly give it to you wi fi is good bed is large and super comfortable conditioner in the room bath and shower in a bathroom and super cute duck bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper upgraded when we arrived to a lovely spacious room overlooking the square reception staff were plentiful and well informed was approx   minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between temple and black friars stations could just be me being lazy though room was lovely view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms one had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else very clean helpful and polite staff nice rooms generally n a hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all we were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely loved the apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website no negative the superior room was very comfortable the location of the hotel along fleet street was a comfortable walking distance to covent garden if you chose not to walk there are buses just outside the hotel that takes you to there or to trafalgar square over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged this time i was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com i will be coming back every time when i m able to secure such price breakfast is disappointing clean hotel nice quiet location very helpful and supportive staff especially at the reception will be coming back as frequent traveler to london on business purposes provided that price is reasonable no negative nice modern clean decor great location close to tube and taxis many restaurants or coffee places during the week quite dead in the weekend close to theatre area trafalgar square etc absolutely nothing everything fantastic stay at the hotel enjoyed a lovely nights sleep and quiet attention to detail superb i am a coffee fan and was pleased too see the kettle in the room was spotless inside not all full of limescale and quality filter coffee bags on the coffee tray which were really appreciated and coincidentaly my favourite type really impressed with every aspect of this hotel and will definately returnno negative the staff were fantastic we requested an ice bucket and it was at the room almost straight away the gentleman who checked us in remembered my name our bathroom had the most amazing bath and overall we felt we got upgraded booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price conflicting information from the staff very comfortable bed and spacious en suite very enjoyable stay food drink was delicious but a little pricey stunning hotel superb location luxurious rooms waking up to views of the london eye the shard big ben was a really bonus there is absolutely nothing that we didn t like stayed here a year ago and if anything standards are even higher than before friendly efficient staff spacious comfortable well equipped room spotlessly clean in a peaceful central location no negative the room was beautifully furnished and the walk in shower and spacious bathtub was superb the staff were fantastic very helpful and friendly location was very convenient for covent garden s shops bars and restaurants would definitely recommend the breakfast is expensive the size of room large and cosy very comfy bed being able to open the windows great shower fluffy big towels bath sheets coffee facilities in room quiet room no housekeeping knocking on door at  am room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con wifi is not super speed as stated in fact i couldn t log on at all for our two night stay very peaceful and quiet would not believe you were so close to the main roads staff extremely friendly helpful everything was spotless and clean rubber duck is a great gimmick children loved taking him on our travels and taking pictures an extra   charge i m still to work out for what the additonal   wasn t on my receipt at checkout would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the   mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout the view was very good big ben chard houses of parliment complimentary  hr late checkout my one experience in the dining room was not great i ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian quiet location in a courtyard off fleet street spacious room with shower and full bathtub extra comfortable and luxurious bedding friendly staff lively bar near the lobby fifteen minutes walk from three different tube lines fast reliable internet complimentary bottled water replenished each day all night menu could have had better quality choices arrived late and had dinner and drinks at the lively bar lounge area great room with stellar bathroom and toiletries the free coffee and hot cocoa in the room was replenished daily with a few complementary cookies as well fast free wifi loved the stay no negative we stayed at the apex after a conference i had in london last week the staff at the front desk and the lounge were extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very modern very clean and very quiet we had a very comfortable stay and will definitely be looking to return to the apex should our travels take us back to london in the near future would have liked an easter duck to go with our christmas duck parking is quite a distance from the hotel however very good rate would be nice to have the option of valet parking staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble rooms have everything you need very clean and comfortable very quiet love the ducks second stay at this hotel last was at christmas stayed in the same room comfortable walking distance to st paul s south bank and covent garden to name but a few will definitely stay again breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which i prefer but that s the only minimal thing i could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly amazing room had a great bathroom staff were friendly and very helpful room service was amazing and to channels too best hotel i ve stayed in nothing could be improved our stay was excellent the hotel location the room and staff were all excellent the cleanliness and standard of the fixtures and fittings in the room hotel generally was excellent breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful lovely building tucked away nice quiet location but not far from theaters restaurants etc door staff welcoming and friendly there is nothing i would criticise the hotel for it s a really good hotel in the city extremely comfortable and quiet considering the location this was my second time staying and i d have no hesitation returning in future the only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with london we found it quite difficult to find other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better the room was amazing it was very spacious and immaculate upon arrival the staff were very friendly and showed us where to go and advised on optional extras we thoroughly enjoyed our stay no negative staff extremely welcoming friendly room service was extremely quick generally the hotel maintains high standards very pleased with this booking overall will definitely return nothing of note everything was perfect well ok the phone in room   didn t work friendly staff very professional and a great central location room backed into another building and thoroughfare lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed the bed was especially comfy and the room was very quiet great nights sleep elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed lovely hotel very comfortable particularly loved the approach in the evening with the lighting red carpet and lovely elephant breakfast good with plenty of choice for every taste extremely good value we thought all staff were lovely courtyard view splendid the bin men came a little later on a sunday morning but hey we were in central london its noisier in   hotels certainly not the hotels fault comfortable bed with lovely duvets and pillows simply furnished but totally practical very amenable staff   hour bar service would be good but i can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay lovely clean room good shower modern accommodation staff were all very helpful and friendly lovely bar area we were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay it would be nice if it was a bit cheaper staff were friendly our room was ready when we arrived at     pm they changed our room from a double to a twin in room dining was superb food was fab there is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside there has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers everything was great the service the rooms location no negative classy tasteful d cor great location courteous staff and some nice little touches in the rooms that made it feel special nice place for a romantic getaway room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice comfortable spacious room cleanliness overall lovely shower did not take breakfast but expensive bed and bedding and from fittings top quality state of decoration excellent clean paintwork tiling etc in bathroom tranquil obliging checkin and concierge service nothing hi standard of accomdation staff were very attentive and good attention to detail with luxury extras provided only a   min walk to covent garden very near to the royal courts of justice somerset house and the strand too hot everywhere air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at   degrees but it seemed to jump back to   everything breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere the room was spotless was in a very quiet location even though off of fleet street only   mins walk to covent garden theatres very luxurious room with huge king bed enormous pillows beautiful too expensive for me most of the time i love this place the only hotel i have found in this part of london where i am treated as an individual amazing friendly service you feel you could ask what you want and the staff would try and help there was nothing not to like the rooms were excellent the beds were super comfy overall this is a really lovely hotel one i am definitely staying in again no negative the location of the hotel is brilliant for all the main sights of london rooms were spacious and clean bed comfy a taxi was booked for us no problem decent price considering it s central london will definitely book again receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however i would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives bar and bar staff lovely great cocktails room huge for a london hotel and great value facilities brilliant tea and coffee facilities were good but not excellent these places never leave enough milk in the rooms this is the worst thing i can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad everything beautiful building lovely rooms great staff and a fantastic price no negative polite helpful staff immaculate rooms and fantastic location views of houses of parliament and millennium eye from our window would definitely stay there again would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views good standard luxuary hotel with covent garden leicester square thames and theatres in walking distance nothing we loved our stay we got a room upgrade at a very cheap price the facilities were great location central and the staff were helpful and friendly wish we could have stayed longer shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night fantastic hotel with great staff and facilities nothing was too much trouble and the room was exactly as we expected also loved the fact we could take the rubber duck away which also helps promote the hotel very clever marketing i would of loved to of stayed another night or two everything was perfect just what i was looking for the room was magnificent the staff were very friendly and helpful it was a nice relaxing stay the breakfast the next day was delicious really filled us up for the day ahead we had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles we didn t get any and over   for   beers it would have been appreciated clean comfortable room excellent bed and pillows excellent breakfast very quiet in a busy city there was no table and chairs on the balcony and only   plastic chair in the corner of balcony in a double room you d expect there to be   the room was big and spacious and the bed was soooooo comfy beautiful bathroom and shower and breakfast was amazing not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues great location away from busy tourist areas but easy and quick access to west end exmouth market where we went to eat on one night could walk easily to convent garden and soho and lots of buses to points beyond very friendly staff excellent martinis at the bar rooms clean spacious comfortable only a one night stay just a one night stay to see a musical at the aldwych theatre the hotel is ideally situated for theatres numerous london attractions underground stations and the thames the staff were superb we will go again the room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character it felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure it was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities the view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall it made the room very dark however not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable in this instance i was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff beautiful building courtyard was stunning marvellous location just a short walk from temple tubestation along the thames very pretty the staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday they delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special the lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it the design of the space left a long lasting impression the rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee the maid coming into my room on both mornings at   when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy room was clean and tidy with lots of room and a comfortable bed no negative from the moment we walked in to the moment we left we couldn t fault the staff hotel or facilities best hotel we have ever stayed at in london will definitely return room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room the room was lovely staff were brilliant too very helpful offering maps and recommendations breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when i complained not easy to get to by tube great rooms friendly helpful staff no negative nothing to fault with this hotel everything was perfect from start to finish we were also upgraded to a superior room and a surprise birthday cake in the room the staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were immaculate will recommend to everyone and look forward to returning in the summer pillows to soft and room service to keen woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning lovely decor friendly staff good location but it is about a   minute walk to a tube station brilliant facilities large bath and walk in shower the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet when we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on the personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet breakfast was good and worth the money personnel gave us   discount every morning nothing everyone friendly tried hard to acknowledge my mums birthday and upgraded our rooms excellent location and would recommend the hotel to anyone we paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify   it was the only bar part of the break room was amazing and the bed was awesome the executive lounge was a let down and i would not pay the extra to access this facility again the rooms were excellent and the staff were very helpful no negative very nice location within walking distance of all the main attractions and theatres the view from our window was the icing on the cake overlooking the london eye and the houses of parliament the staff were extremely friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble the only thing was that i had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with   candles a   and a   and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel i was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles a bit dissapointed there cause i would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise it was an amazing weekend i had planned a birthday surprise for my partner but the staff at the apex took it further surprising both of us at the end nothing this was our fourth stay here never regret staying here excellent hotel nice rooms great location for westend theatres very helpful and friendly staff quiet and bonus views over london they forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon even then they failed to clear a drinks tray friendly mostly efficient but unobtrusive staff comfortable clean quiet and convenient the club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water great location great friendly and efficient staff i still found the hotel a little on the expensive side also not a big thing but if you re going to have a bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded ipods iphones well located and very comfortable if not remarkable rooms no negative staff were very friendly welcoming was pleasant and all of my needs were met room was spotless very comfortable bed and large bathroom with shower and bath great views from the room and was extremely quiet would recommend high floor for good views of london eye big ben and shard would recommend to anyone and will be returning shortly perfect bathroom too cold and not heated towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted also a little surprised by the club room no snacking possibilities no english beer great bed room design nice the price is steep it is quite luxurious but maybe not   a night luxurious fantastic location phenomenal staff gorgeous room it was a very luxurious stay i almost didn t want to leave the room i walked everywhere the hotel is in the middle of it all no negative the staff at reception were incredibly helpful the room was very comfortable with a great sized bathroom with bath tub this was the first stop in a month long trip and it was a great way to start very central location and within easy walking distance to all attractions we have already recommended the hotel to several people in the uk europe not a single thing the location is excellent midway between the west end and st paul s the hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto fleet st and the hustle and bustle of the city of london staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful no negative the customer service standard of accommodation quality of design and fixtures staff were excellent cannot wait to come back breakfast was excellent selection at breakfast was very good our room   was stunning breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price they also added     service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty great location and lovely breakfast selection lovely clean room with large comfortable bed nice and quiet and amazing shower and bath no negative reception well staffed by cheerful and very helpful team cleaner and better appointed room than much more expensive alternatives will definitely retain as option for future trips to london nothing everything was just right this is an amazing hotel we first went in jan   for a six night break and loved it so much that we went in jan   for five nights the staff are very helpful and there are always plenty around the location is fantastic just a few minutes walk to the strand and about   mins to oxford street the rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the wifi works well and allows multiple devices to be logged on we like this hotel so much that we are now thinking about one of the apex edinburgh hotels for the end of feb no negative excellent clean and comfortable room top quality bedding nice to find a feather pillow front desk staff were excellent everything was efficient without any fuss no negative everyone was very welcoming room was lovely bed was the best and great location after having received a call to make sure we had organised ourselves for christmas day lunch we decided to have christmas lunch at the hotel which was good value very nice touch thank you nothing to report great location for nye celebrations and only a short walk into covent garden etc really nice spacious and well equipped room helpful and friendly staff would happily stay here again there wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the new year s eve dinner menu was available however our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu the view from our room and the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff nothing we didn t want to leave the hotel is in a great location the staff were very friendly helpful and welcoming we loved our visit to the hotel which was our second time there and next time we are in london we will definitely stay here again children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on selected an upgraded room lots of space comfortable and the nespresso machine a nice touchno negative the room and facilities are very nice i really wanna stay in all day but yeah we re here to travel the location is good there s a bus stop right in front of the hotel but you may need to walk at least   minute if you come from any underground station nearby service is really poor in this hotel very expensive for low value services for same price you can find something better in the same location there is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all good location in a nice area of london no negative comfortable small hotel with a lived in atmosphere staff very helpful and all facilities you need especially for a place of this size ideally located for southwold would stay again nothing maybe i would have loved to have a bath tub but the shower is good staffs are very nice and helpful well located with buses in front of the hotel to go to oxford streetno negative perfect location you can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions london eye big ben buckingham palace tower bridge as well as the shopping streets covent garden oxford street hotel itself is very clean nice personal the restaurant bar and roomservice are also good no negative comfort of the room is excellent especiallly the technology sky tv and good quality free wi fi the hotel was quiet within and outside especially if you specify a rear facing room i know this is london and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive extremely comfortable hotel beautiful big rooms and bathroom quiet and friendly the bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks one of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental a poor experience compared to the hilton or other equivalent lounges i wouldn t have minded that much but i purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access food in the restaurant was good and the size of the room was excellent no negative lovely hotel from start to finish very clean comfortable and a good night sleep the staffs can t do enough for you well worth the money cant fault anything     rude reception staff at check in rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for   mins then when we enquirer where our other   rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was greatno positive we were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half   by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until   o clock however being the weekend before christmas i can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be i informed the hotel that we were staying for our anniversary when asking for a good view from the room and we were upgraded to a balcony with a wonderful view of london staff were friendly and even put our bags in the room ready for when we arrived back at the hotel later in the day nothing brilliant location between west end and thames riverside always extra special with a warm reception and courteous staff whether front desk or room service cleaners etc there was a big problem the staff apologized and i was to have received a refund of some money but i never did athe issue was stressful i would not return clean facility the standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better you literally could just walk around the edge of the bed breakfast was very expensive we didn t bother just   minutes walk along the road was pret where the price was a quarter as much the room was very quiet considering we were in central london the hotel is tucked away in a courtyard which is nice very comfortable bed very nice walk in shower the location of the hotel is excellent easy   minute walk to convent garden or st paul s cathedral or embankment to catch a boat along the thames nothing staff were super nothing was too much trouble professional but approachable lovely comfy bed so great night s sleep ready to explore all the places of interest so close to the hotelno negative the room was excellent warm with high quality facilities the toiletries were lovely and luxury fluffy towels we also had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurantno negative the hotel is in a very central location but tucked away quite discreetly so it feels private the room was very comfortable no sound carried over from the rooms or hallways allowing us a decent night of sleep the bathroom was beautifully luxurious and clean we also had a drink in the hotel bar which was very good no negative comfortable beds pillows and comforters big bathroom with deep and nice bathtub and large separate shower luxurious bath products fun bar fri sat nights no negative we liked everything from arrival to departure and all points in between apex temple court excels the hotel the facilities and above all the staff are just fantastic it s not really a bad experience but i did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom there was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so i would request a different room next time comfortable room good breakfast and cooked options included in the price nice bar area too nothing would happily stay in any apex property and now considering a stay in edinburgh reception staff were superb the room we were allocated had a great view of the london eye and oxo building quality hotel nothing flashy or cheap all very modern stylish well run and looked after dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend garfunkels near st pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front really good located close to musical area and st pauls very nice rooms big bathroom helpful staff ok not major moans but far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down restaurant wasn t good just about ok food a little cold and too pricey for what is was very clean hotel to the point of sparkling comfortable standard club room with tea making great location for major sighs but out of the hustle and bustle of the west end hop on the bus hail a cab or walk  mins to get almost anywhere breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a   discount the staff were polite and helpful the room was well appointed and the bed was probably the most comfortable i have slept in it was a good location to get to covent garden and tube stations no negative nothing was too much bother for the staff i was meeting up with my sister and brother in law we had tea drinks etc in the lounge not rushed at all expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value great facilities and the club lounge is well worth the extra price staff very helpful and setting and location is excellent we paid   for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking   mins away why don t they advertise this a van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad the staff were friendly and helpful at breakfast a waitress did not understand what we ordered but it was changed very quickly we couldn t check in with two attempts even at    pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone  pm although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully our room was lovely and the staff were attentive welcoming and very helpful no negative the staff were friendly and helpful we received a complimentary upgrade the room was fab spacious and comfortable the breakfast was really good second stay here would definitely return again no negative the staff made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and we only had to wait  minites for our room to be ready the room was lovely and quiet facing the courtyard the facilities in the room were great and we especially liked the big shower parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away the hotel could do with valet parking services i have stayed at some top hotels in england but i have never stayed in a hotel where there were always   staff on reception there was never a queue to check in out or to have questions answered great all round hotelno negative perfect location clean modern hotel and we was given a complimentary upgrade as it was my boyfriends birthday our room was beautiful and big with lots of lovely little extras that make all the difference staff were very helpful with my request for an early check in thank you can not fault it we d definitely return the walk from the nearest underground it s not really that far but i m pregnant so i struggled a little bit the comfort and cleanliness of the hotel room no negative staff were very friendly and welcoming upon arrival the free room upgrade was excellent the hotel facilities were very good the breakfast menu choice was wide ranging and the food was cooked perfectly the location was so convenient to the inns of court the city of london and to central london i just don t think a room without breakfast is worth   i suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it very confy bed great bar with lovely staff no negative it just felt like a very nice hotel and most important for me was the comfortable clean room the friendly staff big shout out to paul it was nice to be able to relax in the lounge after seeing a show location was very good i did not have breakfast so i cant review michael bathroom smelled soooo bad like a dead rat un the pipes and at  h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while i was still asleep what the hell very good bed and equipment in the room nice people breakfast is quite pricey but lovely second time staying at this lovely hotel staff were once again warm and friendly with nothing too much trouble i travelled with my daughter for her  st birthday and the staff all wished her a happy birthday and left her a lovely personalised note and a box of chocolates i love this hotel and can t recommend it highly enough thank you apex temple court for another wonderful stay breakfast in the morning is not very well organized could wait more than   min before getting your english breakfast great location room is not too small very clean comfortable bed great hotel overall no negative modern very clean and very friendly hotel well located food in the restaurant was excellent staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble readily adapted the menu for the children to suit would definitely recommend and stay here again no negative room a good size and comfortable bathroom lovely public areas bar lounge very nice when we came back after our theatre restaurant visits we ended our evening very pleasantly in the lounge staff very helpful and friendly we found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped minor points only one hook in bathroom we needed more lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard we could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water we had a very nice stay   days quiet location no negative very good location close to city centre and thameslink railway spacious rooms nice bathroom and a lot of extra features the breakfast was also very delicious the staff is friendly and helpful the only drawback no parking but there is a public car park   minutes walk from the hotel in the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking special thanks to the staff for it liked everything very comfortable hotel extremely friendly staff comfortable room breakfast is excellent     minutes walk to trafalgar square no negative lovely location very close to the river and a short walk from temple tube lovely walk through temple courts efficient friendly hotel with a great bar really comfy seating and lovely atmosphere restaurant looked good too but we had cocktails and bar snacks in lounge bar which was excellent if a little pricey room styling is modern but well planned and feels a little luxurious love the bathrooms at apex hotels hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting   mins for their cooked breakfast however hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising staff were very good and friendly hotel is in a great location especially for theatre and covent garden overall great place to stay in londonno negative although it s a busy city centre hotel it felt really peaceful and relaxing throughout the soundproofing in the bedrooms must be excellent because we hardly heard anybody else as in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave a very common fault the room design and furbishment comfy bed and pillows great bathroom only one european style   volt electricity plug however adapter would have been available beautiful spacious rooms with moden design but in a cosy way very fast check in and check out beautiful spot very quiet expensive glass wine but you pay for the location not a problem we like to walk back from the theatre at night maybe for some people it would be few hundred meters past their comfort zone the room was very good and staff very helpful slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis bedrooms and the style of the hotel staff are lovely and the hotel is comfortable easy to find off fleet street and close to major sightsno negative excellent centre base for sight seeing would definitely stay here again worth mentioning if you have a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary while staying perfect   out of   from us very few cons entry from street was how we entered initially not best with luggage rear court entry hard to find was better some cabs knew some did not also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function many pros very pleased here modern clean large room and bath excellent stay helpful staff usually stay west of here but this location turned out to be perfect for this trip no negative i booked this for my parents for their golden wedding anniversary trip to london with another couple all four said how fantastic their stay was they commented in particular about how friendly and helpful the staff were and how impressed they were with their room and the hotel facilities no negative we were a party of ten adults booked for a special friends birthday the staff upgraded the birthday girl s room and had it decorated with balloons and banners that friends had mailed down this made a very special birthday a very memorable weekend staff at the hotel were very obliging and couldn t do enough for us all breakfast is very expensive       even if compared to hotels like the househorse guards where it costs some   for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service it s better to go to balthazar or even a starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get the hotel is clean and well located between both temple and chancery lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them the room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need the bed is more for the very soft kind i personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard staff is efficient and very kind no negative what a superb hotel the room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the london eye as it was my boyfriends  th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy the bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid the location was great we were able to walk to every thing we wanted to see breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate they forgot the orange juice excellent decor in the rooms and we ll equipped they gave my husband a small gift for his special birthday a computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay however the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue large room comfortable bed good wifi and easy access to public transportation the toiletries are also very nice quality room was very quiet the pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own hotel is wonderful great accommodations clean and excellent location near soho convent garden the restaurant and bar are expensive not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the west end and thames are just a short walk away beautifully decorated room which was also immaculately clean the bed was gorgeous to sleep in don t think i ve slept in much better the grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on sat sun and monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower more amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on an excellent hotel with a great location apart from a tap malfunction in the main bathroom everything was great a special mention to the concierge who managed to secure us tickets for the theatre at very short notice the master suite was very roomy and very tasteful i would not hesitate to stay here when i am next again in london only minor thing was room wasn t ready   hours after we could have checked in we then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited   hours it would have time from check in to room ready the staff were friendly the room didn t want for anything the ensuite was large and modern breakfast was fabulous the only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out the staff as incredibly helpful and attentive and the concierge is able to book tickets to attractions for us which made the whole process so easy we had a package for free breakfast our first night and the breakfast was amazing the location of this hotel is incredible it s located on a small side street that is very quiet but off of the main road in london fleet st couldn t have imagined a better place to stay in london menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to gafunkals cafe   min walk was a great alternative great location for all major landmarks so much so we walked to most from westminster to tower bridge staff very attentive responsive free upgrade on arrival enjoyed the whole experience so much we added another day to our visit highly recommended nothing we loved the fact that our room had a balcony have stayed in many hotels in london before and never had this luxury at what was a sensible price the only tiny issue i have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service the staff as well as the location and the tabouli rooms make this an ideal hotel for myself and partner to stay at every month when we are in london no milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had can t fault it second time we have stayed here and will undoubtedly stay again nothing great hotel quiet room for a great night sleep as room overlooked a quiet courtyard so no road noise newish hotel so everything felt fresh and up to date great to have sky sports in room have stayed in many london hotels and would rate this as one of the best night stays i wish we could have stayed longer the room was incredibly luxurious and clean the staff were friendly and attentive the location was brilliant a perfect hotel nothing very comfortable room excellent amenities peaceful to step away from london crowds be greeted by the green elephant staff were always welcoming nothing the staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome the room was fantastic big bed and superb bathroom i could not fault anything will definetly stay again next time am in london ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu lovely hotel with nice furnishings and a courtyard for sitting out in the evenings good breakfast too nothing courtyard out the back which takes you away from the main streets lovely place to sit for drinks staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were lovely expensive restaurant lacked any character location is superb for visiting the city contemporary hotel design was good breakfast was good we had a very good meal in the eveningno negative as per the review title this is an oasis in london the calm and quiet starts just yards from the strand very friendly and helpful staff might seem expensive but you get what you pay for no negative had a really nice stay at this hotel received very good service and lovely rooms breakfast and room service food was very nice great location with only a   minute walk in to convent garden breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time the room was big spacious and the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom was similarly huge and had a great standalone bath as well as waterfall showerno negative location of this hotel was perfect most of the sights that i wanted to visit can be visited on foot the room was comfort somerset house was in    mit on foot staffs were friendly the room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far good sized rooms staff friendly and very helpful breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy a few items were unavailable on sunday due to shortages the breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable we were visiting london to celebrate our  th wedding anniversary and the complementary upgrade to a deluxe room was the icing on the cake thank you apex x nothing not to like second time we have stayed here excellent service we arrived at     am and we were still allowed to check in staff very helpful and polite we love the apex hotelno negative the room was really spacious and light and the bed super comfy the rubber duck in the bathroom was a bonus and loved having sky movies no negative excellent location a lovely outside terrace where you could sit and have a drink or eat breakfast in the sunshine would definitely come back having to pay another   each if we wanted breakfast breakfast extra which when the hotel is   per night is very poor not enough tea bags in the room the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom products were of good quality no negative well presented room pleasant staff and good public areas enjoyed sitting outside for coffee good location as we needed to be near covent garden food and drink are overpriced great location and a lovely room huge bath and walk in shower a huge hd television with full sky package pillows were big but somewhat solid hard the pancakes at room service breakfast were hard around the edges great size room for money no negative a haven of peace in hectic london a great hotel which i have visited twice now and which i have promoted to my standard london hotel no negative the room was absoulty amazing clean comfortable felt very welcomed and the front look of the hotel with the elephant was spactauclar to say something the wardrobe in our room was very small everything was ok the place was very clean comfortable and the location very convenient breakfast was not included in the price celebrating a special birthday they give a free upgrade to a suite and a bottle of bubbly nothing the bar food the room upgrade was a wonderful bonus this was our second visit and we will be making a third next yearno negative the size of the bathroom and bedroom not cramped in any way with lovely touches such as bose docking station and samsung flat screen tvno negative they call themselves a hidden gem in london and that s very true it was my first visit here and it will not be my last no negative we liked the style the staff the   access lounge the location which is good for taxis and buses or just walking to the thames breakfast was a bit hit and miss and expensive the quiet location is unusual for london able to sleep with the window open they did a mistake but thier attitude was not enough to me and around hotel there are few resturant open until night good none great location rooms fantastic and they upgraded me to a suite it was huge when i an going to london i am always stay here staff were difficult to locate when wanting to order drinks etc in bar on multiple occasions great location early check in beautiful roomsno negative everything excellent hotel year in year out it is our fourth time there in four years the quality is constantly top the room was smaller than expected so seemed expensive for what it was the location was great and staff very helpful and friendly no negative everyone was helpful and made you feel really relaxed the hotel rooms are very well equipped with everything you could asked for no negative all top nice practical room very clean very friendly and helpful staff and perfect location walking distance to lots of bars and restaurant the bar pricing and the breakfast pricing seemed a little steep even for central london the design and ambience of the hotel was great early check in is not possible approx   hours early only one chair in double room in a such luxurious hotel great location clean room comfy bed ordered full english breakfast to room but came with no toast or bread on side wasnt asked at time of order location and decor comfy bed how there was no aux cable but a speaker in our room and how free wifi wasn t working the size of the rooms and beautiful going back to work at the end of my stay very comfy beds quiet location wonderful staff great food and the rooms were really cosy and welcoming no air conditioning but weather was good so not as big a problem as could have been club lounge very nice view was nice as well hotel address was hard to find with a gps very clean and staff was very helpful first time in london and would use it againno negative on our way to ireland via princess cruise our stay was perfect couldn t have asked for anything better thanks

friendly and helpful excellent staff very clean and very quit room and the location is almost perfect my next stay in london will also be in this hotel not applicable the quiet setting in the middle of a beautiful part of the city the feeling of being abroad with the lovely outside courtyard at times difficult to find the service was superb with people greeting us as we walked in room was excellent more than i expected it was the most boring room with a depressingly grim sitting area the d cor was drab it was the quietest room in london that i have ever stayed in nothing was lovely

expensive especially when there are two of you very good location staff were very friendly and helpful and very smiley no dislikes the bed was extremely comfortable and the room spacious the location

provided us free chocolate as a present little touches no negative location was great staff were lovely made us feel welcome hotel was clean view of london eye was lovely great anniversary weekend nothing bad to report very modern clean hotel staff can t do enough for you good selection for breakfast will be staying again the first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room the size of the room they stolen   from my money from the safe box at my room i couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back they can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money nothing special the room was appalling i had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and i understand that may not always be possible in saying that they gave me a room in the basement supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what i had originally booked which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small there was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work there was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort there was not much room to hang clothes or put things away there was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for   i will not be staying here again the front desk and entrance was very nice and the staff were helpful the change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so i have reviewed some of gust comments before and i faced the same if you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which i will not recommend so the only room fit   adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult the room pic dose not match the reality they transfer me to the park grand london kensington due to maintance work at the park grand london paddington they offer me a free ride to kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it park grand london kensington newer and bigger than park grand london paddington underground station   mins walk people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room the bathroom is clean with all required supplies there is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron no negative this is my second time staying at this hotel the first time i was on business this time it was for mini holiday the bed is very comfortable the room and bathroom very clean and spacious the location is very convenient very good selection at breakfast our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel it did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft very handy location to paddington station and heathrow express and in the pretty paddington area this hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated the staff are wonderful thank you and the english breakfast was excellent not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh good indian and european cuisine noisy air con the room was small but we knew that before arrival i just didn t think that paying an extra   for a room that i wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it the wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it the hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair parking was a nightmare as you have to park   minutes away and trudge back with your luggage this wasn t mentioned before booking i wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under waitrose and was   for two night the price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage the location was good close to paddington and lancaster gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room we had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience i asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for   days was put off additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and i was always hot the junior suite was too small for   people the sheets were not changed for   days choose a different hotel the free breakfast every morning that came with the stay the staff in the restaurant were wonderful our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working the worst part is tiny bathroom it combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet hyde park and public transport are in close proximity we used bayswater station everyday staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes the pub across the street is great the room is small but probably good for value because of price and location very small rooms bed was uncomfortable shower flooded the bathroom no bath carpet and mattress were stained expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard the drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced the photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is this room will only just have enough room for you luggage great transport system nearby especially from the airport lhr customer service is excellent it s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault checking in was very chaotic it was very busy some people had been double booked also when we went to check in at    pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which i didn t think was a very good excuse the hotel was ok but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for location shower run down needs new furniture and painting not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough good aircon comfy bed brilliant shower more tea bags and milk for making your own drinks would be good good shower and toiletries air conditioning big window and pleasant outlook towels and sheets clean and good quality apples available at reception iron available from reception desk rooms were not very well maintained not clean at all to be honest we were expecting better in the money we spent i will never stay in this hotel again good location staff was good no negative location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close no negative the space is good for a family of   the bathroom is clean with all required supplies there is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron the a c control in the room did not work we notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed we needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature the furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat the hotel location is excellent it is super close to the paddington train and tube stations it is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy you walk three streets south and you are next to the hyde park kensington gardens gate i had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items my room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space i feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help not good if you are claustrophobic also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there i would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a     minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate very friendly helpful staff room was cleaned well beautiful building in a quiet area of paddington with good facilities nearby we couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view the room was very modern and clean staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special wifi is slow as it seems to be in most london hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff the room was very small and at the back of the hotel off the main corridor we checked in late in the evening and i felt we got the small room at the back cause we were late arriving the location was perfect tiny rooms v small shower cramped space for suitcase i expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful bed however very comfortable indeed staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room more space just my wife and i packed in room on website rooms appeared much more spacious staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with rooms way to small bathrooms also small tricky to find as there are two similar named hotels in same area quiet pleasant location a few minutes walk from paddington station good sized room and bathroom the restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast i waited a long time for my pot of tea then when i asked when it was coming i was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time no positive underfloor heating in bathroom was on even though there was a heat wave a great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building we had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows bed was amazingly comfortable walking distance to paddngton station and heathrow express the mattress was a little crunchy very helpful and accomodating staff lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab the concierge desk was very helpful was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes but the beds are big short walk from kensington gardens and paddington station lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity helpful friendly staff at reception especially the lady from armenia was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings this is a noisy overpriced hotel when i arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it when i tried to go to sleep all i could hear were people outside and the television upstairs i requested a move and was given a new room some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine in the morning i could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet no positive although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the tv and the provided handy device good location within   minutes walk of paddington quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff easy access to travel points and only   minutes from kensington gardens no negative i booked a triple room the room is quiet large and has a balcony the location is really nice near the paddinton station just about   minutes walk and hyde park the staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need i order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice i will definitely choose this hotel again when i go to london next time nothing a nice hotel in a very convenient area with excellent staff the friendliness of the staff was exceptional they wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was   months pregnant received special treatment breakfast was very good very tiny space no room to walk at all shower is super small i am tiny myself but i didn t have room to turn around the bed is super comfortable i could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there and of course it is very clean the loo hadn t been cleaned and had been well used a compact but well furnished room with a very comfortable bed good lights and an excellent shower the room was a bit small but still very good for london standards i was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure a nice hotel in a very convenient location very clean people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference i also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries all this made up for the price which i initally thought a bit too much and i still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted   a night for a compact room if i paid the full amount i would think it is overpriced but i guess that s london in the summer the design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet would be better if there is a segregation the tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight the club room is comfortable for   clean and bright the room seems to be newly furbished the toilet is spacious too no negative omg what a tiny tiny room you could not walk around the bed without walking sideways no room for anything no barfridge appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique room was advertised as twin bed but was only   bed not very appropriate as i was travelling with my mother  yrs and had to share it no reception for my phone in the roomno positive n a the staff were friendly and polite the location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of london easily there were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance we could not close the door to the main room door without having to lift our bed up and the bathroom was just a wet room that was so small it made the whole bathroom wet stright away the hotel was close to the underground and some nice resturants the staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay i arrived   hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a   hour journey from australia i didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until   hours after their advertised check in time i was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags the toilet floor was covered in urine it was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel the rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in they ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward i ended up checking out after one night as i was there for   days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me there was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom in the morning which i thought was odd there was also no plug near a mirror to do my hair the room was huge and very quiet seat cover in dining room badly ripped which detracted from the ambience a little a mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay very restricted in bathroom too small and did not like the overhead shower staff in restaurant were very helpful at breakfast with gluten free diet selection of food was very good first night i was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening they moved me for the  nd night and the tv didn t work for the majority of the evening friendly staff and easy to walk to the tube clean rooms shower screen could have been a little wider so less water splash but we sorted it very quickly as it was we actually stayed at grand royal hyde park as there was a problem with the boiler at paddington one to make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the hyde park it was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left london at  pm breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want the room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe view wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise all manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner and hyde park   metres away i would definitely recommend this to others bathroom needed a bit of renovation paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for london rooms are a reasonable size for london and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch definitely would return to this hotel the bed was very uncomfortable and too small the room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room the location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff hyde parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to oxford street instead of public transport the hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities nothing everything exceeded my expectations location of the propert was fantastic and near the tube stations staff was fantastic and even the breakfast seemed over staffed rooms are modern clean and even presented a complimentary coffee as we waited for our room luxurious and well price for central london i did not stay long enough to spot any flaws i thoroughly enjoyed the experience very comfortable room and excellent staff they welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions it was not expensive either i am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well overall an excellent and cozy experience i stayed for   days in the hotel first of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small then the a c controller was not working in the room so each time i had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room and the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift they told me they will change the room but they didn t no positive room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing modern room good location helpful staff our room was very small and in a basement that i did not expect the was no space to unpack things from suitcase not much daylight no view i am very fond of bayswater location breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick room was tight bed was so close to wall you could not walk around it made getting into bed a challenge for one partner the hotel offered guest a cell wifi mobile app with map and gps for the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper can t prove this is related but that same evening i had a fraudulent charge on my card for     on itunes the hotel was great but i don t think i will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again no positive no fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless everything had a nice feel to it the staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing booked a club room when we arrived the room was under the main street and didn t even have any windows hardly   star and what you expect from a club room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary dressing gowns   bottles of wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a club room also when going to shower ready for the theatre at   there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower the club room bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label club lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room tottlag a waste of good money spent the porter staff were very friendly the receptionists didn t seem to care the hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small but that is the luck of the draw the hotel is in walking distance from paddington station and so to heathrow that s my reason for using this hotel no negative the hotel was perfect for a short stay in the heart of london very conveniently located for paddington station and the heathrow express highly recommended paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly location is nice and surrounding is also pretty comfortable to find aynthing there was no hot water the day we checked out ended up travelling without a proper bath shave and while checking out not a word of apology either the property is conveniently located near paddington station it was very easy to get to the airport by heathrow express having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised when we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain london grand paddington court we were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days the following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the london grand paddington court instead of the twin beds our room had a double everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites we did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience the breakfast was delicious our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved one had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably really good location very friendly staff and very helpful we were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles we asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar excellent i didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar there was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments the food was just ok it wasn t a great experience the location was great being close to paddington station the rooms are really nice and very comfortable shabby room facilities poor wifi poor tv options terrible interface and charging for movies poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel long hallways with sloping floors not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk may have been fine   years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price convenient location and friendly staff the rooms were well appointed however somewhat small for two friends perhaps with a partner they would have been alright we stayed in a club room breakfast was delicious the staff were so attentive to our needs the heated floor was divine you can smell food being cooked in the morning although we were at the first floor rooms are not quiet too noisy you can hear your neighbors they do not provide complimentary water the staff were really friendly and welcoming the room was too hot and noisy we could not get the temperature down the carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression the shower very small not normal for this price the bar was more like a waiting room the location close to paddington not electricity in room after card was put into place fortunately arrived late and left early but struggled the next day to get to work with low battery life bed was comfortable they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower the bed is comfurtable room is quite large compared to other hotels location is amazing between paddington hyde park and queensway nothing the room had a fridge which is so handy with a nice bottle of cold water waiting for me when i arrived also a plate of fruit was delivered to my room before i had even got there left luggage was also available which is so handy there is a free mobile phone in the room where you can browse the internet and make free calls from i think its called ihandy staff were courteous and helpful great location   min walk to paddington station and about half an hour to oxford st will be using this hotel again customer satisfaction stands out as a priority in this hotel don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms booked a double delux room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a compact double room though reception confirmed we had a delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a compact double room that is what we had very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for   shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase bathroom was a wet room did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by it was clean and staff were friendly and very central nice to have complimentary fruit and water in the room no wine as someone else mentioned i could not easily control the temperature in the room instructions on the wall would help the bed is the best i have ever slept on the buffet breakfast was very accommodating tasty and value for money the shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when i was moved rooms twice the staff were very helpful the room was big and english breakfast was lovely reading lights over the bed should be individual impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room safe difficult to set and in strange position hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe size of room and bathroom staff porters excellent kettle avoid basement rooms no windows we had for one night and staff offered us room change to upper floors for remaining three days when we requested great location walking distance from paddington station and lots of dining options nearby safe and secure area few mins walk to hop on hop off busses hyde park is   mins walk away staff were all helpful accommodation did not match website images not value for money unwillingness to allow us to relocate added in breakfast and transport to compensate for boiler issuesno negative the location was wonderful although our cab driver had a hard time finding it the bed was pretty hard other than that it was great loved the heated bathroom floor i asked the reception to book a taxi for me to the airport but at the time that the car supposed to arrive there was no booking at all so i need to call the taxi company by myself and fortunately there is a taxi available that dayno positive bed was a bit small and air conditioning had a noise problem at some point was fixed quickly but recurred a few times good value and central location cleanliness awful there were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum i was revolted bed no mattress pad gross itchy sheets because of my discovery of the underwear when i moved the chair to the desk i was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay staff unfriendly and unhelpful location to train station havent figured out yet bed was nice and comfortable location excellent within  mins walk of   tube stations lancaster gate bayswater and paddington and absolutely value for money will definitely be back soon good and helpful staff especially andrea at the reception no negative room was cozy as advertised meaning not enough room to walk around the bed i m not complaining it was a great price on the weekend of the london marathon nothing quiet location very close to paddington station and hyde park our room was comfortable and had tea coffee making facilities staff were helpful i would stay here again we booked a trip with   rooms and in one room children of   and   however when we arrived they were given a double bed when i asked for a twin room as the boys didnt want to share a bed we had to pay a considerable amount extra for the twin room which we should have been told upon booking the hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of london and was very comfortable i believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it works the staff were friendly its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted no negative our room was clean cosy and quiet excellent powerful shower and added bonus of under floor heating the breakfast buffet was amazing very polite and helpful staff we will definitely be returning on our next visit restaurant could be bigger arrived at the hotel to be informed that the boiler was broken so moved to the park hotel paddington court excellent hotel amazing staff room upgrade too this hotel needs maintenance or may be even renovation bad hygiene i have never seen a four star hotel with a dirty lift elevator before rubbish litter thrown in the left no body would bother to clean it dirty bed sheets cannot be justified no matter how nice the staff were the staff tried to help not necessarily that they succeeded in that stay here only if you were desperate for a room in london more like for a bed only good for an urgent stay room wasn t bigger than what i have expected wasn t that bad tho location was really nice just   minutes away from paddington station good restaurants and shops are near by small stuffy room and uncomfortable bed the room kettle was out of order footpath was being resurfaced outside our window ground level room rate was quite expensive convenient location friendly staff we were transferred to another room and offered complimentary breakfast due to some problems with hot water in the room we originally booked room had been made smaller what it should havebin not enough room for clothes no bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed not very good for   star location was good the bathroom i didn t so much mind its smallness since i was travelling alone but what i resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool the bed was good heating and or air conditioning were easy to use the ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off didn t get much sleep as a result the staff was excellent and very friendly on arrival at paddington hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel the hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis we received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for london we did not receive it no positive the room was way to hot l went to reception and told them thankfully it wasn t a problem they were able to change some settings at reception to cool air in our room and when we return that evening the room was nice and cool the room was exceptionally clean and the beds are so comfy the staff are very friendly couldn t do enough for you breakfast should be included with hotel price it s a good spread but too expensive for extra fee heated bathroom floor big fluffy towels helpful staff good lift quiet room with comfy beds easy walk to paddinton station there was insufficient hanging space for clothes there could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot the room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring london nice area and quiet we weren t woken up by traffic even though our room overlooked the road excellent location for exploring london nice to have a large shower and underfloor heating the staff were friendly and helpful this hotel was not a hotel i choose before then they transferred a new hotel where it s name is park garden kessington they did not say me this situation before it is very interesting experienced for us we are shocked nobody wants to go a hotel that they did not choose in booking they had to notify me about the changing hotel but they did not do it park grand kessington is easy to go museums and parks lack of advertising there are two of these hotels on the same street having arrived at the wrong one first and waiting at reception to be told that their sister hotel was another couple of minutes walk up the road ok no big deal it was a nice day dinner menu was very reasonably priced great location for my need couldn t really work the mobile device and had to go down to find internet code good proximity to hyde park staff made sure my requests of soy milk for breakfast and a room with windows that open were met things i like white sheets comfy pillows great shower lovely window view not too hot in rooms dental pack big breakfast choice esp fresh fruit and friendly staff like most london hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest room was clean great shower decent wifi request one of the rooms on the outside overlooking a little park   minute walk to paddington station view was terrible i booked a triple room but with the sofa bed up u couldn t get round the room bathroom tiny complimentary fruit etc very nice touch room was awful constant buzzing air con room was dark and cramped booked a luxury deluxe but the room felt like a standard no iron in the room overall bad experience staff were polite and helpful bed was very hard and bathroom would get pretty flooded from the shower but it was small so that might not be preventable food was delicious and location was great ganska slitet n got bristf llig st dning irriterande att det bara fanns tv l gen p belysningen i rummet och att b da s nglamporna styrdes med samma lysknapp bra l ge och rimligt v rde f r pengarna that i had to change hotel first because hot water did not work at this property so i payed for   nigts in a suite but the first night at the other hotel i just got a normal room everything i couldn t point out anything eating lots of lovely apples enjoyed having dinner at the hotel and great ambience at breakfast the staff were really amazing and that would make me revisit the facility when i travel to london not even a conversation with the hotel staff when checking in the room was a deluxe double room didn t seem like it seemed very small considering that this was our honeymoon you would like those extras thrown in like swan towels petals on the bed etc not even a congratulations either that it was close to the train station in paddington the porters were very helpful the girl how served me a few times realised it was our honeymoon and gave me a bottle of prosecco even though i mentioned it in a email very poky room shower room was soaked after a shower and you had to fight with the shower curtain at the same time as having a shower our room entertainment on the tv didn t work couldn t buy movies staff didn t seem bother about our issuesno positive rummet var mkt mindre n v ntat mobilt element men endast ett str muttag frukost var inte v rd pengarna r rigt frukostrum och h gljudd personal och det slutade med att vi t frukost ute varje dag l tt att h ra andra rum via ventilen i badrummet och matlukt fr restaurang bra l ge n ra t bana och massor av restauranger trevligt kvarter during our stay on both mornings we were woken at half   each mornig by a high peck noise coming from the pipes in the bathroom when we complained we were told it never happened by for we were given a   refund which was  pound for the price of the hotel it should of been more by sleep on both nights was ruined no positive room given was in basement with view of a wall and nothing else felt a bit cheated by that staff were amazing couldn t do enough for would recommend to stay here to everyone food was lovely and area great the only downside was the size of wardrobe not very deep and no chest of draws only bedside draws we stayed   nights so wasn t too much of a problem but if you had more luggage not much storage the room was very spacious and comfortable loved the d cor lovely bathroom very good location for access to station the mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife the room one of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage the lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening only one comfy chair made tv watching awkward and difficult we did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast we liked the space in the room and the bed was comfortable the welcome pack and instructions could be more prominent and make clear whether the wine and water was complimentary or not as we weren t sure we avoided using it the room   is small and i do not like having to shower in the toilet area would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if i was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well price and location the beds weren t very comfortable the room was stuffy but we were able to open the window we liked the location of the hotel and it s proximity to padfdington station it s in a quaint residential neighborhood the staff at the front desk was friendly and accommodating the room was nice and modern also very clean no negative i had a lovely card and cake and bottle of wine waiting for me for my birthday from the hotel lovely gesture the staff are super friendly the hotel is only a   min walk to the tube the rooms are small but beautifully put together and cosy highly recommended this is the forth time i have used this group of hotels and the  nd time i have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you i told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me they tried to convince me to go to south kensington hotel which is told rubbish i managed to get another room in the hotel just very poor attitude to use on customers location was   min walk from paddingtonno negative the hotel staff were friendly professional and really hospitable it made my son s and my stay at the hotel excellent we were treated very well the room was quite small and bathroom a little bit basic also found that the a c made some strange noises and had to ask for a remote control for the tv as none in our room we came for a short stay for my partner s  th i contacted the hotel and they laid out some complimentary treats which was a nice touch staff were really helpful and friendly and we were pleased with the hotel overall my father staying in a single room with a twin bed paid almost as much as we did for   people in a large king room with sofa bed top notch service location accommodations a great deal and a restful location just a couple of blocks from paddington station we were very pleased with the service and the kindness from the staff the level of quality of surroundings was superior to other places we stayed in london the bathroom was badly designed you couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle the tap didn t work properly either very comfortable room do not book at this property absolutely no value for money rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush room sizes were extremely small for   people less than  sqm which is beyond human we felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard absolute catastrophe for a   star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area the location is good but that s it the room was small the staff was extremely friendly and smiley breakfast was also delicious and the room was very clean i stayed there on the international women s day and the waiter gave me a flower when i was eating my breakfast in the morning such a nice move you advertised breakfast included in your booking com web posting when i completed the booking it did not indicate breakfast included misleading i emailed you at booking com and received auto reply with no direct follow up to my inquiry i asked hotel staff at check in and was not offered the breakfast your booking service is less than satisfactory in this regard the hotel is not   metres from paddington closer to   metres very courteous staff good indian cuisine on menu clean updated compact rooms with very small but nicely appointed bathroom shower combo they take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further   days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted   despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which i refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit the style of hotel i was charged   more than i should ve been and was never reimbursed the manager was very rude and not very helpful at all excellent room service nice rooms good location my room was a compact double and it was really small made worse by a huge tv fixed to the wall which i had to squeeze past to get around the bed lovely old hotel is quiet georgian square between paddington and bayswater close to both paddington and lancaster gate tube also convenient for hyde park bedrooms deluxe rooms could not swing a cat in it bathroom so small your knees hit the shower screen and has its a wet room if anyone want to use the loo after a shower there was water everywhere the room was lovely and modern but some furniture was looking abit tired and i booked a room that said book now pay at property but i was charged on my credit card which wasn t released for   days after checking out the room was quite a good size and bright and modern the floor in our room was very slippery and we thought we should have had a better room considering they had messed up our booking and we had originally had a room that had no hot water etc food was hot and tasty with excellent service girls on reception weren t very friendly to request a late check out i had to call one hour before check out time   noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until  pm even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website i couldn t book a late check out upon arrival room was a good size and decor was nice incorrect room type allocated rectified for the second night of our stay but no financial compensation problem with electricity in the room on our second morning took almost an hour to repair a smell of greasy food at the main entrance and reception not very welcoming comfy bed and good facilities in the room great location i felt like they tried to trick me when i paid with visa card by offering the choice that i can pay in eur which as far as i understand incurrs additional costs why that no positive the room is so small the compact double room but no space for opening a suitcase everything shall be done on the bed too expensive even considering the location good wifi staff very supportive and professional no negative location of the hotel was fab and very easy to find from the tube station too nice places to eat very close hotel staff very helpful friendly along with the other guests staying there too very simple standard accommodation nothing to shout about no bath only a small shower in the small bathroom the toilet roll was positioned almost on the floor really which got wet when you took a shower staff were friendly close to some restaurants for dinner   small window in room barely any light no view or fresh air felt like a cellar very small bathroom expensive bed was very good waterboiler clean and good great water pressure in the shower fridge in room good location quiet place nice neighbourhood doorman and guests standing at the entrance smoking made it hard to get in and out also once the sofa bed was up fro the three of us it made the room very very small lovely breakfast and very accommodating as we arrived late as it was closing the carpeting in the corridor out side the room was worn out the hotel needs to pay attention to detail the bathroom was not replenished with shower gel and other items had to ask for it everyday the handy phone was a nice touch helped a lot during our stay receptionists that can smile or even respect you as a customer on check in it was great however on departure not even a smile and why does every hotel in paddington area require a photo identity having travelled around the world with the exception of middle east country s only paddington seem to have a hotel a trust issue all very frustrating and unnecessary great find im in london every week and have been looking for a comfortable hotel close to the city centre meals were great and rooms very comfortable will definitely use again room was oppresive already not much light coming in and with dark wood alla round in room you din t want to spend more time than necessary in there i got a disabled room but a men of   cm in front of a sink at   m height isn t comfy staff wasn t present at all beside doorman no one greets even if they stand behind reception doing nothing and watching you pass by no positiveno negative the hotel is a few minute walk from paddington station which is great if you did what i did and took the train in from heathrow the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fantastic i would absolutely stay here again noisy for some reason in the middle of the night you d hear the boiler sound which was extremely annoying since woke me up multiple nights one of the trainee staff came inside the room despite being told not to when they were searching for someone s bags it s nice that they help search not when you are showering on the toilet staff was very friendly located ten minutes from the underground which was nice would have liked fried eggs for breakfast as well if possible we were upgraded to a junior suite which was great as the room was a lot larger the pastries at breakfast were lovely and warm the porters and reception staff were very helpful we were given a very small room not in line with we booked but we were relocated to a bigger one everytime we hada shower during the   days stayed the bathroom was a flooded the bed was really comfortable and the cleaness was very good the wifi worked very well no fridge in the room very noisy heating system and very early and noisy housekeeping very poor and expensive breakfast cheaper to eat somewhere else close to paddington station shops and restaurants easy to get to staff are very pleasent nice size room with bathroom and tv no negative the room itself was great spacious and extremely comfortable the staff make the experience that much better with their friendliness and are always extremely approachable and available the hotel location is also great the walk to the tube was a quick one and a train directly to heathrow airport too when it was time to get home so pleased to have chosen to stay at this property and will definitely be back really small room hit my head on the roof i m not     i m     my wife had nowhere to hang her dress not good for our anniversary bit disappointed think the room would be better use for the cleaner as storage bed was good and it was very cleanno negative unexpected birthday cake with wine and singing staff at breakfast for my husbands birthday lovely all staff were very friendly polite and smiley the food was not as good as i would have wished we ordered room service the steak was overdone and the condiments bowl was full of hp sauce no vinegar mayonnaise etc bed was lovely and room was spacious n a breakfast buffet was great freshly cooked staff very polite and easy to deal with room spacious and comfortable with nice powerful clean shower d our first night put in a rabbit hutch of a room unable to close door properly because bed was in the way the bathroom door also touched the bed the bathroom was just a small wet room no extractor fan took shower room full of water mirrors frosted over impossible to clear hotel obviously taking advantage of customers using this room outrageous to claim it s a double room   not alot although the wifi is working very well there is little to no signal in the rooms of the basement floor   also the heating airconditioning system is a bit noisy the staff is very helpful and always willing to help it is very clean and the rooms are nice i felt on reflection that it was pricey for just a room it was great location within walking distance of paddington which was a bonus with a elderly relative very little space in the room bathroom was tiny was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan and humming noise was constant when turned on also if temperature was set at less than  c the unit was extremely noisy had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room location we didnt have a clue about london before we went so i think we might chose a more central location next time the bed was really comfy thebreakfast was great and good value very noisy in early morning cleaning stuff rude and unpleastant barged in lift and then would not move to let us pass very rude couldnt speak english good location front desk staff friendly room spotless we felt like the room let us down this made us want to eat out and just use the hotel for sleeping staff was the best part of the hotel five stars for the customer service cleaning could be a lot better surprisingly big room stylish loved the bath room especially that there was a shower instead of a tub friendly and helpful staff fire door immediately outisde my rooms banged frequently during the early hours evening meal was served in the bar the restauarant downstairs was only for breakfast no positive nothing i can think of everything was super the beds were perfect service great bathroom fantastic good location to take the train from paddington station loved it older style hotel room with dated furnishings not very spacious for those travelling with larger bags location location right off oxford street london s iconic shopping destination hard to find a single plug socket easy in room wood effect on walls made the room feel small and enclosed heating didn t seem to work well was   but didn t feel even   maybe because room on ground floor and draft coming through the windows didn t see the point of little entrance before getting in room especially there being no plug socket in there very disappointing staff and service didn t end up with the original hotel we booked and we were meant to have deluxe rooms which we didn t have breakfast was excellent hotel was lovely and clean and staff were helpful temp of room a little cool and also needed thicker duvet for our preference but minor complaint location staff s politeness and friendliness only really slept there but perfect for us we enjoyed our stay the courtesy of the hotel staff were great when we arrrived at the hotel we were told that our room was unavailable due to a boiler failure which was a bit of a disappointment but the hotel staff were great and we were told we would be upgraded and receive complimentary breakfast great customer service on the hotels behalf i would definitely stay again the next time we were to visit london there was a leek in the roof above the shower in room   all the staff were really nice yulian was the coolest the breakfast was really good the hotell was lovely the room was very gloomy despite being club room room service was very bad poor ventilation and location the front desk staff were very kind and helpful beds are old and not comfortable at all also the blankets need to be thicker or another blanket added especially during winter time great breakfast great help with suitcases and with my sons pram every time we left the hotel remember to get a room that s not in the basement level b nice helpful and serviceminded staff good breakfast upgraded room in  rd floor light and bright i think a bed topper on the mattress would have let me sleep better i like hard beds but this one was a little too hard i loved the location and the staff i felt very safe there and was never at a loss to find help if needed lovely place even though it had small rooms i really was comfortable nothing everything about the park grand was excellent from the moment we entered the door to the time we left we were made to feel welcome the room itself was fantastic comfortable immaculate and modern with everything you could possibly need the bathroom with underfloor heating was a lovely touch especially for my feet the restaraunt was lovely with a great choice of food and beverages wich were all very tasty couldn t fault the service here and will definitely be returning it was bought as a present for my sister but even though i was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room her review follows the room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening i slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption i cried once in the morning and once at night they are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise they admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training i could not go out in the evening as could not afford it i had to stay in the hotel for the friday and was able to spend what little money i had on the saturday oh and at breakfast i hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have the deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night when i had a shower i had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel very upset with their unbending policies they need to think about their customers the staff were nice and the food was lovely like the mobile phone you could use in the room free of charge was a nice and unusual touch the walls are so thin you ll wake up every time someone passes the corridor your bed will liteally shake when someone walks in  m perimeter i couldn t get a good sleep on any night the room was modern and clean the location is really good there are crazy good restaurants in   min of walk no negative as extensive travelers this was by far the best experience we have ever had as a family the jr suite was so comfortable with two kids in europe it is almost impossible to find comfort for a reasonable price they provided great wifi along with a complimentary cell phone to use while we were there the breakfast was hearty and delicious the staff was super courteous the rooms were modern and clean we could walk to hyde park in   minutes along with some great pubs within walking distance i cannot say enough great things room was baking hot but phoned reception and they turned off the heating staff very polite and helpful room small with limited storage but it was billed as a compact double and it didn t matter for one night i used the small gym there was no one else in it walk to hyde park in ten to fifteen minutes would book again the size of the bathroom was abit cramped i thought that the style of the room was lovely and modern and the bed was nice and spacious and comfortable staff very friendly too the elevator was too slow we had to order empty cutlery cups and glasses every day the room survive should have this changed for us everyday the staff were very friendly and polite front desk was always there at anytime clean and descent hotel just at the right location the area was safe and quit i asked them by email for an earlier check in and they never answered back we arrived at the hotel about an hour before the regular check in time and they let as wait till the exact time the room was a little bit cold and the air condition was not working correctly the tables for the breakfast was very small the location was perfect very closed to paddicton tube station and to the heathrow express station   from the beautiful hyde park the neighborhood was so beautiful and quiet the bed was also great and the room was big and very clean our room design could be better needs small lights by the bed instead the only choice is to switch on very bright lights which are set in a very high ceiling above the bed blinding very helpful staff friendly and welcoming good room service great shower quite stylish room if a little soul less sadly had to leave early before we could sample the breakfast was a bit strange going to the basement for a room the room was very nice and the bathroom was not cramped the bed was not tiny like most of them usually are i booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed however the bed was pretty small the duvet was quite thin so i had to call down reception at  am for a blanket also the room was very small quite claustrophobic the next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee we are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for   minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left not good service at all the area is fantastic sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door i slept on sofa bed not very comfortable the breakfast room in the basement was a little chaotic with customers and staff everywhere the food was good but not a good dining experience not what i was expecting compared with the rest of the hotel the room was clean tidy and comfortable though rather small the shower was great nice size tv i booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it the room was tiny literally the smallest box room i have ever stayed in the bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided the shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet there were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult i resorted to using the tv to see my reflection as i blow dryed my hair the room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened altogether an awful experience and i will not be staying there again the pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got very very disappointing  instead walk to paddington station therefore good access to all tubest etc hangar space limited friendly and helpful staff close to tube and paddington main line   mins walk hyde park   mins walk very comfortable bed in quiet area yet bars and restaurants nearby a little farther from paddington station than l expected  hour room service would be nice modern room well kept very clean good bathroom with walk in shower heating system very quick to work good wifi the room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around london hotel is lovely very clean and everything you need hairdryer supplied and no need to bring my owe as if very long hair some hotel hairdryers are shocking central to the tubes and busses and staff very helpful when look for directions the room could have been a lot warmer there was no visible heating in it but there were   electric radiators but because there were   of us we had nowhere to put them breakfast was fine plenty of hot water clean towels very friendly obliging staff underground was only an   min walk with the bakerloo line you have very good access to all the main areas the room was noisy at night either because if the water pipes or air conditioning people would also stand in the corridor and have loud conversations outside of my room not the fault of hotel just rude people i had the compact double room and it really is compact wouldn t recommend for   people i m not a tall person and my feet were hanging off the bed shower was very small but convenient if you want to use the sink sit on toilet and shower all at the same time i didn t but it s possible friendly and helpful staff location was spot on and close to a number of tube stations easy walk from paddington station to the hotel for the heathrow express clean room i was expecting to get a better room as we booked deluxe double but the room was located on the ground floor did not have a bath only shower so i do not think it was a deluxe room as we originally booked i liked the location of the hotel easy access to underground and railway services the staff is very friendly and helpful my room was right next to reception and really noisy all night with people coming and going and shouting room was also tiny and we didn t even have the smallest room was clean bed comfortable shower good room a bit dated and needed some tlc iron leaked everywhere friendly staff very welcoming clean bathroom and always maintained warm and comfortable bed     mins walk from the tube which was good after paying to secure the reservation i was asked to pay for the room upon arrival the money has been taken out of my bank account twice was advised that it was a pre booking that the money should be refunded into my account in   days not happy my account has gone overdrawn if the money hasn t been refunded by tomorrow then i will contact customer service and get them involved no positive nothing this hotel and staff are superb definitely stay here again the staff were friendly and very helpful the hotel is amazing the room was very comfortable and had all little extras the only thing we didn t like was the wet room style shower in the bathroom however it was bearable the staff were very helpful and the beds in the room were comfy the location was brilliant as well no negative i paid for room with breakfast included this was s trip i bought for my son and his girlfriend and both mornings they were questioned as to whether they had paid for the breakfast so hotel experience little spolit we were disappointed to find our room was not ready when we arrived at  pm it was then ready after     mins so not too bad but as we were booked for dinner and a show in the west end it was stressful for us all at the time no positive there were a lot of stairs the location is very good only  min stroll to paddington tube the staff were very friendly helpful the room was spotlessly clean very warm with beautiful furnishings the wine fruit was a lovely touch no negative this hotel is excellent i loved the location the atmosphere of the hotel the cleanliness the food the google maps phone have never seen this in any other hotel but above all i loved the staff they were so friendly and helpful and always smiling room was a little small but that would be expected from being located in a central area bed was comfy and facilities were good the hotel is located in a good place just a   minutes walk to the station staff was very friendly and helped with luggages that we had we were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us rooms were too small it s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains we had   adults and a baby with a baby bed even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work however it was a nice place to stay in a decent location lancaster gate station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also the staff were helpful especially the bellhops who seem to take on almost every role if we needed something it was taken care of within minutes the rooms were nice only qualm was they are really small we enjoyed the breakfast nothing too fancy but it was nice and also nice not to have to arrange getting our own our breakfast was included the room was a little cramped for   people considering the price that was payed for it staff were very helpful they took time to explain the tube systems and how was best to get to places the room was cold on arrival the heating was turned off and it took a long time to warm up also it only single glazed the location ideal for what we wanted the check in girl was not very helpful basically she said i couldn t stay there because i didn t have photo id i informed her i had stayed there before but she didn t care ended up letting me stay the room didn t have no towels in it i had to call room service to get them the bathroom smelt very bad like old potatoes i will not be staying again close to everything the room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the u k the room on the  th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open location was great although due to a boiler failure we were moved to a sister property the room is way too small no matter how well appointed it is nothing the hotel does can make up for the fact that this feels like a rip off every single moment barely any elbow room great location for the property close to hyde park the breakfast was nice and the staff was courteous the pipework in this building is very noisy and we could hear it people all night using the taps we also were originally placed in a room in the basement without windows which was not mentioned as a possibility in the room information no positive the shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use checked in late after flight cancelled at heathrow gentleman at reception was great he was friendly polite and helpful the location was good plenty of places to eat within walking distance only   min walk to paddington station with luggage the room was clean and the bed was comfy but my daughter and i are not too fussy the bathroom could have a bathtub the reception staff noticed it was my birthday and when i arrived back in my room there was a piece of cake with happy birthday written on the plate i thought that was fantastic we went to the wrong parkgrand paddington moments before and they were very rude staff before they told us that we were not staying in this hotel as soon as i stepped through the door a member of staff took my bags off my hands and gave me a ticket this was so that we could go grab something to eat whilst they hold our bags and wait for our room to be ready the room was amazing also the room was incredibly hot however as soon as i rang reception they lowered the temperature immediately so we could sleep i just wish i had rung them sooner and given them an opportunity to help out earlier i could fault their service hotel was extremely nice staff were fantastic the room was to small and there was not enough room or hanging space no place to hang your coat or sit the room was clean the bed comfortable the staff pleasant the breakfast good one member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy most comfiest bed i ve come across in a hotel heated mirror and floors in the bathroom preventing misting up brilliant idea there was constant cold draft coming from the window which made the room cold at night even though the windows were closed it did not make any difference i hope the hotel can look into this matter the bed was really comfortable and the room was clean the location of hotel was also really good and accessible to paddington station no closet in the room leakage from shower doors small but comfotable room very clean excellent breakfast good location   min to underground station i didn t book another night should have bed was very comfortable really enjoyed the nice powerful and warm shower the media facilities were top notch the ability to use a hdmi socket in the room is a great touch not being able to sleep very loud noice in room sounded like a generator disappointed on the very little sleep i had location close to hyde park as that was reason for visitingno negative the staff were very polite and helpful good location and comphy beds heated toilet floor was a nice surprise a very relaxing stay will definitely return to the hotel minor issues no lamps next to bed only spotlights that are too bright no plugs next to bed for phone charger no ironing board and iron in room major issues heating system didn t work properly impossible to control and was just too loud to have on while trying to sleep ended up just turning it off which meant we were freezing all night loud buzzing noise all night from either heating system or extractor from within wall cavity made it near impossible to go to sleep rudely woken at   am by idiotoic delivery men dropping off laundry our room was ground floor next to the rear entrance talking loudly non stop banging doors with engine on right outside our window for atleast an hour totally unnacceptable if that wasn t bad enough at  am we were again rudely woken by some prat outside our windows removing hundreds of bags of rubbish from the basement below our room onto the road ready for collection absolutely no acknowledgment that paying guests were asleep less than a metre away from him and with the windows single glazing these loud people may aswel have been in our bloody room this room should not be in use with the current routines they have in place the whole experience was just a shambles after telling reception during check out we were brushed off with i will tell the relevant departments no mention of sorry or i ll arrange for a manager to call you good shower the shower wasn t designed particularly well as everything around you either got very wet or you got stuck to the shower curtain location was excellent for paddington station great design of bedroom nice staff the only thing i d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were ok but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers also as i am a genius booking com member i had free late check out but i wasn t able to find out whether i could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans i stayed here with my other half for one night in december i put down a special request on my booking as we were celebrating our one year anniversary we arrived slightly early at the hotel at     but check in was     unfortunately the room wasn t ready yet but they held our bags for us and we went out as planned and checked in a bit later on once we arrived in our room later on it was beautifully decorated with   swan towel s on the bed with real roses all round the bed little things like this go a very long way so thank you very much our double bed was two twins pushed together and i kept falling into the gap bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking i prepaid for our room   months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card i paid on i no longer had this the staff member insisted that i paid again on a bank card that i had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card i was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card i paid on after paying again on my only debit card it left me   short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take   working days i had prepaid so far in advance so that i could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london my husband and i very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the weekend for us location was great only a   minute walk from oxford street the breakfast was good the reception was welcoming no satelite tv no parking at the hotel closest parking was     minute walk away in a pay display carpark shower was very spacious breakfast was good plenty of free hot drinks in your room was located close to hyde park  minute walk away i made the booking on behalf of my   year old son i am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that i was to be refunded this practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son i had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications in my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to heathrow airport the following morning please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed the reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow it should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible helen jacksonno positive rooms are a bit small without enough room to hang clothes in wardrobe also not enough wall sockets we had to move furniture and look behind wall fascias great staff and good location nice and clean tiny bathroom with no counter space great location close to many restaurants hyde park and the tube friendly and helpful staff we were upgraded to a club room free nobody had told us that our original hotel was undergoing maintenance but it was all sorted very quickly the facilities in the room the location was close to where we needed it to be and the staff were really helpful size of room small wardrobe space tiny for   people staff very friendly breakfast lovely reasonable distances from tube station nice restaurants nearby the size of the bathroom is very tiny especially in the standard room the location was excellent for travelling by the underground the staff were very helpful and accommodating to our requests the staffs attitude the cleanliness found nail clippings on the floor by the bed and also a dirty extension lead that was left in there by a guest before health and safety plug socket loose on the wall the location didn t look like the photos online there were biscuit wrappers and rubbish on the floor by the bed easy check in good location able to leave our bags for the day the room wasn t very warm even with the heater on the small vent in the roof wasn t enough for the room super comfy bed in the club room amazing shower standard room was no bigger than a closet stuffy and bathroom was a wet room very tiny room suitable for one person for one night staff very friendly and quick to respond when tv didn t work expensive for what we got location was very good for hyde park and shops tried to overcharge me for breakfast i d already paid for luckily i still had my confirmation email to prove it hairdryer difficult to get to as positioned in cupboard over bedside table location however when we went up to our room the  rd bed had not been made up so we had to wait for all the bed linen towels etc to be brought up restaurant was absolutely boiling is there anyway that it could be better ventilated our room wasn t ready when we got there no problem we were there before check in time and were invited to wait in the lounge and have a complimentary drink on return to our room at the end of the day we found that we had been upgraded to a junior suite thank you very much beautiful breakfast everything you could think of and lovely staff attendingno negative great customer service offered at reception quick and very polite upgraded to an excellent club room free of charge i would happily visit the hotel again our room was on the basement floor and there was a noise coming through the air vent the entire night which made it very difficult to sleep the staff was very friendly and accommodating had no dislikes found the hotel to be just what we needed paper delivered each morning which was a lovely surprise really enjoyed the extra space in the club room the receptionists were not polite their english wasn t even that good to begin with the room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if i was a bit fatter i wouldn t be able to pass the bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains the toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet the location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area i can t think of anything i liked about this hotel if anything the curtain rail was slightly off centre my partner only noticed as she spent a long time lying on her back the cushions were particularly comfortable and beautifully arranged on the bed perfect for jumping and or building a small fort the shower was a very good size our neighbours even joined us we managed to fit all   without any bruises the bed on our room wasn t very comfy the sofa was a lot softer and we would have shared that instead of the bed if it was bigger the hotel was very clean and quite a night i informed the reception when i checked out that one of the bathroom tiles were loose and raised i also explained that i had stubbed my toe on the tile i stressed that i was not complaining merely pointing out a fault that i thought needed attending to i was disappointed that the receptionist showed little to no interest location i booked   nights in this hotel i have paid the total fee when i arrived at the hotel but they also take   poubds pending transaction from my bank account i will leave uk in several days and cancel my uk bank account but they did not return my money i sent them emails but they didn t have reply me i ll not recommend this hotel to my friends disappointed friendly staff room was tiny even though it was meant to be double deluxe room but staff changed us into another room quickly the heating system is really loud it was clean staff were friendly helpful good location no negative absolutely amazing went hear for my birthday they arranged something special for us was lovely staff were amazing very good room was amazing stayed in a club room it was so spacious and clean would recommend to anyone to stay hear will be going back regularly n a the design of the room was fabulous with concealed wardrobes desk etc and was extremely comfortable the flowers fruit and bottled water were a pleasant extra and the staff couldn t have been more helpful this is the best value hotel i have ever stayed at in london and it was only a few minutes walk from paddington and   minutes from hyde park the staff were totally professional very smart eager to help and efficient there was a comfortable lounge and a free to use smart phone and charger for maps or to book trips tours taxis etc though we were opposite the lift on the third floor the design of the entrance hall into the room and double doors meant that no noise at hall could be heard and i had a perfect night s sleep the restaurant was not open in the evening meals had to be taken in the bar area also no childrens menu or offer of smaller portions staff helpful the room was compact and efficient but lacked warmth very corporate and clinical feel reception staff could not have been more helpful pleasant and accommodating the ventilation pipe was passing through my room and at certain moments at night it was producing much noise not letting me sleep well the room was really small and the shower tight the staff was friendly and helpful the room was clean with complimentary bottled water tea bags fruit and coffee biscuits the room was small especially the double bed which was incredibly small the breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and expensive the wardrobes are not wide enough to hang more than one jacket they resemble the fridge door in their size the breakfast was very good the hotel has an excellent chef the air conditioner made a bird noise constantly we had someone look at it it stopped for about   min and started again we previously stayed at this hotel for the past   years this year the room was tatty we asked for an early check in by     hour the room was not ready for   hour after we arrived i do not believe we will stay there again i don t believe it was good quality for the price the bed was comfortable the bathroom was clean and nice towels you could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by the bed is the best thing about this hotel sleeping on a cloud staff could pay better attention to detail eg i booked a wake up call and never received it when i let them know that they basically didn t care locality and quietness of hotels making sleep and rest easier rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet convenient location to paddington station my only small issue was i thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal excellent location easy walk from paddington station even with bags quiet for central london staff particulary friendly and helpful i had a free upgrade to a junior suite which was very spacious and comfy very small bathroom in effect a wet room fine for me but could be a bit small for a less able or larger person staff were very friendly and helpful nice little bar area just off reception bed very comfortable price excellent for this part of london the rooms were extremely small wardrobe was not usable no where to hang up anything wet also can hear the shower running in other people s rooms below and above you the location wasn t bad you can easily hear people talking or walking at the corridor the service was fantastic i was relocated to the grand lancaster gate around the corner due to some problems they were very helpful counting with a staff of young profesional people always with a smile on their faces the bed was very comfortable my room was kind of small but did not mind was good for me and for one weekend they welcome you with a fruit drink breakfast was good enough for sure a hotel to come back and to recomend the air conditioning unit was making a lot of strange sounds beyond those of a typical unit the bed was very comfortable the mobile device for tourists was handy and a nice touch staff were very polite and welcoming room was a bit cold and only a plug in radiator to warm it up ventilation system made an annoying humming noise every so often bed very comfortable and location was perfect just away from the busy oxford street but close enough to be convienient the evening dining facility was not so good with a bar menu meal had to be sent back although again the lady on duty was very apologetic ourselves and various guests could be heard making detrimental comments on items purchased the staff where exceptional nothing was too much trouble and breakfast was very good value for money hot fresh with a good variety i had a bad experience with this hotel during check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me i felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around   miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system so i decided to to turn the table against them so i request from woman in front desk to show me the room for testing the water heating system by my self suddenly her supervisor came i forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel it clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests during that an european guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly i start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality what a shame so the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location later they change the room i will never book again in this hotel no positive i booked for   nights instead of   i contacted them within   minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though i contacted them straight way the built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed the english breakfast was great the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the hotel was in a great location in terms of value for money a shower curtain there was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor bed was comfy room had a big closet for luggage the reception area was beautiful and a   min walk to the trains and the heathrow express the hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money you then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it the room was a good size and the location was central but quiet the staff were very friendly and welcoming and let us borrow an umbrella when the rain was really bad relatively compact rooms and small bathrooms limited closet storage space for clothes convenient location next to my office at walking distance quiet street but near many restaurants indian owned hotel with indian chef in kitchen there was nothing on this occasion that i didn t like if i was going to be picky i would of liked it to be closer to the main shops the room was very nice bed was highly comfortable the staff were very friendly and didn t rush me unlike other hotels i confused this with the park grand paddington which is a few doors down the street their premium rooms are nevertheless rather small and kidney shaped ok for a   night stop over but hard to settle in to for longer affordable stay in a good location near paddington and the central line easy to get in and out of the city room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night i ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful the only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold we had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night consequently we all had no sleep it really wasn t acceptable the room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too really marred our holiday hotel offered   back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night such a shame because this place could be really great spotless hotel modern features great extras in the room dressing gowns wine bath products fresh fruit and a lovely breakfast see above bed was wonderful breakfast eggs were a watery disaster the shower in the deluxe double was a drain in the floor shared with the loo the bathroom tile grout needed serious scrubbing gross and when i needed change for a smaller money denomination was told that was not possible by a blonde trainee but very quiet room with great view and close to paddington and harrods also the rest of the in house staff went the extra mile   start hotel should do more than a poor service every thing is chargeable even water the size of the room is so small and the design is very strange can not understand it the matters and pillow is very poor quality and had strong headaches every day morning the staff is frindey views aren t fantastic and the plumbing pipes are a little noisy from other rooms very clean simplistic and a huge welcome after a double booking elsewhere nothing was too much trouble when speking to the staff no negative everything the staff were amazing attentive friendly and couldn t do enough for us the hotel room itself was absolutely stunning and the breakfast was delicious the one time i did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter on the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items badly designed room someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues it s the  rd time i ve booked this hotel on   occasions i have been moved to a neighbouring hotel the lancaster gate location was great their hyde park location was ok the staff are always helpful compact double is a very small room tight wardrobe space safe not big enough for laptop no mini bar and or complimentary drinking water certain furniture fixtures looked quite used and could do with replacement refurbishment all in all a pleasant hotel though friendly staff good location only a short walk to paddington station and easy check in out comfortable bed and nice decor throughout also got upgraded to a   star hotel for the first night as there was a maintenance issue in the hotel this was taken care of very professionally although there is in room ac it seemed to make no actual difference to the temperature of the room if you need a place to stay to be close to the heathrow express then look no further great location nice rooms helpful staff the television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean with good towels hot water working but worked out better for us in long run we actually didnt stay here they had a problem with hot water they transferred us over to montcalm next to liverpool st station with free brekkie and taxi over the original place did look brilliant from what i seen though shower room leaked water into the bedroom as the floor drainage wasn t appropriate previous occupants had got the carpet wet which wouldn t be difficult you need to shower in minutes to prevent water seeping into the bedroom hotel was in easy access of paddington station quick and easy check in room was ready upon arrival room was either way too hot or way too cold and window didn t open properly so had to have air con on to cool down but then became too cold no happy medium lovely hotel very well presented staff tried hardest to help you had everything you needed and breakfast was amazing no new bottles of water to drink every day also only get biscuits with coffee in room on first day the air conditioner units just outside of the window makes a lot of noise during the night no positiveno negative the room was clean and comfortable with a view over a quiet street lined with trees although space was somewhat limited as other reviewers have mentioned this didn t affect the quality of our stay and we would come back again we had an excellent breakfast freshly squeezed orange juice and real coffee with strength and flavour a good range of food options and friendly service the staff were all polite and helpful and we were very happy with our stay at the hotel fire door near our room banged during the night slightly annoying and could wake you up breakfast was lovely good choice and quality great service friendly and polite the amount of sugar and milk that is left for you to make coffee tea unfortunately left a necklace in the room before we left for another location was never located the beds were really comfortable and clean the size of rooms for london were what could be expected advantage close to edgeware rd and central to rail and busses we were on ground floor with great bay windows but it must of been bin collection day so a bit of an early wake up call lovely area and rooms were modern with amazing shower the bedroom appeared small with all the wood around it the breakfast room was tiny for a full crowd and as was the bar where people could not enjoy a drink without listening to the table next door the bed was comfy buffet breakfast was a bit expensive rooms were a bit tiny but manageable conveniently located close to tube station staff were helpful friendly and nice rooms were a little small but comfortable ideal location for central london very close to a laundromat ideal for travelers would definitely stay here again the evening dinning area needs to be improved breakfast choice and standard was great free use of a smart phone in the room which you could take out with you no negative breakfast was excellent lots of choice great location easy walk to two underground locations quiet neighborhood amazing value for money in london no privacy the staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside i found that quite shocking never seen anything like this in my life the staff will knock but will not wait long enough they just barge in also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word the layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room cleanliness is good breakfast is good originally placed in the basement which is totally depressing without a window however i did ask to be moved and they happily obliged lovely room friendly staff we booked a deluxe room however the room was very small and it was difficult to change clothes for our night out therefore didn t seem like a deluxe room location and cleanliness the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed price and location very good value what s with the breakfast confusion can t british hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts it was one price if booked the day before a higher price that morning oops you re not on the list blah blah blah north american hotels have no problems dealing with this put it on your room or pay on the spot no dual pricing so easy please break the uk mode and make it easy reasonably close to paddington station so you can take the heathrow express train and walk good continental breakfast once you got past the convoluted sign up process and pricing first night we had to stay in an extremely small room they did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay staff was great good breakfast good location not much the bar closed earlier than i would have liked surrounding area didnt have a lot going on but close enough to paddington station good location very friendly staff and a decent bar and restaurant area room was well equipped our room was not serviced the bed was two single beds pushed together the room is a great size and very comfortable all you could want in a hotel room the air conditioning was not working and i had to change the room in next day and i could not sleep well that night great breakfast and location not far from the subway and train station the tea and coffee making facility was poorly positioned on bed side table in my opinion this could potentially be very dangerous due to limited space need to find an alternative area polite staff good selection at breakfast comfortable beds suit space is very small bathroom without a tub or shower breakfas area is small closed and crowded i styed in suit with king bed size but i foud it tow mattresses not one with king size it s horrable while you are sleepingno positive the heating didn t work certainly not worth paying this much staff were not very helpful or apologetic but rather claimed their screen in the reception said it was warm soy milk at breakfast was either old or diluted with waterno positive fire alarms kept on going off randomly bit disturbing lighting in the room wasn t that great but overall a good stay with minor drops comfy beds the staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least i was finally shifted to a bigger room but when i requested for check out till   pm on friday the lady told me that till   it was okay and she will try for   then she says that she will do it only till   and not till   no reason was given for this at all the only good thing was the location size of the bedrooms were small had to phone each time for a ironing board breakfast was mediocre no comfort in the bar each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom the staff were friendly the day are holiday ended deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower room clean modern and made decent use of small space it wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com the room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room after we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working it took a long time to deal with this in the evening the showers were weak in both rooms one day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed overall too many problems good location the automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense but no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how i could go about getting it the bathroom was very nice and rain shower was great to have staff was friendly and courteous but more knowledge about places to eat or see around the hotel would be nice deluxe double was tiny my partner is  ft and hanging off the bed we were next to an elevator so loud noises all night shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure tv was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly if u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable but saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us good location for us quiet street very nice area right near kensington gardens which means u can walk straight through to hyde park and get to harrods ect also walking distance to   tubes which was handy and they give u a mobile so u can use to find ur way around london which was very handy it was quite slow and frustrating at times but still a really nice touch that i haven t had before very poor value for money very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out very disappointed and first time i ve had a poor hotel from booking com the staff were friendly the breakfast bleak and poor for that price even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve the welcoming atmosphere the friendly straff that made us feel special they even surprised us with a nice handwritten birthdaycard cake and fruit on my daughter s birthday a hotel worth four stars with a great and quiet location close to kensington park and paddington station the room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain the room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat there is only enough wardrobe space for about   things to hang in when i asked why i hadn t got any complementary water i was told it was because i booked through you i made a fuss and did get it in the end but i felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over   for the two nights the food was excellent room was tiny and dark i got moved around to a different property one block away because park grand had hot water issues then when i checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location too much money for such a small room staff were helpful and patient room was quiet and clean the main mattress for the bed is too soft feel painful for the back after sleep overnight the mattress for the sofa bed is too weak i still can feel the springs they can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses the location is excellent close to so many underground stations such as paddington lancaster gate central red line bayswater dark blue line queensway red line also close to the kensington garden due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in it was the walkpath to go to all the rooms the staff were extremely professional friendly helpful the mobile phone hotel property that was given to guests during their stay was very useful small touches like having a basket of apples a box of tissues at reception gave a welcoming feel also the extra amenities that were provided in the room upon arrival were appreciated room was too small for   people a double bed with   mattresses does not pass as a twin overpaid for what i got staff were friendly and efficient room was clean nearby facilities were reasonable the double room was so small there was no room to store bags two people were unable to dress at the same time the walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided the gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating the only plus was the location being fairly central the shower water is hard i couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while also on arrival at the airport i called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer i also found the direction address given to me unhelpful in fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one i booked for was under renovation i turned up at the place i booked and found no renovation going on and busy and i got the room i booked for perhaps it was a mixup the breakfast was good the bed is firm just as i liked the environment is quite and just a short distance from good restaurants and the underground and train station the bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position on showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area the bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily it was just awful i will not book this hotel ever again in this paddington area of london the bed and carpet were most comfortable everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in central london however a room which has just   inches of space around the bed washroom was also a disaster   plus per night is deserves more location is good walking distance from paddington station one of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to underground station close to restaurants and shopping for travel needs a bit of a walk from paddington so took a short taxi ride with the bags quiet nice breakfast and very friendly staff the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard no counters to do makeup or blow dry hair the room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in the bed was comfy and the use of hotel was a lovely touch for first timers in london staff at the reception very friendly and helpful no negative hotel that i originally booked had a problem with the room so they asked if i would mind being upgraded and transferred to another one of their group hotels i agreed and they provided free transportation refreshments in the bar whilst waiting and a great new location will stay there again we arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room they then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day it then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room the bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what i can only describe as orange zest all over it this was at     am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at     wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until     to check out we left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again it really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely but at the tune of     for less than   hours we wont ever be going back the room did look that when built was a high standard the hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves i booked a double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that i was checking in late there was no room for me when i showed up at midnight there was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing they moved me down the street into a single and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room booo don t just walk run away from these crooks no positive room a bit small our room was much more stylish than most hotels in the paddington area we were moved from a hotel down the street because of problems with the hot water but the alternative was great the staff at the hotel was amazing and we really felt welcome and we would definitely recommend a stay here the room had a terrible view of a scruffy building and the windows were disgusting lack of parking and staff said it would be ok to park where we did ended up with a parking fine ruined a birthday suprise i had planned for months for my partner wouldn t stay again the bed was so comfortable thumbs up fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t the space is small and okay if you re travelling solo highly attentive and polite service without being intrusive this hotel is one of three in the collection all within a five minute walk of each other and paddington station we were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple the rooms were too compact wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles some of the staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was very good delayed checking despite not arriving till  pm   bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for   provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for   breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts no where near a   star more like   we don t understand how the aa rated as a   star definitely not worth the discounted cost the staff are all the property has going for it small room at basement floor great location as in paddington super staff offer bigger room at high floor since second day value for money when cinder london room very small but spotlessly clean the room was spotless but very small i would have liked it to be a larger room for the rate the hilton up the road was a similar rate for a much larger room the staff were vet friendly and helpful no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator very small room i think the bedsheets were not changed everyday close to underground station staff was nice and helpful free printing which was useful free wifi free  g phone in room you can use google maps some of the furniture was very dated and needs replacing i didn t like our club room being situated in the basement bed was comfortable the decor was nice the bathroom was quite small and no bath lovely breakfast had a junior suite for great value free paper short walk from paddington station would stay here again would like to have had a bit longer for check out but this didn t really cause us too much of a problem the location for us could not have been any better the breakfast and staff were also excellent complimentary wine was perfect after a very hard day the chairs in the breakfast room had no padding towels need to be bigger as i m a average sized person and they didn t go around me staff were friendly and helpful liked the iphone for use in the room the room we have been given was not as i saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small no places to hang my clothes the location the cleaning staff usually forget to replace toiletries that have been used up the croissants were just perfect my little daughter is a picky eater but she just loves it we booked twin room but when we arrived they gave us double rooom anyway the other day they offered me the twin room the hotel has air conditioner in all the rooms and the rooms were clean and tidy everyday the stuff were really nice and the location wasnt that far breakfast wasn t great our hotel had maintenance probs taken to hyde park grand hotel instead room was okay some parts a bit tired looking had discount online nights stay would have been a little disappointed if paid full price staff were very nice and hotel close to station when we checked in at the given time of  pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for   hour   hours later our room was still unavailable due to having plans my husband   year old daughter and i had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room we then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel   hours later however we found this very unsettling there was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable the room was clean and comfortable also the free english breakfast was lovely location was great   minute walk from underground station a single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable the price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal a quiet location not the hotel i booked room too small to swing a cat in inflexible cancellation policies clean relatively comfortable breakfast fine close to stationno negative hi room was quite small plus we weren t offered a room to have a relaxing bath in it was advertised as a deluxe room what on earth they mean by that i don t know bar area poor staff didn t know what they where doing a lot of waiting around at reception poor facilities in reception area the breakfast was really good basement room cramped pics shown and actual room are different with a queen sized bed in the room you can forget being able to walk about no place to put bags location was great no plug in basin which wasn t attended to basement room very claustrophobic carpet was dirty good staff comfortable bed good breakfasts the sixth time i m back but don t want to be in the basement again the beds and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable room had seen better days interior needs refreshing there was what seemed like animal hair on the bed linen so unsure if the room we were given actually allowed pets found toe nail clipping on the floorno positive small bed rooms some in basement with no views like a dungeon could only hang   items of clothing up in cupboard very crushed dining room no room between tables location of hotelno negative enjoyed our stay here it was nice and clean the staff were very friendly great hospitality would definitely recommend this to family and friends the location is great too easy to get around to other tourist attractions parks shopping places more than   yards from tube station and my partner struggled to walk bed up against window couldn t get cold water from tap adequate for our needs breakfast was good wet room bathroom meant whole floor would be wet after a shower personally prefer a separate shower otherwise great very clean and tidy modern room bed was comfortable staff were friendly great location under   minute walk to paddington station first time to london and would return to this hotel one of the two matress was very soft maybe the variety of breakfast is a bit short for a stay longer than a week club room type was really nice thanks to the staff for upgrading our booking after no room available of our own pick at our arrival really quiet area two different tube stations to choose from at a    min walk distance friendly and helpful staff eventually when i returned there was only one room left probably the worst in the hotel some staff were poorly trained gave misinformation the hotel overbooked tried to palm me off to an inferior hotel this wasted   hours of my time which caused me to change my dinner plans not a good start the small bed the hotel is very clean the double bed was very small it is a bad and a half in a double luxury room room had micro fridge and tea coffe but it is a very small room there was no iron or ironing board available within the room which is only a minor complaint situation of hotel was in a quiet area location was not the closest to paddington station for heathrow express but it was still within reasonable walking distance the staff in the lobby were excellent and very customer oriented the air conditioning in the room did not work well the staff were excellent particularly the night manager who handled a breakdown in our bathroom really well in the end relocating us to a different hotel with the same chain and providing complimentary airport transfers very pleased with the service one bed was broken room   triple room breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast the toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg acceptable room wish we could have stayed a bit longer during a rare london heat wave in july the air conditioning exceptionally good newly renovated rooms with spa bathrooms breakfast was the best offering we had the mattress could have been better didn t have a good night sleep i had a very good stay here with my young children we had a lovely good sized room not small staff are very friendly would recommend this hotel to families the club room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light the cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room the tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years the room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter don t believe the pictures on the website the staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when i had the ordacity to complain the italian restaurant up the street from the hotel which we had to use as the hotel restaurant bar and room service all closed by the time we checked in at     not unusual in london some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out i can recommend this hotel friendly staff comfortable beds and a nicer location in a very quiet area lots nice restaurants nearby close to lancaster gate tube station or paddington station where the heathrow express arrives bike hire outside you can ride around hyde park the hop on hop off bus passes nearby which we found a great way to get around the breakfast was exceptionally good the room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for   of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes the rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good if i had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it the unenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet again if   sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc overall staff were excellent quality of food was superior to most hotel restaurants with good price points wraps etc freshly prepared so able to accommodate changes room service curry very good handy phone was an unexpected bonus as it included free calls to the usa allowing me to resolve issues with at t not properly applying international adjustments room had excellent soundproofing and air conditioning especially in this heat wave bed very comfortable and bedding great reception staff very helpful graciously coordinated an early check in shower was awesome with superb water pressure and nice no water shortage compared to us so no need to recycle towels etc house keeping did a great job too the door staff could not do enough to assist guests very attentive and friendly sofa bed uncomfortable very unhelpful concierge refused to allow customers to contact alternative staff who could make decisions good location good price friendly check in staff after hauling   suitcases across london we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved after my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations the staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay location was really close to train station and tube good restaurants nearby staff are fabulous hotel was just a bit quiet for what we had wanted ideally it would have had more of an atmosphere around the bar or something in the evenings the hotel offered a free smartphone in every room that you could take out around the city ideal for looking up places to eat find your way on google maps or call to make a reservation bathroom sink backed up when very little water was run black mold on shower floor floor draining shower rooms a little cramped for space travelling with   people could have used more help with luggage on arrival good location restaurant a little cramped the meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims the staff was so helpful and they allowed us to early check in no negative the staff were friendly and always neat and tidy and universally helpful the food in the bar and at breakfast was good the whole place was clean neat and well maintained the wifi was a nice bonus the facilities are not that much there is no refrigerator or iron i reserve a room with   single beds but there are no rooms with single beds in the hotel very friendly and helpful staff the area is so quite the room was well air conditioning the location is not so far from the center on arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite i was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com however we were given   rooms on second day due to pressure most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood sujith location breakfast small room bathroom spaces in love with the way staff treat me food is very tasty and wide variety for a breakfast room is always being cleaned good internet service on higher floors the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bit hot but better than none there was only   bedside table we had a basement room which seemed a bit strange at first but it was so quiet and that allowed us to rest i think some bedrooms are quiet small but if only stay for one or two days is ok the air condition is very good clean and tidy room the staff are friendly and helpful lots of italian restaurants around and i found   local shops nearby felt the staff could be friendlier accent was hard to understand hotel is a little tatty and our deluxe double was tiny no wardrobe space except to hang   shirts nothing for dresses etc also was my birthday and my boyfriend proposed staff had been informed and nothing was supplied as a congratulations the bed was very comfortable no noise and a short walk to the tube shower was lovely and powerful the fact that i wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when i rang them before leaving i was told i could so then i had no choice but to pay extra i felt the staff was useless i liked the area and location i was in the staff at the bar was not really qualified we ordered a bottle of prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us   minutes later that we would need to pay as they are closing we got a room in the basement which is considering the price i would have liked to know prior to my stay no positive not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com the triple room i booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card i provided however the card is totally fine when i checked in to the hotel this cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel the english breakfast is good and the junior suite is quite big and on the upper floor my parents and i had a really great time in london as mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office   times i have problem one time gave room in basement then transfer me to anthor hotel one they cancel my booking before   then transfer another hotel one tome we spent full night without ac ang evening team can not do any thing staff nice but no authority every thing the have to back to central they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at   pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival but it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy   hour very close to tube this was practical the first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely i was over charged for two extra nights i just emailed hoping to get a refund value for money first room   was under the dining room and was extremely noisy scrapping of chairs on the floors woke up by the noise did complain and the staff who were very very helpful moved us to a room that was smaller but quieter so we had a very nice sleep breakfast was lovely xxxxxx the gym is in the basement floor at the end of a long corridor not so encouraging to use because of its location excellent location and friendly staff bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe staff had very limited english wasn t asked if i slept well on either nights room had a loud running water noise all night premier inn hotels are x s better nothing much likeable about this place the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon the bathroom was quite big location was very convenient nothing the staff were all exceptionally pleasant polite helpful and attentive the hotel was sparkling clean and stylishly decorated throughout the handy device is a great idea the room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet the room was hot and we could only open the windows about   inches we were going to the hyde park british summer time festival so this hotel was in a good location and very close to tube station staff were very polite and helpful on our first day we were up and out too early for breakfast so the hotel did provide us with a take away breakfast which was good enough and on the sunday we had breakfast in the hotel it was lovely good variety the staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed no positive bathroom was ridiculously small and tight shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink the rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean would not book here again easy access to paddington station and kensington park off main roads in residential area maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it great staff friendly and helpful good size room for location didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given i was staying   nights had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out the fresh flakey pastries each morning were great i hated the fact that there was no lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before the room was very small for a so called deluxe double the hair conditioner was never replaced no positive check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature i ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival also although i didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to i didn t see the point of it we were upgraded to junior suite all good nothing to dislike stall were all very friendly and couldn t do enough to please excellent service all round room was clean and well presented and everything you require was at hand we were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in very clean nice facilities as a family of three we needed the fold out bed which was really uncomfortable the head lower than feet and a metal bar could felt across back breakfast was good and hotel short walk from tube and many sites there was no plug beside the bed for charging my phone i loved how the rooms were designed i can say it was the most hotel room i ever liked i was amazed by the bathroom floor as it was heated so your feet won t feel cold they provide for each room a cell phone with free internet national calls and international calls for selected countries near by most attractions friendly staff i requested a tomato soup in the evening from the bar the service was very bad the place was empty but they took ages to bring the soup it was awaful soup the worse i ever tried just a red color with heavy layer of fat with no taste disgusting for dinner eat outside the hotel there are acceptable resturants around the area i asked for gluten free bread and felt happy that it was available the location was good specially to paddington station if you want to use heathrow express couldn t see a hairdryer but didn t ask so it may have been available friendly staff quiet location good value clever storage facilities in room convenient to restaurants transport a c in lobby was not operational during check in but not the fault of staff felt badly for them as we were soon ensconced in our a c room staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating we were first given a room on the first floor room starting with   basement requested a higher floor and were moved on night two to a room on the second floor starting with a   for the rest of our stay they were apologetic for not being able to move us on the first night but it was not an issue as we were wiped out from traveling and the beds were extremely comfy first room was nice but very small although the loo was sizeable second room was more spacious and equally as clean we happened to visit during a warm spell july       and they provided us with ice promptly every evening upon our return great perk to have a real kettle in the room good water pressure in the shower mini shampoo etc provided if you forget don t want to bring your own we brought our own power converter but underestimated usage the lovely ladies at the front desk handed over an extra no deposit required bellman so sorry i cannot remember his name from bulgaria was so incredibly nice he truly went above and beyond location an easy walk to both lancaster gate tube and paddington station a bit off the beaten track which was nice because it was very quiet a lot of chipped and broken furniture not much room in restaurant for a busy hotel television was confusing to operate loud air conditioning spacious room staff were polite at the location we booked they said there were issues with the room so we had to go to a different location something this hotel seems to do a lot looking at the other reviews the other location was just around the corn we but the room we were given was definitely not the size we booked location is good close to the tube and to citibike stations no curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room staff refused to deal with the complaint no positive nothing it was all very good the staff were very helpful and despite our very late arrival they ensured we had food and were well settled the room was good and very quiet n a staff very friendly room was a bit small but very clean and so comfortable location were just nice   walking to the lancaster gate station or bus stop or to paddington station super nice neighborhood bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double roomsno positiveno negative hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful room was large with bonus of fridge microwave which would have been great if stopping longer superb freshly cooked breakfast called up hotel to ask if i could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was ok on coming to the hotel i was informed i could not do so i would not have minded if i was given the correct information when i first called secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said i may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either i do not understand simple english or perhaps am too stupid to understand the halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring the handy phone was a nice touch no negative everything was great except the room is quite small for a couple very difficult to get around the bed the room was very clean and well attended to none i got absolutely nothing to complain about this hotel booked a club room big space very clean room great location the staff there is very friendly and helpful noisy old floor beautiful old hotel top class staff capable of dealing with all kinds of requests or minor issues delicious food and professional breakfast service i m very pleased with my stay in the hotel the room was just a bit compact fine for a solo traveler but i wouldn t have wanted to be sharing although having said that the bed was very comfy clean friendly staff and great free wi fi wardrobe space could have been bigger excellent choice at breakfast very friendly staff bed very comy reception staff very helpful would definetly stay sgain room was very small and the wardrobe is only about   inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach if only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was   of us for   nights this was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger bed was comfy shower a decent size room cleaned daily room and shower room very small shower room was pointless as water just went everywhere and had to use all the towels to dry so that i could continue using facilities lady serving drinks in bar was not qualified to serve as had no idea how to mix certain drinks convenient and was close to my meeting didn t like the first bedroom we were put in was in the basement dark and claustrophobic given a better room on  nd floor breakfast room was bit small and very warm breakfast was good staff very attentive firm pillows staff were superb especially mr joy who treated our girls very well well located equidistant between paddington and lancaster gate tube stations left my earrings behind called half an hour after check out the room hadn t been cleaned it was   minutes later but they couldn t find the earrings i saw them before leaving and believe they were taken clean tidy good location very small room the shower room could have been a lot cleaner as it was a wet room but very small the water covered the floor so using the toilet after someone had showered was very very slippery no positive the breakfast was crowded the restaurant small and food wasn t piping hot we were advised of wifi but this wan t available in our room as was in the basement meaning we had no phone signal either not all bad really good location but nice quiet street even though in the centre of london we had a really quiet room all facilities you would expect room was a little small and   nights was enough great location for hyde park concerts the room was clean and had everything we needed reception helpful and attentive rooms on the  th floor are extremely small you have to wait in line to have breakfast the space where they serve breakfast is claustrophobic staff is very friendly and helpful excellent job from all the people working there from the restaurant to the reception flawless food was good as well the layout of the room was a bit awkward otherwise our stay was lovely and we were very pleased with the accommodation we loved how close the hotel was to the metro station yet still tucked away in a quiet area when we wanted to go out for a meal or to sightsee we only had to walk down the street only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you even when i switched it off it was still really noisy the result minimal sleep not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day no positive what s not to like staff were friendly warm and efficient beds super comfortable proper hair dryer with no need to keep your finger on the trigger convenient location hot breakfast didn t look very good very pale scrambled eggs not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel and breakfast very limited wardrobe space pastries fruit were very good and fresh with good selection the continental breakfast was a bit too expensive the bed was extremely comfortable and the deluxe double room was just fine for a solo traveler although i think it would be a little small for two people i asked the desk person to order taxi for certain time but because tube down no taxis the person should have let me know right away unable to book taxi as had plenty of time instead i had to run with all my luggage and missed my bus cost me additional money to get next bus no positive breakfast too expensive they provided a free smart phone for use during our stay including free phone calls to the us it was loaded with maps and dining shopping information room was clean and very comfortable staff excellent quiet location great pub down the street the mitre check out the basement bar there mary s place character and history very cool close to the tube and paddington more coffee sachets and some juice soft drinks in the empty mini bar would have been good comfortable clean and quiet staff were very friendly and helpful got there at     to leave bags was told room would be ready for     when we came back to hotel at     was not ready and had to wait another   minutes size of room for  people and excellent location close to hyde parkno negative everything about our stay was really great the staff were super attentive and extremely helpful the extra touch with the free wi fi enabled smart phone which was available for guests to take out and about during their stay with free national and international calls was a very pleasant suprise and a really well thought through extra the room we were in only had a view of rooms across the other side of the building ideal location for us excellent staff attentive and professional bigger dining area for breakfast breakfast queus where possible if you are not an early bird this may be partially solved by recommending breakfast in bed for guests big fluffy bed modern refurbished look excellent service with bag handlers short way to metro trainstation beds are terrible lumps and tilting building is run down how can my score be a     now that i know that i m not surprised that i believed your reviews were good when in fact the property is terrible i was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel receptionist informed me that because of the change i was going to get breakfast inc when i went to the room i had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room i had booked i was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but i could check with her again in the morning breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in think i was probably overcharged as well location my bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security it took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious i lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management the management did not even apologies for what has happened i would advise booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour i liked the staff in the restaurant very warm and efficient the staff is unorganised i ve booked the hotel through booking com and i ve paid for the room in advanced the staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that i haven t pay yet which made me late for the meeting also i ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready bed is comfy and the room is clean the ac is adjustable which is very good   i booked a deluxe room a couple with   months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our   bags receptionist was looking and waiting   we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed i doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and i ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one   in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food i guess that is illegal and no one cares   there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink   next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after i spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child   i just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer i moved away immediatly   the hotel is outdated and rubbish   they took extra booking price compred to the one i see on booking with a difference of   usd nothing at all i am a frequent traveller and this stay was definitely my worst nightmare disgusting by all means kindly avoid avoid avoid things cannot be worse the room was slightly cramped there was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead good location and the free use of a mobile handy with maps underground free int and local calls fantastic the hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really i surprised from them they should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business bcz the price increasing more that   that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in uk we like uk thanks the hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really i surprised from them they should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business bcz the price increasing more that   that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in uk we like uk thanks bathroom was very tiny breakfast was good and staff very friendly i really loved that each room has a smartphone with unlimited calls and internet in london for your personal use if you feel like taking it out room was very clean and bedding seemed new or in very good condition the breakfast area seemed to be too small to accommodate all the guests every time we came there was a waiting time to be seated however well managed by the staff due to some technical problems at the park grand hotel we were rebooked to a neighboring property paddington court hotel we were very much impressed by the very helpful and friendly staff at the front desk the bar the restaurant and the concierge special thanks to sara at the front desk for helping with all the transportation arrangements that we needed maybe a little nicer view for   nights though no grumbles bed was ridiculously comfy i wanted to take it home friendly staff just a little outside of the centre but nothing a tube ride can t fix also they gave us a free upgrade to a twin queen room view from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building staff was attentive and jr suite was spacious proximity to paddington station was short walk we ended up in a very small room up many flights of stairs even by london standards and no one ever came to fix the tv because we were relocated to the attic we did get free breakfasts clean refurbished and friendly staff breakfast was good the room was very compact and the bathroom was a space saving wet room a bit of a squash for   people but manageable for a couple of nights absolutely superb location on the doorstep of kensington gardens and close to notting hill bathroom was small and with few shelves or places where to put personal stuff such as combs cream shaver etc room lights were poor no night lights for raeding hair dryer inside a wardrobe not accessible from the bathroom only to be used from the bed furniture in wood needed maintenance the bed was very comfortable room was quite big with enough space to move around it was also very silent no noise from outside or other rooms location was fabulous very nice area and near two metro stations very close to the park for daily morning exerciseno negative i picked this as a stop over for the heathrow express as reasonably close to paddington and the underground quiet and comfortable and much better ambiance and value than the converted properties in bloomsbury around the bm where i stayed before good choice lots of wonderful eateries nearby room was dark and cramped not great value for money great location just a short walk to paddington underground kensington gardens and harrods staff were friendly the room is too small especially the toilet it does not have a proper shower area and everything is wet after one is taking a shower the location is ok less than   min walk from paddington station the shower flooded the floor every time the basement room had no opening windows to a grotty storage yard the bar shut too early the room was very comfortable the shower was very good although it flooded the floor every time slight back room noise in our room from outside the staff did try to deal with it but couldn t do anything about it but did offer alternatives staff very helpful and riendly we were transferred to grand park paddington court and was not able to see the rooms i booked the court s room toilet and bath is small not suited for   persons as expected free wifi handyphone room was on the ground floor named club room indeed good in size but with strange dispositioning of wardrobe hairdryer location polite good staff especially at breakfas very good bed nothing really other than room maybe slightly small for   people but manageable excellent staff friendly helpful and attentive quiet area opposite a small park but close walking distance to bars restaurants and tube no negative had a double room which was small but well layed out and modern staff all very polite and breakfast was good great location for paddington station as had to get an early train despite   rooms being paid for in full in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what i don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid ridiculous one of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had we will not be using this hotel again no positiveno negative food at restaurant was simply awesome for an indian traveller the breakfast was superb complimentary mobile for the stay with free calling facility is great idea the room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both the corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen it was one of the most disgusting hotels i ve stayed at it certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it no positive the breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products i would suggest going elsewhere for a good english breakfast i was actually moved to the paddington court location a block away from the london paddington still park grand chain i appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just london short walk to either paddington or lancaster gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of paddington i would definitely return here in the future we were there for   days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday there was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait the staff was excellent each and every one of them i was moved on arrival despite only booking that day apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in the hotel i moved to was further away from where i needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere i d have chosen to stay overpriced and dissatisfied no positive everything was fantastic only thing that could have been better is that my bed was too short the lady cannot remember her name who checked me at the front desk was amazing full of energy and happy to assist me in any questions i had it was a pleasant way to start my stay nothing friendly and helpful staff who also let us store our luggage following check out the beds were very comfy even the sofabed good shower my friend s and i were very impressed i would definitely stay again we booked a deluxe double room for   nights spent two nights in a compact double room no deluxe double rooms were available for us we also didnt get fresh towels on day two definitely not   stars no positive there were no real restaurant facilities only the breakfast room and then the bar really good staff excellent facilities the hotel was changed from the original booking but this was dealt with professionally by the staff really helpful staff but staff were not allowed to kept the bar open after our visit to the shard so eight of us had to have a drink in one bedroom incredibly helpful staff basement room so no natural light couldn g get room service on one of the nights listed as   star hotel i wouldn t rate it that high compared to others i have stayed in staff were helpful and gave us an umbrella as it was raining heavily check in was easy room not available on time staff helped someone behind us before helping us hotel insisted on photocopying my identification which i refused breakfast disappointingno positive the room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel we had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty the window was also small due to the location of the room within the building the room was very good for the price considering the quality of the linens and comfort of the bed also the cost of the breakfast was included and it was very copious with all the coffee we could possibly want and a very good selection of fruits yoghurt cereals breads pasties eggs among other offerings all included in the cost i booked on this site and got a very good rate for a triple room as we were traveling with a child very good location near the train station we were leaving the next day and overall good value for the money the people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room this took too much time to correct when my daughter and her friend finally were given the correct room the one that i had reserved and paid for that was a relief bed was hard as a rock worst nights sleep ever bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it no breakfast included and already paid   pound to stay never staying again nothing not a good hotel the one next to it looked better and well maintained rooms are slightly small and there is just a little noise from the corridor because the floor is wood personnel is very kind rooms are very cosy and beds super comfortable breakfast is very good no negative our room was on the second floor clean quite and very comfy bed the shower was powerful and amazing can t comment on food cause we didn t eat in the hotel location was central next to paddington station and the underground we do recommend the hotel and may use it again in the future there is no shower cabinet but the shower is only separated via curtain the complete bathroom was wet after taking   minutes shower at check in they offered to give us a local smart phone and we signed some papers it was supposed to be at room but we never received the phone even after calling the reception from the room twice when we asked at reception they apologized for it and told us there was a problem but i found it quite weird the staff was really friendly for check in the room was clean and tidy the location is safe and close to the subway station poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before i checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling the room styling the booking was done for deluxe double room and from  rd i called them ahead to tell them i will be checking only on  th morning i land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself once it got unblocked they provided me a compact room where if you walk you will hit a wall when i enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors when i was not buying the story they provided me the actual deluxe double room that is more comfy the staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at during all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his palace location is the greatest advantage for property nothing springs to mind i didn t take advantage of the breakfast deal portobello market was waiting so couldn t rate that extra friendly staff and a free room upgrade best room i ve had in london wish i could have stayed a week location works well in a tidy and upmarket area would recommend the most expensive and also the smallest room with minimal facilities that we stayed in for over a month in europe but hey that s london consistent with most other hotels in this area for the price good location with easy access to paddington station and other tube stations and bus routes nearby short walk to hyde park staff were very eager to please and helpful with extra tea coffee items in room umbrella loan taxi s etc have stayed in this area several times before and this is a good hotel consistent with others in the area for the size of room and price a bit quieter than those closer to bayswater road some really nice little pubs cafe s and restaurants around the area away from paddington central didn t dislike anything loved location polite staff nice and central to explore london nice breakfast to start the day will be staying here again the rooms could be refreshed there s a different design on the photos than in reality also the airconditioner could be refreshed it was a bit smelly but fortunatelly we didn t needed so we could turn it off the location is very good in a quiet area five minutes walk to metro stations or bus stops close to hyde park the staff was nice and very helpful we didn t like the first room we get they changed it very quickly the room was very clean the cleaning was perfect it s quite well equipped the bed was very comfortable we could check in quite early we recommend this hotel we would book a room here again room is quite small helpful friendly staff comfortable bed and well equipped room liked the wet room style bathroom made use of left luggage facility made such a difference not having to keep cases etc with us all the time room beside outside air con which came on and off during the night which was noisy breakfast very expensive at   when you could go across the road for     comfortable room staff very friendly the bedroom furniture was a bit tired and the wash hand basin was cracked breakfast was splendid very kind friendly staff made it a very enjoyable experience was a bit a a walk from paddington not ideal when dragon a case friendly welcome from the receptionist and all staff were attentive and always greet you room was very modern and comfortable we recived a groud floor room where the windows where located above the staff s smokeing area the hotel blocked the amount of money coresponding to one night payment from my creditcard an after   weak i still didn t reciveit back good location nice room wifi access included luggage keeping facilities included noisy neighbour excellent staff they had a problem with my original booking but moved me to another room which was one of their branches down the street give us free breakfast the next day very kind of them clean and comfortable room good breakfast a socket for plugging your phone next to the bed staff was very friendly and helpful from answering question how to get to from as finding answers to specific shopping questions nice neighborhood quiet for a big city rooms with windows and daylight great shower comfortable sturdy beds not too soft separate closet and entree room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited london itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and i mean everything is so grossly overpriced the city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but i will never visit london again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant the area was quiet safe and easy to get to from paddington station beds were comfortable the facilities were very basic breakfast was expensive and extra the location is a little out the way and the food offer is very basic the room was very basic bed was comfortable check out was a nightmare the hotel was clean nothing negative to stay the place is wonderful the staff here are incredible and go above and beyond we had the best time and will definitely be back got moved to park grand paddington court and was allocated to the basement should have a choice of not preferring basement before location was good around     minutes walk to paddington railway station staff very helpful in helping to book a taxi to heathrow airport i was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered it is only when i ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology outrageous i strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings no positive the room for the price when i went through booking com i looked at the pictures under the room i was booking the room i got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality i m lucky i complained and they gave me an upgrade   pounds for this i wouldn t have paid   for it staff were friendly nothing to dislike the bed was fine breakfast so much choice and well presented the chef went out of his way to provide me with two fried eggs for breakfast my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine although this was procedure i objected to any swipe of my card i am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused the staff to be fair didn t argue i have stayed at sister hotel without problem lovely room breakfast is not very good especially the scrambled eggs were tasteless bedsheets very hard and itching skin was very rough afterwards for days please change your detergent chic modern interior design great location in paddington staff very friendly and helpfulno negative greeted very warmly by the lady in charge of the dining room this was our second visit in  weeks and she remembered that my daughter required gluten free breakfast great quality produce for continental and cooked breakfast very well trained attentive pleasant waiting staff a happy workforce working very well as a team excellent very attentive reception staff great welcome and we re delighted to be upgraded to a juniir suite which was very spacious with a lovely view of the green square very quiet i like to sleep with the windows open which meant i was disturbed by street noise in the early hours my husband is a heavier sleeper so heard nothing this is our second visit to the park grand it s just a  min walk from paddington train station the staff were welcoming and friendly the room comfortable and clean good choice at breakfast air conditioning awkward to control would rather have been able to open a window especially while asleep flexibility staff very eager to please quiet area near to lancaster gate tube and hyde park where we had a great morning having coffee and cakes at the lido cafe also enjoyed the traditional london sing song at the duke of kendal pub on sunday night handy for the   bus which took us all the way to kings cross much easier than the tube there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time i opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us the hotel charged me a   retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded no positive room was changed at arrival not sure how was the original one supposed to look like the one we got was a bit dated otherwise ok room size bathroom ok complimentary breakfast as result of room change location very good quick access to lancaster gate and paddington tube stations they dont clean the room very well i give them   from   the staff were amazing they want to help and even they ask you after few hours what happened and do you beed other help pemela and her colleague i cant remember her name they were very very amazing in supporting me menu and lack of room service at certain times some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door there are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside the building needs better windows to keep the noise out staff are friendly and accommodating breakfast could be better more yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit service was great there and in the bar cappuccino was bitter machine may need cleaning you need new pillows they need to be softer i was in jersey at the radisson blu and theirs were so comfy rooms are very small hardly any space to move every day   small bottles of water be provided there should be atleast one more electric socket friendly and helpful staff good chef and accommodating the room is very very small the room was not cleaned daily so far from the stations tube and bus it s for sure not a   stars hotel as it s part of a residence building staff are friendly and always smiling went for a club room badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away staff were polite and helpful location was quiet bed was comfortableno negative the hotel is very nice and not far from paddington station  minutes walk with heavy luggage the staff are very helpful and friendly they make a surprise for us after they knew that we re on honeymoon trip such a good memory it was a very noisy hotel we were woken at     by the people upstairs walking backwards and forwards across the room and could hear toilets flushing etc we were in the basement no other complaintsno positive i booked a deluxe twin room as per the photos it looked good enough when we got into the room which was hardly  m x  m i thought i made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with   cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back the room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse good staff but greedy greedy management and owners really bad experience cleanliness of the room and the fresh croissants silly question nothing i have never stayed in this hotel before it was easy to get yourself lost in westminster borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till i have eventually have found the destination it made my life so much easier as i ve never been around in this part of london before when i walked in to the main entrance i was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room my club room was beautiful but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery it didn t fuss me much though the cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was enormous i had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of merlot never to late to drink on your arrival why not the best part of the hotel was the breakfast i didn t like the breakfast i absolutely loved it as it was the best breakfast ever everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts the restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home they were so lovely and i felt very accomplished to half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star well done to all and be prepared for my next visit xx they must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in not a real negative but after a hard day working in london after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which i had to do since the signal was poor however it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter they seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all there was a small long thin vase with   real carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as i tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk i mopped the water with a towel btw the air con was making a racket so i turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless despite consuming several pints at the mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length i only got  hrs sleep but i don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs i was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms during checkout i wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it room   guys beware shower is good breakfast is good wi fi is good and free window had good sound proofing service in the bar was slow at lunchtime when we ordered a salad another time we sat waiting for someone to come and take a snack order very good breakfast had gluten free bread and explained all the available food for my daughter we checked in earlier than expected which was facilitated with ease the lady in charge of the dining area was exceptionally welcoming and professional remembering us each morning great choice of newspapers and reading material no negative rooms could do with some attention throughout especially for such a premium london based hotel should spend some money on renovating other than that it was all smiles rooms service food was bang on no negative everything about this hotel was excellent their is not a bad thing i could say the staff the room the location everything was excellent and best of all the price we paid was very value for money i cant wait to go back the next time we come to london we would pick this hotel again my room was in the basement if i needed to stay more than   night that would make me feel uncomfortable i should have been told during booking that the room was in the basement excellent location very close to   underground stations and paddington station for the airport my room was a club room and was spacious breakfast was excellent very good selection the hair dryer in the room was very strong perfect for doing your hair that was a nice surprise they assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one insects on on bedclothes they give you one towel for two guests the air conditioning was going crazy loud every   minutes during the night the room is so small it s hard to walk the location is great the shower was cold and unfortunately so was the room the little heater provided didn t work at all the staff were extremely friendly the room was clean and our junior suite was done up with rose petals and swan towels which my partner loved   min walk from pasdington station my room was on   floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside the shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet friendly staff clean rooms nice area around but heathrow express not far   pounds for a cab or   min walk we were made to move hotels because of hot water issues the mattress was yellow with stains if i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room i was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned the headboard was stained the staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control a second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge the bathroom was fine boiler broken in first hotel had to be moved to a sister hotel then they got my room wrong putting me in a single with a broken telly the bed was extra comfy street side a little noisy in evening but quiet after midnight wardrobe door with mirror on inside needs a hook to hold it open when using the hairdryer so close to paddington and lancaster gate stations busses also close free daily newspaper no negative the hotel was absolutely perfect myself and my sister came for her birthday and stayed in room   we couldn t fault the whole experience and wouldn t stay anywhere else in london booked via booking com and paid extra   to have the refundable option and to pay on check out however the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card also i had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed couldn t have asked for a better location to stay   minutes from paddington with helpful staff rooms are small for a traveller of     bathrooms wet rooms are awkward windows need to be double glazed as constantly woken up during the night with deliveries etc outside aircon heating doesn t really work that well friendly staff location small room small double bed not what we expected from a deluxe room breakfast was not included in the price we paid on booking could have got a better price from the hotel including breakfast if booked direct good locationno negative a great hotel all members of staff really friendly and happy to assist breakfast selection exceptional room well cleaned and supplied with bottled waters fresh fruit and tea coffee would recommend for business or leisure my security key to enter the door was disabled each time i returned which was frustrating as i had to walk back and forth to get the key activated staff were cheerful and helpful the location however was amazing right next to   tube stations and hyde park was stunning to walk run in the mornings no wifi signal first time room was tiny spoke to reception moved to bigger room tap in the bathroom doesn t work properly great location nice helpful staff clean room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room proximity to train and other services friendliness of staff flexibility in servicing room there was no bar to speak of there was a fairly spartan room serving drinks but it wasn t conducive to having a nice drink our room was a bit cold and the heating didn t appear to work plus it hadn t been cleaned properly the bathroom bin was full of someone else s stuff the location was only five minutes from paddington station the staff were very friendly and helpful the bed was too hard the bathroom was tiny and the shower was not powerful at all the only mirror in the room was on located on the inside of the cupboard which didn t open fully so the mirror was not accessible the fridge didn t work properly all my drinks were warm the next morning the staff were friendly and helpful n a staff were pleasant and friendly comfortable rooms very clean throughout on arrival we were told that there was an issue with the building and that we were being moved to a partner building which was fine the staff helped with our bags and escorted us to our new room the only thing i would say of the location is that it isn t very obvious that it s actually a hotel and there aren t any signs until you come up to the door no negative the staff really do go that extra mile from the second you arrive the food is fantastic especially the english breakfast we regularly stay and have never been disappointed the family rooms are very spacious which helps when you have cots prams to fit in we find the location great for walking to various museums parks restaurants the area around the hotel has a really nice vibe we always manage to find a family friendly little cafe or shop that our boys will want to go back to again and again the air condition was noisy when on or off so interfered with my sleep there was also a little bit of a leak coming from the shower head the fire alarm had gone off as well could have done with   room keys as my daughter had gone off to do her own thing and so did i she got to the room before me so had to wait for me to let her in as i had the room key love the biscuits which came with the tea n coffee bed was very comfortable there was a strange smell in the hotel and our room was next to a machine that make a lot of noise we received a piece of cake and fruit because of my birthday it was walking distance from paddington station the smoke alarm went off several times after  am just because someone from another room had a shower and left the door open too noisy the shower was modern plumbing quite noisy room not large enough to have a chair to sit in breakfast was additional and a little expensive located in a quiet residential area yet close to hyde park transport links shops and restaurants room was quite small but bed was comfy and bathroom was clean liked the air conditioning and wet room style shower staff were courteous polite and helpful staff not overly very helpful or assisting on checkin about the hotel or facilities great location just by paddington rooms were an ok size for london standard the room rate is too high compared to the services provided the room service could have been better i stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets the hotel is very nicely located it is very central and accessible to all other places of interest you could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if i opened my curtains i could see straight into the bedroom opposite the staff were great and actually made my stay clean comfortable nice decor and good room service everything one needs for a two night stopover whilst working in town just bring some ear plugs if you are a very light sleeper no window in the room comfortable bed we were booked into the park grand paddington however transferred to the nearby park grand paddington gate we were offered complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience the hairdryer was promptly replaced when asked as the one in the room wasnt working properly i didn t like the very small window in the attic room made me feel a bit claustrophobic would have been nice to have a small bedside light for reading i liked the comfortable bed and the small bottles of wine in the room on the first day the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them they took the trouble to show interest in what our plans were during our stay room a bit on the small side and pillows a bit hard i run a guest house in cornwall you could cut your bread bill in half we were given   large slices of toast with our breakfast far too much if people want more they can ask for it also there is nothing worse than butter from the fridge that is rock hard no positive top floor was really warm had windows open the entire stay even though it was   degrees outside the bed was really comfy staff were really helpful and the hotel is situated on a quiet street even though we were told we had been upgraded the room was quite small bed was comfortable room was spotless facilities good room with iron etc provided no control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats the room was very big though so not much of a problem the room was beautiful and very clean and quiet the staff were very friendly has free wine and fruit on arrival fresh flowers every day and a free newspaper delivered we loved the compimentary slippers and dressing gown everything was so nice from the t v to the shower it was a double and very powerful plus a room safe and brilliant selection of coffee tea and biscuits free shampoo shower gel body lotion and shower cap even had an emergency pack of cotton buds and cotton wool pads and a sewing kit also a hairdryer that worked well loved every minute the bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain it worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use a great location perfect for access to paddington and the heathrow express as well as an easy walk to the west end shops the room was small and wardrobe space very limited it was however perfect for a short stay and it was clean the staff were also friendly and helpful the staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and i was at the wrong hotel also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation when i got to my room i called for room service as i was shattered i was told by a member of staff that i couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated i went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time great location staff could do with customer service training i would never stay there again the location was very good standards rooms are small but price is low for central london club rooms are decent size fantastic location walk down craven terrace and in hyde park and kensington park within   minutes get tube from lancaster gate quicker and better than from paddington good hotel nice curry menu the room was a little cramped but somewhat expected for london there were problems with the water but the staff were helpful and informative in dealing with all issues bathroom a little small we were relocated to the grand royale london hyde park due to a maintenance problem excellent service from staff at both hotels and provided with complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience breakfast was better than the hilton s v convenient for tube and bus routes this hotel is brimful of history and has its own theatre maybe the staff could have introduced themselves by name on check in the create a more personalised check in the staff were very friendly and helpful to accommodate our stay the location was great within walking distance of the tube station which was great for our young ones little legs nothing to complain we stayed only a night and enjoyed our stay the hotel has extremely friendly staff the room was quiet had an excellent shower and a good bed no negative we were transferred to the sister company paddington court literally down the road because of broken boiler but in return were given free breakfast during our stay the rooms were perfect and comfortable location was good near a station and staff were great the room was a little bit warm there was a fan in the room but it didn t make much of a difference friendly staff and very helpful clean room and very comfortable bed the room was too small we paid for a delux double but it was tiny the aircon system is also too noisy hotel is very well kept and clean looks very nice their idea of separate beds was two mattresses   cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them the feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain no positive the maid service was a little hit and miss glasses not cleaned replaced sugar not replaced there was no mobile signal in our room we paid extra for a club room but didn t really see any benefit the room itself was at the back of the hotel with no view apart from a wall and the only upgrades i noticed were   pieces of fruit and some rather scratchy robes breakfast was excellent the staff were very helpful the location is convenient for access to central london and the rooms are well presented they are willing to store luggage both before check in and for the rest of the day after check out which was a boon rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment good location rooms were much smaller than i thought thought it was a  star hotel and did not seem like it good thing i got a good price from booking com it was a perfect location friendly staff quiet hotel couldnt fault it room was stylish and comfy staff were friendly me and my girlfriend are   and staff at places like hotels and restaurants can sometimes be less courteous because of our age but we were treated very nicely we weren t overlooked we felt welcome the power in the room didn t work unless you gave the slot on the wall a bang the shower screen was half broken so a lot of water went all over the floor location was great air con didn t want to work and room was freezing we had a little heaters but it took hours by the time room was nice and warm hotel staff was friendly and they upgraded our room to junior suite the location is good and close to underground we had a deluxe double room that on initial entry was dirty and in a poor state desk was broken and the tv didn t work properly not what i expected for a   star after our first room was pretty poor management moved us to a new room and it was a much better experience cleaner better view more comfortable room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem location was good near paddington station great breakfast staff very friendly and professional no negative staff were very informative and very helpful always trying to do the best for their costumers with a smile on their faces i would go back for sure a special thank you to diana receptionist she was brilliant very helpful answered all our questions and gave us good advices in what to do while in london where to go etc and all of this with a brilliant smile thank you diana as already stated there was nothing that we did not like the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff the excellent quality and value of the food there was absolutely nothing that disappointed us at any time during our stay checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good a little more milk in the room would have been nice we weren t really there longer enough to request more the staff were all very friendly and helpful they dealt with queries well and were attentive no negative stayed here with a mate for a night out in london clean and more spacious rooms than similar hotels i ve used in this area at a similar price point would use again no negative staff were very friendly liked the added touch of complimentry products we didnt eat at the hotel however the menu looked good and we will definetly try it when staying there again however i did not like how i went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and i went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things i liked the second room i got moved to and the food was very nice the location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre the staff were so friendly we ended up being upgraded for free the hotel was lovely and clean slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room room was stated as delux but was quite small the price was great got comp breakfast for our stay   days great taste friendly staff check in wasn t available when we arrived at  am however it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back the location was great close to train and tube stations and lots of buses and shops so you are never far from anything or getting anywhere hotel staff was very welcoming i ll start off with the location was good for what we needed but it was freezing cold in the room all night i had to call to ask for extra blankets at  am felt like i was camping outside had to call twice and wait  minutes to get an extra blanket the room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together there was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating the throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice noise coming from upstairs and next door we only needed it for the night so i guess it did what i needed to do but i probably wouldn t stay there again the location was great for what me and my friend needed no phone signal in my room a bit small room even it s compact double room confortable double bed nice staff amazing adsl the best i tried in a hotel   in this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in club rooms   no slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion   lat time i had booked a club room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence i chose the deluxe double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand however strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes i just don t get it how does it all balance out no positive the room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast i was one person and was charged for two people i contacted your office by email to discuss a refund for one night because the facility had a filthy room furniture in club room very tired worn shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small tiles of wet room floor cracked too booked a double room enquired to see if i could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with   single mattresses so declined that when checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain central reservations not easy to deal with on this staff lovely fruit and water in room nice touch decent location quiet area this is not a   star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy     room small they call it boutique but really it is just small the room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room no bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a   star hotel can afford to provide this for guests great breakfast friendly and helpful staff comfy firm bed fab location for transport links and access to londons parks shopping air conditioning left room cool even when set to   degrees thin walls could hear man next door snooring lovely staff fair size room packed in essentials we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on the matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable the second night in we were up watching tv and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work so overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great staff were very friendly and welcoming shower was also lovely be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large park grand sign outside the staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel nice atmosphere friendly staff and our club room was very clean and comfortable   mins walk from paddington station   mins to hyde park there was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small they start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint the toiletdoor is right by the bed rood staff in the reception both checking in and out the breakfast staff was highly service minded i didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature i didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms the bed was really comfortable the showers were good the staff were very pleasant air condition was noisy pillows were lumpy i changed the room twice but as you were full i had to have the first room anyway the second room was cold and the shower room floor icy the staff were great the tiny bar lounge was comfy wasyour details full name email address confirm email address password confirm password marketing information from time to time we may

noisy plumbing and a strange smell friendly staff good location and facilities great rooom size reasonable value for money just think i got a tired room the cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table not a big problem just poor design great location   minutes from london paddington very helpful staff and room was upgraded to a spacious club room which was a nice tough shower was powerful and beds really comfortable tv could have been a little bigger location was excellent short distance to the station and well connected the internet was great and so was the staff breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially everyone was very polite and the food was excellent i will definitely stay there again room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to  c room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall  m away internet was slow not enough for skype call staff was helpful breakfast ok however nothing extraordinary coffee tea set in the room i booked a double room but it turned out to be   single beds pushed together we found it very uncomfortable also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better the sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap i was really dissapointed when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet it made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table i reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it i really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this it s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle i found staff friendly and a pleasing atmosphere in the building i thought overall the facilities were nice and clean i can t say anything bad i work for a   star hotel in nyc the staff went above and beyond the front desk staff and bell men are amazing i really felt like i was at home very safe you all gave me   star service you are the best rooms are very small not a lot of space even in the deluxe double mirror is far from plug so could not straighten my hair shower door did not close properly too expensive breakfast was really nice staff are helpful the room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night the location was brilliant the duvet and pillows were incredibly comfortable too to all weary travellers i booked a four night stay at the park grand hotel in london paddington having just arrived from a long journey and i checked into my room and went straight to bed not long after drifting off to the land of nod i awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms upon further inspection i soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders i counted in the double digits after contacting reception i was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation by this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump the manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway the following morning i spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit the manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a   discount on the room which i did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways at one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that i may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury this certainly did put me at ease and i did not feel like a valued customer instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay i requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights as anticipated i was told that i should give   hours notice in order to cancel so i had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel i short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful no positive everything was suburb i would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time i go it is always great service i love the guys for room service as well as the doormen really friendly and helpful the gym was good but i would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights really nice staff at the reception the location was great with walking distance to   different subway stations and also it was very close to hyde park and kensington gardens no negative well located between tube stops for many different lines the room is tiny but well thought out to be well equipped the staff were really friendly pleasant surprise considering the very good price bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation i was upgraded to a club room told at reception it was a bigger room it was very nice room i must admit but not sure what a standard room size looked like to compare poor wi fi connection we missed a cosy lounge there was no where to hang our winter coats in the room bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush for a dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry very nice and helpful staff though very small the room and bathroom were very nice good value for money the bathroom was a mess   star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement no positive smallest room i ve seen in a long time i booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan far from impressed location was good and convenient for me our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing the window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms we had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue i came here for a romantic weekend with my boyfriend we were welcomed very warmly by the receptionist the room was really nice a little bit on the small side but very clean and comfortable so called deluxe double room is claustrophobic it is overpriced but what isn t in london in addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not location good lebanese restaurant nearby i was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take   days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny i wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area the locationno negative great location with friendly staff rooms are clean and modern but small as usual in london hotels lots of different restaurants in the area such as lebanese malaysia indian italian malaysia pubs no negative located conveniently close to paddington and not too far from lancaster gate comfortable bed room size was really small as stated but ok for   days would visit again rooms are much smaller than they look in website booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc two calls to reception with   min wait to get things sorted no positive a bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better the hotel was further from paddington than we d expected excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean   suite for just over   staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the indian food in the bar smelt delicious room service was very reasonably priced too unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat clean smart room with a comfortable mattress friendly staff and an excellent location there are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of queens gardens the hotel was conveniently located between two major tube stations we were due to check for in at  pm but they let us check in when we arrived at  am we really only used the hotel as a base we weren t there very much so i can t comment on the facilities or breakfast but i was very satisfied with what we got for what i paid room too small with tiniest bathroom very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card for security and other reasons i was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels close to paddington could easily walk to hyde park tube etc restaurants shops and great cafes for breakfast close by clean but tiny room everything you needed but cramped and my husband and i are small would be fine for a single traveler great wifi bit strange being asked for photo id to check in i hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck i had my driving licence with me getting a proper sized room with a real window at a good price just a few steps from paddington room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty i know this is not the standard of this hotel but i had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying i m sure it won t happen again nice hotel near paddington station no milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later clean great room ground floor and bright breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel good hotel modern stylish decor and spacious room very friendly and helpful staff would definitely revisit the only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows first the pillows are like bricks i recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them also the beds are not too comfy could be better i didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade but overall for the price i paid which was   it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for   you can pay a lot more in london for the same service staff are very polite and helpful gave us a free upgrade without asking which was nice pretty central and not to far on the tube for attractions like buckingham palace probably about   min train ride staff also gave us a late check out without charging us which we was made up with as we wasn t leaving london until  pm overall good experience this particular hotel has a chain of   buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey location was ideal only short walk to paddington train station and restaurants there was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road this hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room didn t sleep well will not stay again despite the massive problems the staff are very polite and tried to solve the problems second time i ve visited this hotel first time my husband and i were bumped this time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone you can imagine my shook and horror as   gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved my checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working so i froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why oh sorry to hear that bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff beware of the dubious checking in policy no positive disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting one front desk person sent me to post box at paddington while the next day i was directed to a post box just down the street a seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land nice hotel convenient distance from paddington station staff were very friendly and accommodating room was small but well equipped and comfortable only stayed here one night but will consider when back in london we booked this through a third party booking com previously to that i had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday they also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion the lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party if you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price how ever i decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves i had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise on arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over when entering the junior suite room i was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room i unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise i had been let down we then went down to reception and spoke with the manager sophia and explained our concerns of the room sophia said i can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week i explained i wish i had been told this before how ever sophia said i will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is kensington park grande she spoke to reservations to find out and sort out thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare i then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short   hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick we went down to reception and finally the gm natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us location of hotel and not far from station the air conditioner seems not to work because although i adjust it to   degrees but actually i felt less than   degrees and it was cold during night also i booked for a double bed but initially it was   single beds next to each other once i asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the   single mattresses the staff were friendly the room was clean and the bathroom was clean too the breakfast was really good but the restaurant size compared to the number if guests was quite small and everyone was packed to each other i was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor there was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak location and nice view from the room poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well room service worst one ever changing bed and putting same dirty pillows come on that s not a good service for london l emplacement le quartier this hotel is supposed to be a   accommodation however given our experience it can be said it s no more than   we booked a deluxe twin room with   twin beds when we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed we told the front desk about this they reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds they also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct we were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back first they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other park hotels when we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this so we had to accept the room anyhow they also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day more interestingly we made the booking in euros and were charged more than   euros more than our initial booking without any explanation when we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work the heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet when we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working ok and that we would have to wait to heat up that did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air mid januari in london that is not nice we called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction however they told us not being able to repair it until next day absolutely nothing poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good reasonable sized club roomno negative staff very polite and helpful much better approach to customer service than their heathrow hotel would definitely recommend       experience i used to visit park grand heathrow but no more after staying at the paddington hotel when we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination i basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room with tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by if you wanna stay near paddington in a buget this s good idea but to be honest i wish i just book hilton instead we were told at  pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but i wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet location and value for money room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option great location near paddington very friendly staff good simple breakfast excellent value for the price n a for the price paid     normal rate i thought this was a good value hotel plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities the room was smallish but well laid out i stayed for one night the location is great and if you re visiting london for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at paddington it would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc the hotel was in a nice quiet location just   mins walk from paddington station the staff were lovely and allowed us to check out very early for our flight at  am the room was a decent size and very modern with a comfortable bed no negative excelllent view out to cleveland square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room   good magazine supply nice atmosphere in lounge bar above all the excellent room and its fittings mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of   made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there both are fine just radically different the size of the room was very small no cupboard to put away clothing etc there wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries the staff were really friendly especially sara we would definitely come and stay here again because of her curtains as mentioned above great staff and value for money hotel was lovely although there were a few stains on the curtains this did not bother me that much however other guests may not be so forgiving no negative ideal location for paddington station and the parks and only a good walk to the west end weather permitting greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming rooms were small but well appointed lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good no public space to relax apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar we didn t eat breakfast but the food we saw looked very good the staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp we as a family enjoyed our time here for the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of park grand in around the same location its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks the bathroom is very small congested best value for money in a hotel in london within a walkable distance to oxford street the reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in uk as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout room is small but good i didnt had a bad experience i like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow overall i had a great experience staying there very bad and small rooms payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card but before that when i booked room they accept noting just location noise from everywhere in the hotel even uf someone walk un the upper floor or flush water in toilet breakfas is not good they gave us differen building becouse we whete told there is no water in the hotel well not stat again nothing extra charge of   on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception clean air con was very noisy in the night even when switched off could hear tv in the room next door lovely room open and bright very clean and appreciated complimentary wine water fruit staff were lovely and friendly lovely warm dressing gowns great location well deserved   hotel would definitely stay here again very compact room dark decor made room appear smaller location of hair dryer strange location good staff friendly helpful facilities in room good there was a double and single bed in our room for   adults there were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them the staff were friendly and helpful the room was uncomfortably small when showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell staff and breakfast were excellent air conditioning wasn t great where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror you had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug the mirror pulled out an angle to the bed the mattress was   smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time the shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark didn t like the fact i had to hand over photo id and the receptionist was unable to answer why when i asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why she took my credit card to confirm i was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any id and what if i didn t have id would i not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room not happy about this information being available hence why i requested the copy back on departure small bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages i loved the location staff were friendly and hotel was really nice at first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked it was a very small room but the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience no positiveno negative excellent quiet modern rooms air con great shower room service friendly staff and  pm checkout all for a good price will definitely be staying here again the second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in london when asked to call a taxi they arranged an uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate expensive for what we got comfortable and clean walking distance from train stations my partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber this would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend i believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a phillips screwdriver but who carries one comfortable well fitted room with particularly nice bathroom and shower comfortable bed quiet room and very friendly staff no negative we stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central london central line tube and bus stop only a     min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions considering the location it is pretty quiet at night this time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost we have stayed in lots of places in london but will definitely stay here again nothing i enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana i will stay more and more in that hotel again the staff wasn t friendly when i was checking in she didn t even smile after that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in then we cannot get into our room with the key even though our room was at the basement the room was open and spacious enough for two people it wasn t an incovenience at all we were given complimentary drinks for the room key incident the fact that we were transfered to another building   minutes away because of maintenance issues the room and bathroom are very small in size the shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard fairly clean rooms the evening receptionist desmond on the night of the  th to the  th of december handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at  am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room he apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late the shower and the door men disappointed that i couldn t cancel my breakfast but was offered a take away although i didn t have time for it i did take out an excellent coffee great location for an early heathrow express train i stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room the attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting located close to paddington station but on a quiet street clean and comfy decent bed decent bathroom friendly staff no negative the hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry we also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right the customer service was superb during our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital the customer service here was first class and i would highly recommend it i can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us i would defo stay here again no bottle of water was available the hotel provide the tea and coffee without water no purpose overall stay was very good modern room and friendly staff good location close to lancaster tube pretty much everything the dulux room isn t very dulux at all i could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about  inch deep there s was stains all over the curtains and carpet the bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around nothing too far from city central if you didn t know you have to have an oyster card for buses and your friend won t go on the tube no plug socket near a mirror lovely hotel helpful staff comfy bed i didnt like the way a staff member handled my cancellation of one night as i had to cut my trip short because of a death in the family trainees should be taught to escalate more sensitive matters if they are not equipped to handle them clean room good location minutes away from shops and tube stations triple room is small not enough space for big luggages you have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge great staffs clean hotel and just a few minutes walk to hyde park the first night i was booked to a tiny double bedroom   on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from    am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on the bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but i felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good overall i stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience executives club rooms were modern furnished clean and beds are comfortable no negative the fresh fruit and real flowers in the room on our arrival was really wellcoming very good breakfast and once again real flowers on table at breakfast really nice staff all very helpful and friendly letter of complaint already written small room with nowhere to work no shower as such just a wet room and you could not open bathroom door to get in there convenience of location nothing except the fact that room service is closing at  am i ve had a wonderful time at this hotel the room i was assigned was amazing and made me feel like home i absolutely loved it staff was helpful and happy i did not want to leave it s true that they give booking com customers the worst rooms right by reception the bathroom was tiny not enough plug sockets and the shower wouldn t stop dripping the room was also freezing and had to ask for a heater good location the rooms are very small and also booking com is very misleading the room did not have all of the listed items in the room the room was spose to be a deluxe but was more like a standard very disappointing and very misleading description of the room from booking com the staff were polite the only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower the rooms were a little too cosey small the staff were efficient and friendly the hotel was spotless the rooms were modern and had all the necessities it was a five minute walk to the tube station which was convenient breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if i had to pay for it when we arrived we were told we would have to stay at there sister hotel the park grand as they were having work done but they gave us free breakfast on both nights when we checked in we were given an upgrade as we were on our minimoon overall this was a great stayno negative very clean and updated good london equivalent of a us business hotel chain staff was friendly and always very helpful location is central with paddington station underground stops and food within walking distance the rooms were extremely small and overpriced we asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area very disappointed for the price being charged the second room was an improvement however still very small no positive the room i was saying was directly under the stairs and i could hear every footstep i didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance i would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel was very nice and well maintained at my arrival i didn t find the room even if the late arrival was written they just offer me a taxi for another hotel but i had to look for it they didn t suggest me anything no positive the rooms are very very small we only had   small suitcases and there was no room for them the breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if i d paid for it staff are so friendly and welcoming the hotel itself is lovely and quite grand loved the big tv on the wall in the room absolutely noisy air condition they booked a deposit of one night that has not been resolved again upon payment mini bathroom not possible to shower without getting everything wet no wardrobe at all location dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear they need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings they will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved really bad experience won t be booking again they also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club rooms comfortable and clean good facilities good location stairs our room is located between the ground and the  st floor so no direct lift access we had to carry our big suitcases from stairs gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages the room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in london location is the best being close to the paddington station makes everything a lot easier the room is perfectly clean staffs were friendly and helpful great breakfast no negative everything was fantastic the staff was friendly the room was amazing and comfortable and quiet breakfast was the best with a good selection of hot and cold it s the best hotel my fianc and i have ever stayed at and will stay there again when next we go to london no thing good on this hotel very small rooms we booked for room   m  it was less of   m  this not hotel but like one store of animals only location small very small room only an overnight stay very very compact not for a leisurely stay no space in the room or bathroom but did what we wanted it to do for one night sleepover noisy air conditioner lovely lovely staff we felt the location was a bit far out from the main attractions however the price of the room was very reasonable which compensated for the taxi fares lovely quiet hotel comfortable with friendly staff the heater didn t work in the room called reception   times nothing done about it the toilet was also blocked in our room called reception to be told there wa no one that could help us until tomorrow morning so had to use the toilets in the hallway nice hotel staff not hotels fault but noise from idiots driving around cars middle of night with loud car exhausts friendly polite helpful staff comfortable bed lots of hot water from bathroom taps very strong water pressure shower warm heated tiled floor bathroom small grocer shop literally across the road extra bottles toiletries in bathroom strong wifi signal that their system couldn t heat the room and i had to use a heater i liked the room a lot and the microwave was a nice surprise also having the complimentary room upgrade was nice the double room i was in was extremely small the bathroom was as well there is no possible way that more than one person could possibly stay in that room now i was there for business and i literally just slept showered and dressed there so there was no real issue but just understand what you are getting the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel and the room was very clean best of all the location near paddington station allowed easy access to heathrow and pretty much anything in london via the tube everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach the location is close to the underground nice neighbourhood the receptionist was very friendly and helpful good value for money i did not the like the reception staff as when there was a problem the resented the fact that there was one the porters where very polite and helpful bathing cubicle does not have sliding door hence we had to request for extra floor mat to prevent flooding very warm and friendly reception who assisted us in any way we needed the rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for the location was good and the staff were very friendly uuufhh where do i even start the rooms have no space you feel confined in them you can hear the person next door through the walls the hotel is a long walk from the nearest station the housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came   times between   and   noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though i told her not come in again the hotel should be   star and i don t know how they were rated   star perhaps it is self acclaimed i wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t a word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words the porter was the only good in the hotel he was so helpful and courteous i even gave him a tip look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals i hope also you pulled money ahead of time which i wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property location the first night we were allocated a basement room found this claustrophobic the staff who were excellent throughout moved us on the second night to a much better room on level  good friendly and professional staff in all areas cosy little bar with good service cleanliness in bedrooms and throughout the hotel was to a high standard convenient for paddington station and thus heathrow express lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed i was given complementary breakfast as there was a problem with the room that i booked and had to be moved steps leading from pavement to reception were awkward for a pushchair price of the breakfast lots of cafes within   minutes walking distance charging only     for a full english breakfast friendliness and enthusiasm of reception staff incl porters always helpful when it came to helping lift the pushchair up down the steps great room service room was not as described it was tiny in basement looked out to old ladders dirty curtains shower flooded floor soaking hazardous wet all round wc and whb this was not a deluxe room diningroom very pokey claustrophobic staff very good and helpful good locationno negative location the staff was very polite and cheerful especially some of the evening people with whom we chatted several times about the changing character of london they included shalaka cristina and rohan no negative nice clean modern hotel staff good pleasant and helpful good location close to paddington underground and station room was a good size for family of   had to wait   minutes for the room due to last minute booking booked   minutes before turning up at the hotel was offered complimentary drinks whilst waited for room to be prepared the room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting it looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so i had to keep the curtains closed more gloom i assume i was given the room because i was travelling alone but i booked for   people and i was paying the same as   people i don t appreciate being treated as a  nd class citizen i liked the location the star were efficient but not particularly friendly and lacked the personal approach except the barman no negative fab boutique hotel gr  location very near hyde park paddington tube station very helpful staff also the reservations rep mandeep really looked after my stay room upgrade plus wine beverages fruits in my room may be the restaurant bar must extend the close hours very friendly staff specially lucia who helps us with all our req great location comfortable rooms no negative i ve stayed in some   hotels in my life this one stands out due the hospitality of the staff we felt truly welcome and it made our stay so nice the double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and i felt like i was in a prison cell when i complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however i did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have   single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay   more for   nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it   single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is no positiveno negative well looked after by the staff nothing was to much trouble room was good except bathroom a bit small but hey who spends all there time in the loo would deff stay again got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere we were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the montcalm no positive the location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street there is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging the room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class not recommended to families due to small rooms check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast friendly staff fast internet without password and very close to paddington station we had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction despite our room being in the basement a new concept for us it was large and comfortable room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush the bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower you therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle the bed was comfortable enough the bathroom if it can be called that even honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower we had to put down   towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room it was really very tiny though we were in the club room   it is really convenient to get on the paddington express from heathrow walk down to the hotel it is just under  mins   it s in a peaceful street with very friendly efficient staff quick to meet our requests   lots of shops restaurants close by so convenient   comfortable bed pillows fluffy quilts very clean free wi fi   the bikkies everyday are a nice touch though if they had provided botlled water that too would have been good not so expensive for them i didn t like that it took   other bad experiences in paddington before we found this one situated in a quiet relaxing part of paddington great service staff friendly and helpful comfortable modern and luxurious decor smaller hotel hope to return great location i was setting in the reception reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at   clock you can get the key and other giving them the key when i spoke to her she said we have categories i told her i know you have categories when first customer came i kept quite because they are   but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait   min it will reach   and you will get the key after   min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster the reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses my evidence hotel camera no positive an unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet position next to paddington station breakfast is excellent evening meals are available very big problems with payment by bank transfer problems with extension our stay at hotel shame because hotel is ok good location and nice standard the wardrobe and the hair dryer were a slightly inconvenient to use but it s manageable for a few days stay staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean and quiet location on the whole was convenient incorrect payment my credit card was charged twice first time on the arrival send time when we leave when i found this i tried to get my money back it is already almost   days   emails written and still did not get my money back never go there again hotel location got a basement room with no natural light tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room good location good breakfast the size of a double deluxe room was small and i had rather claustrophobic impression no fulfilment of my preliminary request the bathroom floor gets totally flooded one chair only in a double room the same foods served in breakfast evryday and poor choice the location of the hotel is great there was nothing to complain about my wife had to recover from hip surgery before returning to our country this hotel was perfect for that the staff great and helpful i particularly acknowledge great assistance from tania at the reception desk toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped it was a short overnight stop so the rooms were adequate the room was tiny to put this into perspective we are two   yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury i ve also been in london a number of times so i understand hotel rooms are small in general knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it we actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room the location was good close to two tube stations one of them being paddington so easy to get around the shower was fantastic the area was quiet very little street noise spotlessly clean we had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it staff could hardly understand english and i thought i was in london but english is not the language no positive reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful i feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only   not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual london cabs etc we booked a room for   people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them i wouldn t trust them again with my credit card it was a lovely hotel very small from the photos looks bigger   minutes from the underground station wish the rooms were a bit bigger we booked a triple room they gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic it was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better but generally very claustrophobic rooms my teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space the rooms are small yet fully equipped with everything we needed service excellent staff very friendly and helpful rooms are clean the room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so i could not charge by mobile phone i changed my hotel to grand park court around the block location of the hotel no negative the quiet street central location beautiful boutique hotel room friendly staff excellent housekeeping who reacted quickly to requests for extra milk for the coffee very good value price for a hotel in such a location and only   minutes walk from paddington and the heathrow express the hotel also helped me to organise a surprise for my new husband in our room which was decorated with petals and roses the service is very personal and was very very much appreciated by us both tiny room and i mean tiny literally just enough room for a bed lipstick on wine glasses   days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only arctic and loud within   minutes walk of paddington station which has the underground availability no negative excellent location staff were very warm welcoming helpful was pleasantly surprised at the room size very spacious for a city hotel tea coffee facilities fridge in room would highly recommend definitely return terrible gym kitchen people smoking right outside this tiny gym with windows open into gym and terrible smell of cigarette very expensive for what you get and also not on par with other   stars nice location had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location the location to hyde park extremely small rooms though not surprising for central london you can barely move within the ground floor rooms either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children location is very convenient   the steep steps leading to my room   the lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut friendly efficient staff immaculate facilities with top quality linens etc the position of the hotel in relation to public transport upon check in i was asked to move to a sister property apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size they miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small incredibly dirty i will not be back i checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee i will not be back front desk staff were very nice and attentive i booked a double deluxe room here online but when i got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though i had paid the price point for a double deluxe room   pounds a night they then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional for   pounds night   canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here i felt like i had thrown a bunch of money down the drain the place was nicely furnished in a compact way no negative the staff were all polite helpful and friendly we stayed in a junior suite and the room was everything you would want if away from all home comforts really comfortable and in a quiet location considering it s london the breakfast was excellent plentiful and tasty would definitely stay there again they changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived they offered us complimentary breakfast the drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes good locaci n near several underground stations easy to arrive to tourist places deluxe double was a small room interior was back to the  s tv was small and hardly viewable front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as arthur daley no room for luggage bathroom too small   mins walk to paddington station and tube lines plenty of shops and resturants nearby rooms were clean good wifi reception was a nightmare when we arrived they put into a room which not what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service treated us like b grade guests because we had booked using booking com we asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time would not stay there again room was clean when we asked them to move us to the room we had reserved they agreed after a debate the room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic pleased with the complimentary breakfasts probably should be included for the price rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view very neat and clean good wifi easy access to subway station   to   minutes by walk breakfast was ok hotel is on a quiet street some of the stuff was helpful and smiling the room was a club it was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed anyone more than  ft   tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height the bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room the mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable   nights sleep overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth as a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere location we had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our   month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose the room was smaller than we expected to get for the   we paid for the two nights also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded all in all definitely not worth the money we paid the location is good everything is nice and handy to get to from this hotel which is it s only saving grace in my opinion unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room one small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights it meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases i would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well we were very impressed with the hotel and staff we were in london for our son s university graduation and were allowed a late check out for his room so that he could come back afterwards to change clothes and rest the gesture was much appreciated not the room type we ordered and paid for two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe location to paddington station hotel is quick and easy to get to but still in a quiet street breakfast hot tasty and plentiful all staff we met were friendly and helpful rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuffno positive a room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name this lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting instead it was sent back by the receptionist we had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price large number of staff lot of storage room due to clever use of space no negative the staff made us feel welcome and valued immediately were given upgrade and complementary breakfasts due to maintenance work room was immaculate and very comfortable very close to underground and hyde park would stay here again despite   days ill health notice the hotel would not consider changing our reservation to another date and our full nights accommodation was forfeitedno positive nothing the staff were very friendly attentive and responsive the hotel was perfectly located the house keeping were super in cleaning and responding to my requests the rooms provided were small we had to upgrade for the bigger rooms credit card details provided at time of booking via booking com was debited even though payment for the ris were made upfront this was only refunded after   hours blocking credit unnecessarily no positive small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room a c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working a c unit no positive the toilet was very small on the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com i would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking we had a junior suite which had a luggage room in it which was excellent the bed was comfortable and the room was neat and clean the room was awful too small very claustrophobic awful view reception is lovely but very deceptive as rooms do not measure up we stayed room   very dusty carpet coming up near door bathroom shower not clean bathroom so small you could hardly get out of shower would not stay again rooms were not as advertised although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down rooms were very small for the price hardly room to dwing a cat management were not responsive to requests for change had the feeling of being conned location was only   mins from paddington station good and free wifi rooms not facing street look to back alley and backs of old buildings one of our rooms had funky location down steps off the main hallway very small bathroom beds comfortable staff pleasant and helpfulno negative everyone was so polite and helpful a real central location for the sights we walked everywhere from kensington palace to leicester square taking in bucking ham palace downing street and mire ending our night with a great meal and vibe in covent garden can t wait to go back we had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind when checking out the manager charged us the difference for   people having a full english breakfast when challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband my husband asked he why he did it and was ignored a sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay the size of the room comfort of bed most of the staff were extremely helpful proximity to edgware road toiletries and facilities in room the size of the room is definitely smaller than the description befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk we rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable i think it is because of overbook the hotel is not very clean and at the  th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well the location   mins walk from rail station and tube station and the hilton hotel two tips our booking is not free cancelled one so the hotel charged all the fee before arriving no slippers the shower is good the room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain location for paddington station excellent the room had everything you could need for a quiet stay in london and easy access to central london perfect stay for a   night break the walk in shower as the floor was always flooded friendly receptionist showed me how to get to the harry potter studios bell boy also just as helpful the breakfast was good there was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor i was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours i travel extensively and this is the worst hotel i ve stayed at due to the noise factor location the experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception bad bad bad room service this hotel dont deserve to be   stars at all max     stars no positive the bathroom was ridiculous there was no tub or shower door just a curtain and a drain in the middle of the floor so when you showered water soaked the entire bathroom floor surface the staff was very nice and accommodating initially we were provided with two very poor rooms neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly the compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell the deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet upon complaining via booking com we were invited to look at two other rooms the staff dealt with this very professionally as we were staying for only one night we decided to remain at the hotel and moved rooms both of these were much more acceptable the rooms were incredibly small and cramped we struggled to even get through the door to our room the rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet the hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases the location is very good and is only a five minute walk from paddimgton station and is also very close to shops and restaurants the water didn t drain well the desk staff were sour faced do they not enjoy their job the deluxe room had plenty of space for luggage newly renovated clean quiet room good quality bath towels and sheets a   minute walk to paddington station tubeno negative the location was just fab nice and quite and with just a short walk from the park and center also i appreciated that the internet access was for free and that it worked very well more than two plug sockets and the bathroom door being replaced as it was in poor condition the modern style of the room some of the room furniture looked slightly worn out great attention to guests given a lovely birthday surprise of cake and a card in my room for the time we were there everything was good rooms lovely and tastefully decorated staff very friendly and helpful and breakfast was super no negative it was very warm and welcoming the staff were great and really went out of the way to help you breakfast was tops by far the worst hotel we stayed in during our holiday the rooms were shabby and in need of a deep cleaning good locationno negative staff were very welcoming and friendly room was very comfortable loved the smart phone in the room excellent for exploring london nothing lovely spacious room with comfortable bed the provision of bottles of water and fruit was a nice touch would happily stay here again very small room and bathroom there was no one serving in the coffee lounge just a note on the bar to contact reception location friendly staff there was no mirror heating in the bathroom fogged out mirror wasn t nice rooms are cozy and quiet breakfast and meals are great shower screen was very poor looked like a part was missing liked the room location at end of a corridor no passing foot traffic actually the room we stay   is quite small the location is great having an air conditioner in such hot summer is great no negative the beds were amazingly comfortable and the room was just the right temperature during a very hot night breakfast was good rooms poorly insulated from the noise of neighbours above and next door also noisy plumbing and ac breakfast was great and wifi was reliable room too hot and no windows that opened and air con did not work room was not too clean and pillows smelt good location and friendly staff small like most london hotels tiles in the bathroom were coming up and extremely slippery in the shower nice quiet and clean room great location they charged me   pounds extras because i pay with cash it is with refund but it took me by surprise no positive n a compact but everything you would need comfy and clean slept very well lovely fluffy towels complimentary water and fruit on arrival they confirmed   hours genius late check out by email but reception denied it had to ask it again on the day of check out location the bar i was treated very well by the staff especially a young lady called amalia who helped host our stay and make it as nice as possible no negative the personnel at the reception desk was extremely helpful and nice always willing to support especially the girls called gabi and felicia there was no heating in our room and it was freezing also a wet room when the website said it had a bath or shower awful room no positive n a brilliant staff room breakfast and an all round great find for me now i know it s there i will   return the tv in the room could have been better positioned really awkward from the angle of the bed the breakfast was excellent very fresh contents all was good nice large single room with double bed and an excellent shower great proximity to paddington stations kensington gardens and hyde park foh staff were not that friendly efficient yes but it lacked any personal touch or smiles the hotel was clean and easy to find continental breakfast could have been better and abit expensive for the little selection very friendly staff and the room was nice and clean and big the bedroom was the smallest room i have ever stayed in and the bathroom was no better the room was clean and the bed was comfortable no negative the location was excellent really close to multiple underground stations breakfast was lovely as was the room small but very clean room is beyond tiny smallest i have ever stayed in handy location for heathrow express which is needed to catch at    am nothing all good very easy to get to great check in friendly staff room very well set out with good attention to detail clean and very tidy room key had to go to reception twice because key would not activate the door we stayed on the forth floor so it was a bit annoying quiet location i had to change my room from the one i had booked i was too small the basic rooms are too small in size no negative we know we can rely on a clean quiet room and friendly staff each time we stay the proximity to paddington station and to central london are great housekeeping was very poor the room was not cleaned during our four day stay other than clean towels location staff and quality of the room the dining room was very cramped and there was little space in the foyer or public areas far too warm in the rooms good location comfy bed no negative great location close to paddington good for airport connection and to hyde park as well as a lot of tube lines very friendly staff wasn t expecting to be asked for photo id when i had pre paid for the room a bit odd the room was very comfortable and well appointed i thought the room was a bit too small and my partner felt it was too hot great bed and pillows lovely clean bathroom the size of the room the lack of tv options the limited choice on the hotel menu the comfiness of the bed the shower we had help getting up and down the stairs at the entrance but it would be useful to have a ramp staff were very friendly breakfast wasn t great girl at desk was very helpful carina i think was her name changed my room twice to facilitate my needs the plug in the sink was broken so i was unable to drain the contents no socket net to bed or socket next to a mirror bed was comfy room was warmno negative i liked the new look of room and would love to be able to get another night free from this wonderful comment ps don t forget to smile no negative my sister slept all night for the first time in months the staff were wonderfully helpful pleasant friendly we will stay there again next year no parking room really undersized for the amount of money paid giving a raw burger from room service to my pregnant partner nothing the musty smell in hallway and that the  th floor was actually across the street in a different building the extras in the room were quite nice room not clean bad smell in the bathroom as the time rude staff corridors in the basement had a bad smell aswellno positive the shower add no division from the rest of the toilet few power plugs in the room the air conditioning was not good enough no positive no power connection for the shaver at the toilet and was very inflexible for late check out even agreeing to pay for the same staff was very helpful   train station is not really near   room is small if you have big luggage you won t able to

place with a lovely italian and pub down the road close to the park for a   star hotel the rooms could do with a room bar fridge that was the one let down location amenities staff food no negative following an initial problem with the room the staff couldn t have done enough to help us i would recommend this hotel to anyone if there was a microwave and bottle opener in the room this would have been a plus the bedrooms were very comfortable and the staff helpful the room which was a junior suite was way too small for   people there was barely any room to move or space to put our cases no positive too small we had a junior suite but it was so small we xoukd barely pass in between the furniture very small bathroom price nothing very happy lovely on suite with under floor heating

restaurants and pubs near by room   is too small for a double bed and i would not like to have it again beds were excellent and service was great the size of the room was a little small but for the price it was good bed was really comfy love the crisp white sheets booked and paid for a twin deluxe room they gave me a broom cupboard with a very small double bed which i had to share with my

nothing were not told about relocation to another hotel down the road untill we got there comfort of the room and also how good the staff were small rooms for the price but not enough to complain staff were lovely and accommodating room was adequate and happy to stay again small bed more expensive than pricing provided by booking com noisy ac impossible to sleep bedroom with no windows in the cellarno positive room so small wasn t meant   b at this hotel breakfast is a nightmare no organisation in dining room location good very quiet some of the girls on reception were unhelpful and at times downright rude i liked the doorman who showed us to our room made us feel very grown up lol reaching room by stairs cause the left can bot reach my level without contac me they have to put me in diffrent cause they had problem w water room service stopped at    pm so we couldn t get any food or drink to the room location was good staff helpful with getting taxis for us i had to change rooms as there was no mobile phone reception on the first floor the room looked a little tired staff were very helpful shocking cold dirty stains on curtains third room change as hairs found in beds noisy plumbing and humming in room avoid at all costs nothing wardrobe very small wouldn t want to go there for more than a few days staff friendly room nice but a bit small the wardrobes were so high and in an awkward place neither i nor my mother were able to use them luckily we were only staying one night no positive staff tried to pass off a compact room as a deluxe twice compact rooms are very small and claustrophobic clean and nicely decorated too old building the steps of the upper level sound too much because of the floor material wood i stay at room   the breakfast the size of the room was way too small food was quite good and the staff were also very polite and attentive to all needs there is no bath and the room was too small even though it s club room staff very polite and proffessional room clean we would have liked a bit more wardrobe space and maybe a fridge we liked the location of the hotel and also the design of the bedrooms you could hear every noise including people running up corridors in middle of the night no where for young child to sleep in family roomno positive there weren t a lot of leisure facilities pool gym spa sauna etc the room was a very good size staff very kind and helpful the windows were still open and it is cold outside so during the night that is a little disturbing everything about the room very small bedroom more like a boat cabin not exactly stylish furnishing shower in the bathroom was broken clean quiet area helpful staff could be some plug points by the bed and the ones that were there could be higher for bulky plugs everything could not fault it the vents made a lot of noise through the night and it wasnt as clean as it should have b en location was good the room was so so small and not clean i requested an extra blanket and there was no respond from the reception or the room service location no opening windows a c unit was making a bit of noise brilliant stay ignore the negative reviews rooms are small but very stylish and clean some of the cleaning staff entered the room multiple times without even knocking to check if we were in the room the staff were all very friendly could better to have bathrobe and slippers in room close to paddington station hyde park is in walking area friendly staff and supportive the fact that the room was located at the bottom of the hotel i usually like some kind of view the staff was friendly and very helpfull didn t like the fact the bathroom was a wet room room was spacious and clean hotel was ideally located and food was great b floor is basement cold and damp heating was switched of centrally and could not be switched on in the room no positive the size of room for what we had payed for as it was a deluxe room and it was small staff and location very polite and friendly rooms are too small no chairs to sit on poor set up had trouble accessing the safe because of location set up cleanlinessno negative the location was great and the hotel was very clean and comfortable with a lovely shower very happy with our stay would stay again cot not ready in room on arrival check in took too long after travelling all day with small children and baby location staff and room was good sized the people in the room above us were having a party on their balcony until at least   am and kept us awake matress on sofa bed very lumpy locationno negative the single use room was absolutely comfortable the area felt safe if possible i would like to stay in the hotel whenever i m in london the same food served in breakfast everyday at least can they change one or two type of food everyday everything in the hotelno negative quiet location away from hustle and bustle of the tourist sights yet near enough to walk to a tube station or parks it would have been better with a bath and a bit closer to paddington station the room was very spacious with an excellent bed the hotel will not provide an early check in you have to walk for about   minutes to reach the tube i liked the location bed and pellows the toilet was the smallest i ve ever been helpful staff and clean hotel a bit far from paddington station the room was too small and cramped i requested for a larger room it was declined early checkin based on an advance request disturbance at night due to other guest causing problems that required the police to be called to sort comfy bed large room for londonno negative the staff in this hotel were friendly accommodating and lovely giving us a warm experience and a very enjoyable stay in a super location the room is so small and it had lots of dust the door cannot lock i also requested for the upper storey room but i got a basement room no positiveno negative nice hotel room was beautiful and bed very comfortable did not expect big rooms in paris so size was really ok with   windows bathroom modern and new with a great shower staff was wonderfull since reservation they sent me an email prior to my arrival asking if they could help me in anyway and also asking if i had any special needs such as extra beds i had a last minute health problem in the family and had to arrive one day earlier and stay for   night less audrey was wonderful and managed to receive me before and dealt herself with booking to change my reservation i sent a note to her when i was entering my flight from cannes to paris and when i left the airplane she had already sorted everything out they even charged me a lower rate as on the day i arrived the room costed a little less in this same day saturday june   i went out with friends and arrived really hungry at the hotel at    am and the guy from reception can t believe i forgot his name maybe hadesmi managed to open the restaurant and get to my room a nice aspargus risoto bread yougurt and a warm smile even thought riom service finishes at midnight really had a very nice experience at monhotel and recomend it not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is ok but they also noted down the cvv number from the back of the credit card this means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases since this is unacceptable i asked the receptionist to delete the cvv but she refused this policy should be changed otherwise good hotel no positive n a fantastic weekend with my partner we would definitely stay here again location was excellent and couldn t have asked for a better area to stay in was so close to the metro and all the shops bars and restaurants room was lovely and cosey and very modern with a classy edge to the facility the sauna is a wonderfull addition it s a shame i had to slalom in the cleaning staff halway almost filled with cleaning products also the proximity to the cleaning staff s room added all the noise to what was supposed to be a quiet moment maybe it would be a good idea to relocate their general quarter good location really good breakfast maybe the best i ever had in paris in a confortable and stylish setting everything you need is provided on site you can literally arrive with your hands in your pockets helpfull and attentive staff they have maintenance and i couldn t enjoy the balcony view i asked to be downgraded because i was paying for a balcony room while i couldn t enjoy the balcony instead they upgraded me with the biggest room in the hotel for the same rate reception not impressive building was under construction room passage was way to small room has also no space the room has everything inside as a full package lift wasn t working to  th floor as under maintenance room service dinners aren t the greatest excellent breakfast comfortable bed stayed in a room with a balcony room   highly recommend this room and hotel short walk to metro and arc de triumph no negative mon hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near champs elysees in a little street coming from l avenue des grand armees near the bus direct stop airport shuttle the metro station argentine line   is just   min away and it can lead you everywhere in town very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in paris the mini market le marche d etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need the street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building the service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful the room is so confy specially the bed air conditioning works great as well as the wifi to end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before i was really wowed highly recommended i didn t liked that spa and massage rooms were under maintenance breakfast was a bit overpriced  euro per person just for a breakfast just outside there are few restourants that had main course and dessert for same price room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after  pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound they gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free  g internet and free calls over the europe and north america it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in paris staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on it is litterally  minutes from arc de triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay   euro to get on top of it and you can see a paris from there its absolutely beutiful metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about  euro but it can bring you anywhere really nice location highly recommended nothing to declare the hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour the staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in paris no gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom also i was not allowed to then change hotel after i discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short i was then emailed far to late saying i could change but by that time i was already at work also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too absolute joke how you can get away with that no positiveno negative location is excellent and quite easy accessible for tourists travelling by car with parking in the vicinity staff diligent and responsive rooms are well equipped and they have a nice hotel bar the rooms are small but hey it s paris friendly pro active staff very comfortable bed great location in a quiet street proximity to metro and airport bus due to the tightness of parking you re requested to leave car keys with reception so they can move cars if necessary i was blocked in as the owners didn t leave their car key though the manager did manage to get round this the sound proofing wasn t great as i could hear the people above me talking non stop from  am friendly helpful staff could improve on breakfast items grapefruit juice was not fresh anymore scrambled eggs not enough cooked design hotel ideally located close to both the porte maillot convention center and the champs elys e area very helpful staff even before and after end of the stay room was small as only slightly larger than bed themed rooms with photos of american icons was strange for being in paris costly to be expected in paris though location was great close to arc de triomphe very comfortable bed very attentive staff faux suede wallsno negative amazing staff very helpful great location the smartphone is very useful we loved the place and the staff for sure we will be coming again no negative the location cannot be beat and the staff was superb they were all very knowledgeable and accommodating and spoke very good english the hotel is situated in the worst area of paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there the kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and     doorman in the evening the ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website no positive location not far from gard de nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the metro which was good breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere d cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better ice bar was a great novelty but at  c we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it also a kettle in the room would be helpful room was very modern spacious bed extremely comfortable shower brilliant staff very helpful the showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere the ice bar was an excellent feature the location wasn t the best but it was real close to the metro which got you anywhere you wanted in minutes so it wasn t so bad the hotel is amazingly designed the walls and curtains are fluffy what more could you want the staff were all really helpful and friendly we woke up without hot water and they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room however they noticed the hot water issue was covering the full hotel which unfortunately they couldn t get fixed immediately on a saturday they offered all customers   of their booking back which was great limited food available from the reception bar staff very friendly and helpful location perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go in paris and decor of the hotel was cool booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t the tv didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and i should just make do very sub standard cool room decorations were very gaudy worst hotel ever awful location bar and restaurant closed all   days we were there non existent receptionists and tv reception was variable had junior suite but no robes no proper shower either room was clean no proper light over bathroom mirror bathroom open to room nightclub feel to corridors floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard the breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast the corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur the bed was very comfortable i didn t feel very comfortable around the area and the fact you could hear people outside the room most of the night as well was not the best the hotel overall was very nice very bad experience as i lost more than   euros it was stolen from my bag i just knew when i arrived back the hotel is good expect staff at counter and the room service very bad experience as i lost more than   euros from my bag that i kept inside room it was although my mistake that i should not left money in my bag as i know room cleaning people will come and might take the money toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room room was spacious bed very comfortable interesting building very bad area in the station neighborhood staff couldn t speak english so it was extremely difficult to communicate lack of communication among staff which forced me to repeat things to each member of staff it took me   hr to check out only the room decor we didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night wlking in the day is fine but i would be more inclined to take a taxi at night there were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking this is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel the hotel is a great boutique hotel the rooms are great and the hotel staff where helpful and friendly fitness club was out of order which was the only reason i booked this particular hotel for the price the staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our   day stay and there are no parks nearby for running there were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet there was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week the staff were nice and it s a very funky hotel with a night club decor but sort of well done the ice bar is a must hotel closing for refurbishment most of the staff being sacked future of the hotel likely to be expensive with new staff they are losing their best asset breakfast reasonable in price and good quality comfy bar good staff some of the ground floor spaces needed a facelift which they are now undergoing amazing victorianlandmark hotel in the heart of the city with one of the kindest and most attentive staffs i have encountered hotel facade works hotel location near the city centre and transportation free wifi with good signal room comfort coffee tea and cookies courtesy the bedrooms are very tired and a bit grubby looking air con and extractor were broken the resection and outside of the building were beautiful and the staff were polite and very helpful hotel not up to scratch in certain areas it will close for refurbishment shortly so hopefully it will sort a few problems out location very good nice architecture good staff under going renovation which i wasn t made aware of room comfortable but tired location excellent tube round the corner and easy walk to covent garden staff were friendly and helpful place is really old cramped and dirty even dirtier than london in general there was a smell in the room i was initially put into and another smell in another room i asked for no positive   the hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized   it was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience   the in room breakfast was not on time i was almost late on the morning   very old decorations not clean enough   it was definitely not worth for the price the location is great just near russel sq station noise from the air conditioning units we may not be able to afford a room once the improvements are completed the location was superb and the staff friendly and helpful there are improvements currently underway but it had little impact we had a with no view and noise from the air conditioning but that was probably a reflection on the price we paid no negative room was clean hotel has lots of character breakfast was good lots of selection left my smartphone in room on check out i was at airport before i noticed that it was missing staff found the phone and sent it to me thank you miles for your concern and prompt action we had no complaints whatsoever hotel russell is a beautiful historic hotel with amazing public rooms but also very attractive comfortable guest rooms we ll be back double room was small and in need of a freshen up also woken up a  am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want great looking hotel both inside and outno negative all staff especially miles on reception were professional and friendly and the rooms were well kept lounge and bar arrears felt comfortable and relaxing sink in bathroom extremely small we were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before in fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in hong kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out would appreciate some feed back on this matter enjoyed room service twice very quick and delicious food comfy bed lovely breakfast nothing at all awesome historic building conveniently located next to the underground staff specifically miles was incredibly friendly and made our stay an experience i have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years the rooms are getting tired and worn the front desk staff are indifferent i tried to break a   note at front desk so i could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants major exterior renos going on outside hotel i hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well i think it is time that i try another hotel the location of the hotel is amazing you are easy walking distance to all of the london attractions and to the city the old doorman has been here for years a welcoming face for sure no negative staff are extremely friendly and obliging aircon in my room didn t work so they immediately arranged a move and upgrade location is brilliant free wifi breakfast was good and convenient a great place to stay light outside of the door shines through spy hole and the door frame unable to turn it off crazy i am a returning client make more of your existing client base door staff excellent reception staff excellent i asked for a quiet room and that was what i was given astonishing most london hotels would have ignored my request had to go to local shop for fresh milk as not available from housekeeping staff one awful sandwich in the bar shame really as other food very good beautiful building great location and really helpful staff the first room we were allocated had a musty smell to it but we were efficiently moved across to another room with no bother at all some areas need updating but this was already underway in some parts of the hotel shower was very noisy plenty of choice for breakfast with very nice tea and coffee full english and continental available with fresh croissants and pastries also location was perfect as it was very close to tube station but also within walking distance of the major shops and attractions and opposite russell square gardens staff were very pleasant and helpful i had requested a quiet room given room on the  th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on requested room change given room on  nd floor windows blocked out no daylight extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between  am until  pm worst sleep ever old noisy air conditioning system also hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this when booking i booked for   nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as i had made the booking through booking com no positive the bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed both my husband i had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us the hotel was clean and the room was well knitted out shower brilliant the staff were lovely see adjacent box breakfast was not fresh potatoes the standard fried triangles were stale and over fried pastries were not fresh and gave off a stale taste i m comparing the russell hotel breakfast buffet to that at the euston hilton hotel at upper woburn which was excellent fabulous service gorgeous old world charm modem spacious room loved having such a helpful doorman every day after a busy day of sightseeing how wonderful to be greeted by cold water infused with fresh fruit at the reception counter the room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the victorian style we liked work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times we generally loved this hotel we d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in bloomsbury before so we thought we d try staying there the location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from heathrow was do able the hotel s victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room the staff was very helpful no negative the hotel russell is a rare survivor of a bygone era few hotels today can match the historical opulence of the russell hotel it is worth a visit if only to have a drink at the bar room and hotel generally were a little dark pillow was lumpy decor and furniture a little tired location perfect and delightful area not too busy lovely park opposite nice restaurants and bars in the area character of hotel is beautiful with lovely marble and tiled features staff polite and helpful our room was large with nice bathroom would definitely stay there again seems like room would be very hot in summer air conditioning did not cool room very much when i used it but not a real issue in june this is a large classic hotel interior by the man who did the decorating of the titanic located very close to the tube makes it great for getting around room much larger than most in london right across street from park near british museum the rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings great central location and a monument to victorian grandeur on the architecture of the hotel the hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance the sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel the television was very small and dated the staff were particularly friendly and helpful it was our  th wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in we were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and   delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day this was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit n a staff were really friendly and they catered to all our needs everything was very clean our requests were all fulfilled which made this an extra special stay for a birthday i couldn t fault a single thing we had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work an engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience great location for what we needed beautiful exterior and lobby and bar areano negative hotel russell is my preferred hotel in london the piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel russell station and then you are in the central part of london close to the british museum and many historic sites the hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations the only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken very clean and comfortable good location breakfast was very good fresh food we chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money the windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment the location was good and it is easy to get to the main attractions in london from there after checking out i left my luggage at the concierge however when i returned i had to wait or over   minutes before i got my items as the concierge was elsewhere this resulted in me nearly missing my train good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos take note not all rooms have the old grand baths hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses the tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid i d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge great location friendly staff lovely room although a bit on the small side for a twin room very lovely building with real character gorgeous stair case and chandelier there was no water in the room and we had to pay   for two bottles from the bar the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and made our stay work like clockwork likewise the building works had no negative impact on our stay the hotel is well located for both euston and st pancras station and of course the british museum we couldn t shower bath the cold tap fell off bathroom very cramped would be better off with just a shower in there breakfast was awful dried up bacon mushrooms eggs weren t any better drinks very expensive we did complain and were given a refund beds were comfortable room was adequate for our needs the air conditioning was pretty useless and didn t cool down the room as it was located on the floor and not on the ceiling and it was very warm in the room beautiful hotel and in a good location for the eurostar room was a good size located on the top floor overlooking the park staff were friendly and helpful they charge a fortune for breakfast use the caf s surrounding the park instead cheaper and nicer for working not very good comfort the desk and chair in the room is very uncomfortable to sit and work with comfortable bed and great location friendly staff rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning the hotel was designed by the person who designed the titanic and the downstairs and architecture was incredibly grand the rooms and bathrooms were pretty small bernard the concierge was excellent breakfast was horribly overpriced we were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed no positive the fire drill that takes place every monday at     pm after a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off the building is beautiful and the staff were helpful and friendly euston station is a   minute walk away and oxford st shopping close by nothing really rooms small compared to previous stays but comfortable with plenty of amenities we did move one room as there was no door chain and air conditioner very noisy staff are incredibly helpful and pleasant concierge had the doorman walk our luggage to the underground and a restaurant designed by the designer of the titanic no negative i highly recommend this hotel excellent value for money in central london the architecture and the decor is remarkable my room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows and the bed was very comfortable in addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the hotel manager and it was great to see the receptionist cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism no negative an incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room and cohen the receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite excellent hotel the bed was extremely uncomfortable the mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it i woke up with back pains as well we ended up switching hotels because of it there was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that personally that didn t really bother me the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly the room was relatively big so i had space to move around the staff is super friendly and the location is perfect the tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus for example you might think that being close to kings cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least   minutes and that s if you get the exit right switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location it s also located in front of russel square park which is very nice not unique to the russell but i dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of     and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill no positive rooms very tired and badly in need of refurbishment air conditioning did not work bathroom very small lifts very small reception staff were very helpful breakfast was good the shower didn t work properly the bathroom was tiny and it wasn t easy to get out of the shower a shower cap would have come in useful the location i loved this place they are renovating some of the hotel and so it will be even nicer the location from st pancras was perfect we walked from the station to the hotel in less than   minutes great access to the tube hotel is very tired we had a twin bedded room which faced an interior courtyard windows very dirty outside tiles in the bathroom needed grouting room service extremely limited good location no negative location is amazing for travel from heathrow and to visit most sites in london very near a tube station on one of the best tube lines coffee shops beside the hotel the shower leaked under the door into the bedroom and the bathroom floor was also very slippery the bedroom was far too hot and couldn t be cooled down excellent breakfast comfortable room wonderful wide staircase no negative the bedroom suite was luxurious quiet and comfortable and the bathroom with it s twin sinks and sit down shower was absolutely wonderful i couldn t fault it and i am extremely fussy my room was on the road side of the building extremely noisy with ambulances racing down the road dining room not open when on one night i stayed i was not informed of this on checking in very interesting decor good location great little restaurant around the corner no negative always excellent reception staff who try hard to offer quiet rooms i always feel welcome and that s why i return it s very good value for the quality some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby great ormond street hospital disturbing in the nighttime it is a beautiful old hotel a bit worn down but with distinct charm no shower cap shower gel or conditioner insufficient milk and coffee air conditioning so noisy that it was unusable fridge not working food in restaurant very average quality drinks very expensive threadbare carpet on stairs no positive friendly concierges were helpful but weren t actually familiar with many of the sites or transports inquired after they went online to find out excellent desk and concierge service gracious and friendly and provided good service location is right at the picadilly tube line and easy walking to the circle line i took the picadilly tube to heathrow and avoided traffic to get there i rolled my suitcase around the corner took the lift to the platform and didn t have to move again until reaching heathrow ok one short stairway that s convenient nothing it was a lovely but small room in london with a good view but had everything we needed would definitely stay again perfect location for our morning spent at the british museum building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel grandiose decor inside more choice for room service both food and drink to suit todays traveller more tv film choices as currently limited the staff were excellent professional and friendly we received an unexpected free upgrade and champagne and cake for our celebration just wonderful the hotel russell is one of our favourite london hotels but our room this visit was quite small and there was no view at all from the window but it was very good value we booked quite late and it was a busy weekend breakfast is excellent and the staff are superb got a room over the hallway from major refurbishment that woke us up in the morning got the room changed with very little fuss location is superb underground next door classy hotel the pillow too big for me therefore my nights were uncomfotable i was obliged to use the red decorative cushion the bed was comfortable the concierge was pleasant and very helpful l it s a tired old building we had problems with plumbing a c didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up windows didn t open there is no business center to print airline tickets overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost staff very friendly and helpful super location close to three underground stops shopping and restaurants very conveniently nearby lobby is beautiful like hotels of this vintage breakfast room and food were excellent and staff very attentive to our whims no negative clean comfortable room the staff were helpful and friendly the hotel is in a fantastic location i couldn t have asked for more i just wish i had been staying longer we spend   nights in three different rooms we were moved twice due to very very poor quality rooms this is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover i would suggest for the price to stay at the russell you could do much better elsewhere the staff we very helpfulno negative old edwardian charm and location the dining room and other public spaces were done by the interior designer of the rms titanic and the dining room is an almost exact copy the room   was not up to the standards of a     star hotel mattress too hard not enough wardrobe space noisy bathroom would have been ok in   the location and the friendliness of the staff air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed also the bathroom was very compact quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror the staff were lovely and helpful and the reception area looked impressive on arrival throughout the hotel the decor classy the room was lovely and quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable good location with easy reach to train station tube and restaurants i m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot the sink in the bathroom was very small being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and i was awakened early it was very hot in london this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times i was also unhappy that i d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when i returned on sunday evening that money had disappeared i know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either the staff were excellent the bloody mary s in the bar were perfect and the location was ideal i wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast is it separated by race or rank of room we are japanese i hope not this is the first hotel which the staves designated our table and the tables we were shown were not so comfortable besides i would like to request to improve the breakfast and about our room honestly i regreted not asking to change another room i wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if i paid extra fee because it was my mother s last   days of staying in london some of staves talked to us in japanese so we felt welcome needs a bit of tlc but overall a very nice hotel noisy aircon generators outside the room view was actually of them but it is london and we paid around   for just bed no breakfast which in london is reasonable great position for us from st pancras and also for the theatres restaurants etc lovely lighting and staircase in the foyer the room was tatty and well worn with gaps in the fitting of the windows and a really very poor standard of maintenance the location and the grandeur of the stairway the room i booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small the package i booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely the one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot luckily i don t get up in the night but if i had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight really liked the hotel and location no negative a lovely magnificent old building and well kept hotel in the heart of london great staff great room a good bed and a nice breakfast i will return  st room too noisy opposite   pubs  nd room plumbing problem no refrigerator  rd room wifi signal too weak in room no refrigerator location convenient on airport tube line bed and pillows comfy the rooms on the  th floor are very small and unless your  ft   you ll have to squat to get underneath the shower head great location and reception area small small room first room air did not work however they did change our room the next day the staff especially bernard at the concierge the hotel is old and gorgeous happy with everything the staff went out of their way to accommodate us during a difficult period of health which without our anniversary break would not have been able to go ahead and the little anniversary suprise made it even more special more shelf room needed in the bathroom was my only critism lovely comfy sleep staff brilliant and more than helpful beautiful bar stunning building and interesting titanic connection very reasonably priced meals room sheets could ve been cleaner service was excellent from the start great location and central to everything the underground is around the corner breakfast was good with a variety to choose from comfortable beds and nice view from room nothing continental breakfast was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and problem free train station was round the corner and a small shopping centre too me and my new fianc e had an amazing stay and we will go back building work during the day but this can t be helped cafe in russell square park just over the road serving breakfast at a fraction of the price and in a nice setting  nd floor noise from street level but i can deal with that bed is uncomfortable old spring not a good night sleep as a result shower pressure was not great overall the particular room we had could be the exception needs updating but quirky room was decent size the bar was alright cosy and we didn t have any problems getting seats there was nothing i did not like i was really impressed with my room it was light and airy i felt welcomed at all times i loved being able to curl up in the bar with a book i felt very comfortable and safe as a sinlge woman drilling started very early in the daytime for the ongoing refurbishment all staff were extremely polite friendly and welcoming russell square underground station just around the corner pleasant park with fountain and cafe right across the road i was advised that the restaurant was closed on sundays which was a pity as the friend i was meeting and i would have liked to eat there the only thing missing was a bathrobe i d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good i booked a room only deal so didn t use the restaurant for breakfast however otherwise i loved my room it was clean comfortable and atmospheric the staff were polite and helpful altogether a lovely old hotel please keep it that way how to get cold water in the bathroom is and remains a mystery breakfast variety of fruits and kinds of breads is limited room and bathroom very nice and decent size horrible mattresses sprung chairs pathetic bathroom supplies staff were grumpy and poorly trained interiors are depressing good location w tube busses and british museum concierge staff were excellent the value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a  star hotel we were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple in a   star hotel that is far from acceptable after complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room the images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal a disappointing experience the location never got washcloths proximity to the tube beautiful exterior and architecture very friendly staff nice big bathroom in our room good neighborhood for dining  nd bed in our double accommodation was a sleeper sofa and the mattress was sheer torture breakfast was fab bernard concierge took very good care of us no negative the staff are very pleasant and accommodating and the location is great overlooking the square it has a wonderful old time feel without being antiquated check in was terrible we arrived about   pm and it took us     hours to get the room it s very beautiful building location is also not bad stuff was trying their best but the check in was so badly organized that it s hard to get reed of the biter taste quite some noise came from machinery in the courtyard through closed windows even at night the building is appropriately glamorous for a hotel in london s centre the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was delicious and offered the whole variety of a full monty no negative breakfast was excellent location perfect to get anywhere in london beds were a little hard as were the pillows and the towel rack was very difficult to put towel back as i am short and it was tucked up in bathroom niche room service menu is a little limited having said that there are numerous eateries on your doorstep parking not on site but close by location is great has a very pleasing ambience and a cosy feel to the hotel staff were welcoming and very helpful bar prices a bit steep but did sort of expect it being such a classy hotel the staff really looked after us and especially made a fuss of our mum who s  th birthday celebration was the reason for our visit thank you not enough towel hooks for two people nowhere to place tooth brush and toiletries near sink staff were all very attentive and polite special thanks to bar staff for treating us so well the building is old and the decor shabby what you see on the booking site isn t the room you get our room was small carpet worn windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny tv location is good and close by to a tube station could have done without a visit from a man to check the blinds once we d checked in the roman blind didn t work very well room was slightly smaller than one would expect for the money and a little tired all the common areas the bar and the staff were all excellent room rather hot airless window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective only one set of shampoo soap etc great staff wonderful historic hotel in a perfect location comfortable room epensive unless you get a special fare magnificient hotel fantastic location beautiful architecture nice bar great english breakfast in a gorgeous stylish room bathroom a little small   but they are updating rooms shower did not work properly kept going hot and cold it may have had something to do with the workmen next door but we managed very comfortable room staff very good and excellent location always stay here the biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of english and this was hugely frustrating not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too it was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and i do think the language barrier plays a big part in this for this reason alone i sadly will not be coming back location is great and nice and central stayed in single rooms and they were okay comfortable and quiet bar was nice and cocktails were lovely the rooms are in the process of being refurbished but there were holes in the carpet in my room breakfast was wonderful can t beat the location the prices in the bar were very high the dinner menu was mainly just pub food the long walk to the bedroom from the elevator the bedroom was small but nicely furnished and well appointed the bar was very comfortable and the service was excellent very small bathroom a larger person would not be able to get to the sink given the proximity to the shower screen on the bath super comfy bed and fantastic location the room on level   was above air conditioning units so sleep was not do great as we had to have the window open because it was very hot in the room we was moved to this room after we refused the other room on level   because the windows did not open not far from covent garden and the hotel looks amazing from the outside it was all good our family room which i booked was unavailable so the manager gave us two separate rooms and complimentary breakfast customer service was first class the staff were brilliant the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors staff were very friendly and helpful the bed was very comfy and everything very clean on arrival the doorman asked if i could get out my wheelchair and climb the stairs as the lift would take too long for him to set up big comfy room and the reception staff were excellent view of an inside courtyard room virtually furthest from entrance good exercise for the price and given the lead time booking i expected a view of london breakfast way below par for a hotel of this stature book in took all of   minutes as staff struggled to find us a room despite a   month lead time lovely bed well fitted out with ensuite we would return to the room after a day out on the city and housekeeping would not have cleaned our room yet at     in the afternoon and we d have to leave for   minute once housekeeping finally came by location is great my husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took   out of my account without permission   conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it they made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in london is a barrister and was appalled when we told him liked the room very cosy comfy bed my room was cancelled a few days before and i was given a room with a poor view but what made it worse was the fact the windows were dreadfully dirty and it was only the second floor made the room grubby also the step into the bath was extremely high i liked the jester of complimentary fruit and magazines in the room check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a   hotel in general i felt we paid more than we should have for what we got location for london centre was good bedroom needed redecorating poor storage facilities bath very small noise from workmen along corridor early morning deliveries below window bed comfortable safe hair drier and iron in room unfortunately i got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was very noisy room   by the way the first night it stopped at   p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so i hardly slept at all however when i mentioned this at checking out i was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time i come so i ended up feeling more pleased than i had thought i would be i have stayed at the russell several times before after my sleepless night i thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with i will certainly return the staff were all friendly professional and helpful and the location is great the hotel building is magnificent although the rooms are pretty standard uncomfortable bed small room windows requiring repair and were drafty and noisy and the room decor was extremely dated ideal location with friendly helpful staff the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult we moved to a different room on the  rd night of a   night stay so at least the last night was better but  st and  nd nights were disappointing location tired room with peeling wallpaper stained furniture cracks all over the room the duvet was lumpy however they fixed this right away the iron didn t work very well extremely cramped toilet as in the sink fitted just over the toilet seat had to be a contortionist to use it however it was clean hotel front very impressive facade lobby staircases doorman excellent staff and service throughout the stay shower clean and fresh towels and shampoo body wash lotion provided every day good mirrors well lit cupboard and safe with coffee making facilities tvs and wifi superb location   minute from russell square station bus stops a tesco express pret and the brunswick mall brimming with restaurants and convenient stores also   mins from the britush museum a very big plus we had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine the hotel was old but well looked after loved the entrance and stair case would have liked bigger room and one with a view but you don t go to london to sit in your room breakfast good but a little expensive beautiful grand hotel comfortable clean room polite and helpful staff excellent location in the heart of london great base for exploring didn t like being woken up an hour before needing to be woken up especially at    am good position for sight seeing good breakfasts great staffno negative the friendliness and courtesy of all the staff from the check in desk to the dining room staff i loved the comfortable bed the view over russell square gardens the high ceilings and ornate deco and the buffet breakfasts with everything anybody could possibly ask for even me as a vegetarian despite the grand public spaces the rooms are rather tired in terms of d cor and furnishings and really need to be torn apart and modernized the windows are grubby and haven t been cleaned in years after coming from a four star hotel in valencia that was exquisite in every respect i realized i had returned to shabby britain helpful and conscientious staff automatic     tip added to everything why do companies do this it gets right up my nose leaves you feeling either ripped off or nowty for asking for it to be removed such a shame would have been   out of   otherwise lovely hotel staff were fantastic very helpful food was wonderful too the saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual the air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside the bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person i really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep the staff were friendly and helpful particularly the reception and concierges the room was comfortable and had all we needed breakfast as always was very good and generous we like the atmosphere and ambience and it is so well placed for stations concerts etc room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet very friendly helpful staff the bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot the breakfast was lovely the building itself very impressive concierge people was so helpful no negative this is a grande olde dame of a hotel very charming right opposite russell square it is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome i stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet i quite liked that fact and i have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but i did not find fault and i stayed in a small double everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot tv had plenty channels housekeeping was very good i have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired a brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by maintainance unlike a previous hotel du vin that i stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything all the staff from the doormen conci rge to reception were very nice and helpful to me sometimes i think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet george the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay good olde grande dame lovely staff will benefit from her renovation within front desk receptionist was extremely rude programmed my key card incorrectly my room was in a far corner of the hotel   long corridors i dragged my suitcase and backpack there back and forth twice until they were able to get it right she didn t apologize mostly shrugged and said sometimes it s sensitive stands out as bad service generally good valueno negative the staff were absolutely amazing the location perfect great cafes in area for breakfast options etc beautiful room especially the bathroom highly recommended when i arrived at    pm the double room i had booked   was not available had been double booked and i was offered a single   with a so called free breakfast even though i knew the breakfast was normally   so they were actually ripping me off eventually they agreed   with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so i had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed the cooked breakfast was good quality though poor value for money   the building is old and there was a lot of noise from banging doors other residents i guess helpful friendly staff great location walking distance from the british museum and a short tube ride the the west end theatres was impossible to store extracted breastmilk in the freezer due to hotel policy i could use the fridge at reception but i would have booked a different hotel if i knew this beforehand aircon was quite noisy windows were dirty staff very friendly and helpful very well located easy travel to st pancras room rather gloomy due to limited light and external low level noise assume to be some kind of extraction units extra milk would have be helpful location excellent excellent customer service the rooms were to small and everything crammed in the overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work there was excessive noise from outside i e the kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about   which is ridiculous the air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it the tv remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the tv unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn tv off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise the outside of the building stunning property extract fan outside the window droned on and on all day and all night aggravating tinnitus location central period features nice bathroom with a bath friendly staff have stayed here several time in very nice rooms but this time the room was very tired with watermarks on the ceiling from a leak the shower leaked so much that there was no pressure i was moved to an equally tired room across the corridor but at least the shower worked i was obviously in the budget area but not at a budget price staff very helpful the first room a twin room facing the court yard was awful noisy air con and windows could not open unable to sleep but we got another room which was very nice we dont really eat breakfast and it was a little annoying that the reception lept trying to make us book breakfast the hotel is old but charming and the staff very accomodating lovely bar the location is great tube next door but one can easily walk to to many of the main attactions the room was a bit small and warm as only   window of the   could be opened for only   inches our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot bathroom was a bit disappointing small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down lovely grand hotel staff very helpful ideal location the concierge and door boy were very friendly ask for a taxi and the door boy waves one down for you outside the hotel very clean and love the old victorian style a hotel with a lot of history would book again no negative i appreciate warm professional staff willing to assist the customers great hotel very well placed near british museum nice ambiance comfortable rooms and clean room didn t face on to russell square but was quite noisy windows did little to cut out minimise noise fellow guests were also quite noisy walls doors were quite thin and noise filtered in cleanliness of the rooms was great despite not requested bath towels were replaced daily staff were very friendly and eager to please i e offering additional services size of room staff was very nice and helpful single rooms are small and seem to need some refurbishment the location was the main reason of my booking breakfast is good with good selection no negative the building exterior was very impressive the interior was stunning loved the history of the interior the bar was very comfortable and the restaurant for breakfast was excellent our room was quite small but had everything needed including a comfortable bed there wasn t anything to not like as we were celebrating our anniversary they had a large bottle of prosecco on ice along with a lovely chocolate moose left in our room on our arrival along with a card wonderful surprise hotel interior is looking a little tired and could do with a minor make over the rooms are very clean so don t be put off location is excellent and the hotel is quite grand prices were pretty reasonable for central london and the staff were excellent noise in room was awful toilet was stuck to the side of wash hand basin making it difficult to use very small bathroom windows need replacing urgently this will help with noise i was surprised at breakfast to find only mugs on the table no saucers no table covers tea and toast would be nice if brought to table herb sausages at breakfast scrambled eggs need to be kept hotter as with most of the buffet breakfast was lukewarm excellent location staff very friendly and helpful were able to answer all our questions disabled wet room was not informed about this during check in spacious room for central london beautiful building close to euston station and roti king the rooms are not so good the first night i stayed on the  th floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning the second night i moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small tha historical building which dates back to the turn of the century the common areas entrance hall the main staircase the bar and breakfast room are very grand and luxurious george the resident dragon on the second floor landing its twin is under the ocean on the titanic window needed to be washed but not much of a view on the backside of the building anyway convienent location on the picadilly line gives you direct access to heathrow coventry garden and leicester square just a few blocks from the british museum we had booked a superior room but were informed prior to arrival that due to renovations it would not be available provided us with a rebate for downgrading to a standard room and gave us free breakfast the room we got was much bigger than we expected which was a pleasant surprise the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay the breakfast was great although i don t know if i would spend the     per person if it was not included can not think of anything it is beautiful looking hotel fantastic staircase comfortable bar lounge the staff were all really pleasant and helpful from the minute we arrived at reception to collecting our bags when leaving shower was over the bath and it was high to get into a walk in shower is preferable for me however it didn t spoil our wonderful stay beautiful decor great position nothing no complaints throughout our stay the hotel and staff was excellent we have been before and will be back in the near future really enjoy our stay there the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair the location is good very near the station and some good restaurants hotel s architecture both inside and outside is amazing i had a double room at the back of the hotel which was a bit noisey due to air conditioner units the room should of had a fridge and being a double room should of had two of everything in the bathroom which it did not staff and facilities were good as were comfort levels room wasn t available until     hours after check in time bathroom too small we expected a little more from a four star hotel beautiful entrance and grand looking building comfortable bed i can t think of anything my daughter and i came down to visit soas and were looking forward to staying in style we loved the space in the room the armchairs that the windows opened onto the park having an actual bath in the bathroom having real glasses rather than plastic cups the beds were comfortable and cosy we could leave our suitcases with concierge and generally we loved everything about the russell hotel refreshments in the bedroom were very poor for a hotel of this calibre wallpaper loose on ceiling all rooms should be in excellent condition the ambience of the hotel was very good very good staff position very good shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying i know its central london and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good comfortable room and a decent size for a single room location excellent very clean and had nice desk chair tea and coffee stuff small double bed was great also liked the general ambience and the style of the hotel is lovely could have done with a hook next to the shower to hang your towel on the building was spectacular inside and out the staff were very friendly and efficient the room was to a high standard and the food was out of this world the room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse we change the room more than one time enduring the rest of our staying it s really an old hotel the lobby is astonishment attracting heater work well and enough despite being on the  th floor we couldn t believe how noisy our room was from the traffic in the street below single glazed very old windows that really need replaced though a good wash would be a start bed was not comfy the room was small but clean i think these rooms are for booking com customers you get what you pay for i guess lovely looking old building nice entrance area friendly staff good breakfast  th floor bedroom with fabulous view close to the tube station room was small but no complaints given the price that s london unless you pay top dollar receptionist really pleasant and helpful i worked most of the day in my rom and it was perfect for that the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still the staff was very nice and hotel looks great from outside but not so much inside rooms the room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel it felt far cheaper than the   i paid but the bathroom was excellent the service location and general appearance can t think of anything really i found the staff super friendly and helpful front desk restaurant door men room staff dining room and kitchen staff they all took the trouble to talk and help that s impressive i love the history of the building it has retained its wonderful victorian heritage don t change that i loved the dragon on the  nd floor staircase so cool the wifi in my room and all around the hotel worked well it was located very close to the tube station no issues we have stayed several times over the years live the building its location and find the staff very helpful breakfast good range and excellent value eaten at leisure the bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of staff were all extremely friendly the location was good hotel was clean presentable at all times the breakfast was lovely hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired staff were very helpful and kind as it was my daughters birthday weekend so went the extra mile with rose petals on the bed and cake would have been nice to have a view of russel square from the room but luck of the draw i guess the hotel is beautiful inside and out staff were very friendly and approachable nothing not to like we liked the friendly welcome we got when we arrived at the hotel the staff were very helpful we booked a superior double room but were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite a wonderful surprise the hotel was absolutely beautiful having no lift found the  rd floor very hard to climb the stairs as i m restricted because of health problem definitely would go back to this hotel only on a ground floor rooms very large clean we had lovely views overlooking the park the breakfast was always the same the room and bathroom very small the fruit juices were not fresh the staff that opened the doors was always grumpy excellent location very clean the bed that was not so confortabl my room was looking in the inner part of the building and was really noisy outside the position close to the tube and all the places i had to visit for my business trip not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell no double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight ridiculous price for breakfast originally   which i declined upgraded from single double room had room overlooking courtyard which had massive air conditioning units they were really noisy needed earplugs tea and milk was not replenished staff friendly and helpful location excellent beautiful looking hotel and breakfast good this isn t a dislike but our bathroom was looking abit tired and needed a face lift but having so many rooms i am sure the upgrade will get there we were on tge  th floor the whole atmosphere of the wonderful hotel we had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room the concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue they fixed one the second night but not the other the staff is excellent they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and comfortable highly recommend them for that they deliver a genuine feeling of old school london marvelous the location is perfect for bus underground and walking my externally booked stonehenge tour also met up at this hotel making it extremely convenient had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid i feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel we also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which i don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them the actual room we eventually got was amazing even though we had to pay an upgrade because it wasn t in the price bracket of the one we had initially booked the receptionist was very helpful but i don t know what would have happened if we had not paid the additional upgrade to get a better room i have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time   was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits there wasn t even any bottled water also on trying to find the room at    pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction we then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage the hotel location is excellent and the building is stunning inside and out the staff were accommodating and very pleasant as always the breakfast special offer was also a good bonus plus the fact we could leave our luggage with the concierge as our room wasn t ready and we didn t return until     was a real comfort it was lovely to be able to sit in the bar with a glass of wine and unwind after a very hectic day the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off we had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it the waitress explained it was from the ice we had specifically ordered without ice it took two of us complaining twice to get it changed v poor considering     per glass breakfast v average more like a   star hotel a very impressive hotel when first entering cold room no fridge or mini bar tv was useless and would barely work room was a bit tired staff extremely friendly fab location very convenient location to shops bars and restaurants extremely comfy bed in junior suite and spacious room sound insulation our room gave on the street and it was really noisy small bed a bit expensive staff s kindness and efficiency the cake for my girlfriend s birthday really nice attention cleanliness location i wanted to do a checkout the night before i left due to an early train and i was surprised it wasn t possible the next morning checkout took a little longer than planned and we missed a train to the airport getting us there later than planned but the great thing was reception had kindly printed our boarding cards for us which made up the time the beds were great the concierge was perfect the breakfast copious our stay was worth every pound nicely located quiet inside our room and wonderful in every way i have been staying at the russell several times a year for twenty years though less frequently now i feel that breakfast arrangements are less customer friendly than they used to be paper napkins have replaced fabric there are no saucers for the coffee cups and i had to go hunting for a desert spoon and a teaspoon overall very pleasant my room on the  th floor had been refurbished but some of the fittings were of poor quality and should have been rejected i have stayed at the russell before and am pleased to see the refurbishment work continues the staff were all attentive and sought to ensure i was having a pleasant stay room small overlooking air con units and the windows were screwed shut had to rely on air con not a comfortable night nice location and really nice building breakfast was tasty and good value at   but not if we had had to pay full price of   bed and room were comfortable if a little cramped getting to the wardrobe was difficult with the table and chair in the way linen good quality but again the bathroom was neat beds although twins had to be touching to leave room at either side glad windows opened but they could have done with cleaning or repainting thermos flasks of tea at b f was brilliant idea location of hotel made up for any negatives no negative this is a grand old hotel currently being refurbished but still very comfortable it is a great location especially if you are catching early morning trains or coming into london late in the day very close to the british museum its a very old hotel undergoing rehab which made for some noise and dust however the worse part of the hotel was the internet we needed to work and were unable to connect to anything workable its a cool old hotel but if you re going on business and need internet bring your own the location is excellent the exterior of the hotel has beautiful architecture reception were exceptionally slow at booking in checking out the rooms were very tatty paint flaikinh off the wall the sink was cracked etc lack of vegetarian food available location very good very grand building from the outside which is let down internally opaque window so had no view well positioned clean comfortable and well appointed room staff friendly and very helpful we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again long waiting time at check in which was not yet peak time noisy difficult getting to sleep and woken up early for the same reason location and general quality we had no cold running water with   days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next   mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable location of the hotel was very central for all the things we wanted to see central for tube the windows in the bedroom had broken sashes and paint flacking off and odd bodged tiles around the toilet excellent location with friendly and helpful staff the consierge was very helpful when i asked for a route on the tube windows are made with frosted glass so there is no way to see the view or even to open them no mini fridge in the room there is no information on how to call the reception from the room the sink in the bathroom was blocked and hook for the towels was just laying in the hole detached from the wall photos attached moreover there was very strange sound coming from the street which was annoying and disturbed our sleep water costs   ponds per bottle do not feel like   stars at all location the confusion at check in as i d altered the booking from double and a single room refunderble to a twin and single none refunderble they said that i still had the refunderble booked and needed to pay as to late to cancel luckerly i had proof on my phone but they still insisted i contact booking com to check the door staff where very friendly and helpfull we had a broken cold tap in the bathroom which couldn t be repaired that day we booked an alarm call for    am which came late there was no trouser press in the room we had paid extra for an upgrade we the room was large the beds were very comfortable the lifts appeared quickly when summoned we liked the ambience and the beautiful staircase pillows were lumpy shower drained very slowly so you have to keep stopping it for it to drain breakfast way overpriced at     asked for a nice view but had a horrid one so kept curtains closed comfy beds beautiful victorian building good location next to a tube station half way between madame tussaud s and the west end theatres well placed for covent garden leicester square piccadilly circus good local coffee sandwich shops incl pret a manger cafe nero would appreciate a   level charge for breakfast i only eat a bowl a cereal matress too soft bedroom comfortably warm but dining room is very cold small beds premier inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front also cost of a glass of wine at   for a relatively basic malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere we got a great deal through booking com called the shopping package fabulous value for two nights a good breakfast friendly staff and beautiful building the breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price we were with a party of   there wasn t any negotiation on the price nice warm clean room very friendly kind helpful staff it was a bit noisy with busy road just outside nice room well maintained yet still with character eco friendly products in the bathroom friendly staff the room was much smaller than the one we had last time excellent location superb historic building very nice and helpful staff one of my favourite hotels in london despite it being midwinter the temperature of the rooms was very high and the air conditioning made no difference even the alternative room we were offered was just as hot neat rooms during my last   days the wifi connection became very weak and spotty staff said it was being worked on but i sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history hotel russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should the staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable i also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room i look forward to coming back throughout the years to come the windows in our room were unfortunately in need of repair with one rather loose glass pane rattling every so often from the traffic on the streets below traffic is heavy from  am so this meant no lie in for me double glazing may help excellent reception by the manager upon our arrival upgraded our room following a room mix up and offered complimentary dinner by means of apology the concierge was also very helpful and the location of the hotel was fantastic for access to public transport on our last day the hotel kept our bags secure while we enjoyed the remainder of our time in london will most certainly be staying again the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries location excellent and the opulent decor really stands out staff were all very friendly and responded very quickly to any requests we made light fittings and bathroom door were dirty cooked breakfast was very greasy and not enough electric sockets available excellent customer service staff fantastic location good coffee bathroom a bit old and it wasn t cleaned properly room itself was excellent location near the underground station is super convenient had a quick meal at the bar and really liked the food beds were good too twin superior room room was clean but in need of some repairs eg broken tiles on bathroom floor and bottom drawers badly worn room was ready early staff friendly and helpful lovely breakfast despite being in the heart of london but the location is very noisy and inconvenient a lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave i would never stay there again next to the underground station good wifi friendly receptionists location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view i had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated classic architecture preserved nicely tv is at a height and an angle where you cant watch it when sitting in a chair you either have to sit far away or stand up not to get a distorted view breakfast not being included in the room rate is a big minus for me the quality of the breakfast was excellent the mattress bed sheets comforter and pillow not comfy enough aicon a bit noisy overall staff are commendable helpful and attentive location is good and very convenient facade of hotel looks impressive the noise level in my room from the ventilation put it this way i woke up   times bed was comfy the breakfast was really nice and the bathroom was good not a dislike but some areas could do with a spring clean its a busy hotel so difficult to close areas off to follow this through however this would not stop me from staying here again i have stayed at this hotel a few times now and can never find any major faults with it it has great connections on the tube however is in walking distance to your main shopping areas and sight seeing staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is as you expect it to be the room was spacious and very comfy bed i will stay here again the noise it was extremely noisy in the morning from  am with the sound of sirens going to the nearby hospitals every   minutes in fact the standard twin was small and bathroom tiny the location was good in that we could walk to a number of places ran out of hot food items eg bacon sausages left waiting for breakfast on both days windows don t open in the rooms for security reasons so no fresh air in the room hotel bar prices are quite expensive great location handy for tube we felt safe good breakfast nice room comfortable bed air conditioning horrendously noisy cutting in with a loud bang every   mins throughout the night very poor sleep as a result really central location the public areas were very grand but our room was a little worn the windows were filthy there were lights missing and the bathroom floor was not entirely clean scrambled egg was brilliant the highlight of a very well supplied breakfast buffet fantastic location very helpful and friendly staff good value for money for the location the window in room   was very old and was a draft coming in from the gaps bed was comfy had a nice view in the room and bathroom was nicely set out we were in a family room frosted windows looking at brick wall no natural light and room was very old and cold not enough towels or toiletries for us all staff and location were excellent breakfast was great also no bath in the room inside courtyard facing window horrible view windows wouldn t stay open shower door wouldn t close very small television and phone located in bathroom the style of hotel excellent staff and great location price ok for a business trip though slightly high considering breakfast wasn t included in room price upgraded room could have been nicer great location in front of russel square park beautiful old building and great service from staff no negative the bed was comfortable there was enough light in the room to work often hotel lighting is not suitable the room was well equipped and a good size for london some of the staff are not very helpful not professional the facilities are bad e g small left not suitable for people with wheelchair or having many large luggage my room was very small with tiny sink in which the water not moving easily rapidly get full the do not disturb sign was missing location price nothing not to like at a  pn price point well maintained victorian splendour great bar and breakfast room wide carpeted corridors large room with requested walk in shower the only reason i booked with hotel russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up i like the decor the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby we got upgraded to the junior suite heating had broken in there however they had already put two heaters in so we didn t need to ask the reception bar staff and porter were very friendly and accommodating no negative the location is great a lot of nice restaurants and caf s around the corner the subway underground is less than a minute away and that takes you directly to heathrow airport covent garden picadilly circus and knightsbridge british museum is just   minutes away on foot no negative this is a wonderful old hotel in a great location easy access to underground but also with walking distant to most attractions serge and bernard made our stay at the russell very special from the moment we arrived to our departure   days later they went out of their way to make our stay at the russell memorable we had   rooms booked and one wasnt ready at check in time we had to wait an hour for it the bathrrom in one of the rooms was tiny location was excellent rooms were nice and the bed was lovely staff were all friendly and helpful absolutely nothing the hotel is just amazing and such a pleasure to stay there in central london from when you walk through the doors you feel special and the reception staff are fantastic loved my stay here and will be bringing my family back for a special visit lifts are little small so at busy times and with suitcases became a challenge more drawer space would ve been helpful and compliment refreshments tray would ve benefitted from bottled water room overlooked all the boiler pipes etc which at times was very loud nice breakfast but over priced for what it was very convenient location friendly staff always happy and eager to assist beautifull hotel sumptuously decorated i had a junior double room which had a large bathroom with bath and shower great for relaxing at the end of a busy day we stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from   the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy however would still stay again the location is good hotel is very nice staff lovely and friendly breakfast good spacious room the room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner i expected it and it wasn t much of an issue the staff member who checked us in was fantastic his name was miles and he was so lovely helped us enormously and scored us some cake for the room a winner in my book even free glasses of wine as our room was not ready at the stated time rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including   stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room location of the hotel is very good very close to public transportation no notice given fire alarm tested no staff on floors to say there was not a fire rooms not cleaned until very late in the day breakfast good staff in dining room good the bathroom is very small i had a very comfortable small room overlooking the square the bar has a good atmosphere to relax in after an exhausting day and to enjoy a light meal the underground is nearby which makes it easy to get around in london the frosted windows limited light to some extent but then again views in london can be rather poor this is a very high grade hotel with splendid rooms friendly staff and a good splash of luxury i was initially given a room which had no wifi and without heating room was freezing cold i was offered to t have a electric heater to warm up the room the room was changed but the one which was changed was much smaller and was noisy the wash basin had non functional tap luckily i had one night stay booked only won t like to stay in this hotel ever again not recommended close location to tube station maid didn t make the room two days it is a begging xx century building with very comfortable and warm rooms the building was conceived by the same architect of the titanic elegant restaurant very very poor sleep during stay not much a very very loud heating system which banged as though some one was hitting the door every   minutes throughout the night requested a room change for the next one to be even lower like a turbo engine starting directly over the top of the bed also given the wrong room number on arrival odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms don t people have the internet the dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being   people behind the bar chatting to each other all in all a great hotel but not well run amazing exterior we felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel i e toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths the room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar this was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe staff were very helpful and nice to deal with windows need cleaning shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing the only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up overall great price for central london some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really not impeccably clean but not what i d call dirty either windows could use a cleaning room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central london staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until  a is great considering every other pub closes at  p or midnight plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the picadilly line is one block away i stayed here   nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price i paid no negative beautiful building external and internal which makes you feel like you are staying somewhere special very handy for the theatre which was the reason for our trip the air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also the hotel was beautiful in setting just what we were looking for the hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working     you can not imagine the noise check the photos no refrigerator room was rather small close to the center living in a hotel of your dreams like a fairy tail the personnel was extremely polite and helpful this property is listed as accessible my daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods this facility is only accessible if they set up a motorized device much like a stairway system installed in one s home can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went the embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated i ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the     steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing this facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times in fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair the staff requires education later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system please change your listing to not accessible the table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over the bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed the concierge max and doorman serge were extremely helpful in our navigating the city the location is very central facing russell square very close to the british museum and     walk to piccadilly circus russell square is very nicely landscaped tiny room for   while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking beware good location in central london close to several tube stops lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek atmosphere staff overall facilities location the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas we were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room this turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room the location was great and the sense of place and old world was good however i generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because carluccio s is close at hand and i am more interested in italian cuisine than a more conservative english hotel cuisine i hesitate to say that i am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects nevertheless these might be the only parts of the russell that would benefit from change that being said however few hotels manage change successfully and i would hate to see the russell lose its undoubted charm the russell is one of my favourite hotels in london perhaps my favourite the architecture and the decoration of the ground floor in particular is interesting as well as charming the view over russell square is lovely the staff especially the concierges are very helpful and the proximity of the hotel to the british library extremely convenient the bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip the pillows were well used and lumpy the breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were luke warm and queuing up to make toast the offer i booked was good value the wine and chocolates were a nice element the hotel was in a good position and the hotel was clean and well laid out the staff were all friendly and helpful a good selection at breakfast but some elements were poor quality found the room far to hot comparable to when i slept in egypt but that s probably personal to me would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping location was great for tube and walking into the heart of action bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in london if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it but overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly returnno positive the room we had was v small for the amount we paid   for one night you could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes good location and beautiful building and the bed was comfy easy walk to theatres shops and sites no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly small tv screen the atmosphere and the architecture of the building comfortable room nice bathroom with a great shower no negative the staff particularly the porters were very friendly and more than happy to talk to you and make you feel welcome serge provided us with a detailed history of the building and local area our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful no positive staff not as professional as i remember layout of the reception entrance hall does not reflect the grandeur of the hotel proximity to st pancras kings cross tube stations comfortable rooms and good hotel i had to wait over   minutes for a bar meal the bed was extremely comfortable and my single room was spacious in comparison to some of the single rooms i ve had in other hotels handy for euston and st pancreas stationsno negative the staff were extremely friendly and attentive the interior it historic and stunning the bar is cosy and yet sophisticated a good place to drink and relax in even if traveling on your own no double glazing on our windows so traffic noise awful from  am no conditioner in the bathroom no shower caps breakfast food was pretty ordinary seems like it s now aiming at the imperial hotels market which is frankly down market used to do better i love this building and many of the bedrooms have plenty of space and character room was tired looking very small and windows had so much condensation damp i had to use a towel to dry it off not good for my asthma the staff were really all very helpful professional and lovely location was superb for us i didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost i ve stayed at other   star hotels with much more variety the bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card i had to make several attempts i liked the fact that the hotel was a lovely old building with a grand reception area and decor the staff were friendly and the rooms spacious and clean the hotel was within walking distance from the british museum covent garden soho i also liked the fact that it is practically next to russell square underground station and holborn statio is very close we have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room   so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before will maybe avoid this room next time no positive the lifts are very small breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers i would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages the location is excellent the stuff is friendly and overall the service was very good the room is clean and comfortable the first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well good location staff were friendly would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future beautiful hotel fantastic staff kind helpful friendly knowledgable great breakfast selection beautiful common areas perfect location for our needs the room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double no bath no view in fact no window i can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard i am very dissapoibted with both the hotel and your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel not a lot breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night loved the location very grand old style hotel everything was perfect lovely room and bathroom staff very friendly bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable room a little dated and check in was slow due to roads being closed around bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to   mins later we found it was only a short walk so could be better on other days great location friendly tempus bar beautiful building and opposite park and the history such as george the dragon good quality breakfast as always with ph just missing touches such as tea pots tea cups and fruit coulis etc the bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways if the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable good location no negative quiet room although so central possibility of a single room water hot and plentiful bed comfortable hotel clean breakfast lovely newspapers provided no negative opulent surroundings and friendly helpful staff the tempus bar brings added luxury with its leather wood paneling and wide selection of drinks great location for soho and covent garden we loved every minute of our stay we will definitely return i have never seen a worse bed in any hotel i ve stayed in anywhere in the world was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment staff dealt with my complaint very well tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night not warm enough handy location nice hotel however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel tv handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment the architecture the lobby breakfast room and bar very class and brittish old style the buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet i ve ever had plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel room was small but comfortable clean and good value for money reception staff were good other staff seemed fairly disengaged hotel is historic and architecturally interesting decor is extremely tired and dated wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom dust around edges of carpet i m not sure how this is acceptable in a central london hotel which costs upwards of   per night definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although i can t praise the staff enough concierge and reception staff were outstanding friendly helpful the best customer service i have come across truly the saving grace of this hotel called reception from our room and one of the staff arrived at our door within   minutes and was very polite and cheerful particular thanks to carey on concierge who was exceptionally helpful there was nothing that we didn t like the hotel was beautiful it was very clean it was ideal in location the staff very friendly very helpful had a bad experience with room service   minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another   minutes clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call we also paid for late check out until  pm but were disturbed   times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication great location spacious room room was ready early so we could check in at     bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off there could be possibility to go to the balcony the hotel has very beautiful interiors nice helpful and talkative staff extremely comfortable beds personal not amiable the room did not match the pictures on the website the ac in my room was really noisy and it took me   visits to the reception for them to change my room great location for shopping and close to st pancras station bring earplugs lots of traffic noise but no problem with earplugs in very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff comfortable rooms and beds very nice breakfast and good food in general i will certainly use it again when in london despite the traffic noise excellent value when booked through this website bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures friendly staff great location good sized room with a comfortable bed the breakfast experience is like something out of bhs they need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service i won t go in again location and price nothing outstanding customer service comfort in the rooms and the public areas of the hotel and just that feeling of being made to feel welcome every day my room wasn t very clean dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk when i mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me white spots on extra blanket so i didn t want to use it although i love the location and this is my  nd stay it will probably be my last love location hysterical value of building breakfast was good but i don t understand why a   charge for a tray when your already being charged room service fees no negative we stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered awesome location we liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible i think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before it sure wasn t the room stunk had a bank of about   aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool the bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good they also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu no negative the hotel was beautiful very elegant all the staff were very friendly and helpful especially bernard the concierge the location was great with much to see and do within walking distance we would definitely stay there again there was a large cobweb in the corner above the tv room   the bar area was difficult to find a seat so i had to resort to staying in my room when i just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer the staff really looked after the customers in a very polite and professional manner had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested freezing room until radiators kicked in tired carpet poor insulated windows central location beautiful victorian features very comfortable bed very serene view auto service charge paying extra for breakfast good food but no better than other uk     star i ve stayed in no soundproofing comfy room with reasonable extras needed a shower cap tho as shower didn t lower control was on bath tap the bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere very reasonable rate spotlessly clean standard room very good breakfast with smiling helpful and polite staff nice bar area we booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly they moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was   single beds pushed together they gave us the   it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there they then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine for the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again the location my room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience really really friendly efficient staff i went for the single room option and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was was clean and with a spacious bathroom very comfortable stay a i m glad i booked it convent garden is only a   min walk away and russell square tube station is just outside the hotel so very convenient not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room location and style and history of the building breakfast pricing of   for   ppl was not included in our stay deal seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps london thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at giraffe cafe   minutes away very nice the bed was amazingly comfy and huge the hotel was clean and a work of art amazing and beautiful building staff extremely friendly and courteous very well informed and helpful loved all the retro art deco features rooms tastefully done would definitely stay again great location we got a room that was very small and not very fresh the pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got we could change room though very helpful and nice staff tube directley from heathrow to the hotel we had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight i was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users i also found i kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests the shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height i required and needed constant raising we went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two so why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier location of hotel for our trip was good the hotel is impressive and the staff were friendly the beds were comfortable and clean staff at the reception didn t give us   sets of cards the lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room location was great and the room was very spacious no leisure gym facilities easy access to the west end on foot friendly professional staff the building is beautiful with art deco features rooms of a good size the decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped this was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel the style of the hotel was quite grand and the christmas decorations were lovely and festive the location was perfect for my needs and there are lots of shops and cafes very nearby for e g breakfast or lunch with pubs and restaurants close too or very short walk away for even more choice i was in a single room that was well suited size wise the layout of the room is well considered and the most is made of the space some noise at times if staying on the front of the hotel from road noise but the windows and curtains muffle that overnight superb looking place extremely comfortable and welcoming only a few things the blind in the bathroom covered with dirty fingerprints and the one in the bedroom coming away from windowframe also couldn t get the shower to work but that may just have been me staff very friendly helpful and welcoming from the moment you enter upgraded free to a double room instead of a single fantastic central location moments away from tube station and an easy walk to central london locations lovely clean spacious comfortable room and fantastic room service our bedroom was very small that together with our very small bathroom and the continual annoyance that the water in the bath was very very very slow exit added to our chagrin i did mention to reception staff the problem we encountered with our bath however nothing transpired to resolve this matter the monies offer for our stay was tempting enough to get us thereno negative i was booked in the wrong twin room at first i was moved to a lovely comfort room but the telephone did not work and had to go to reception to request engineer to fix phone had to be moved again as phone could not be fixed bar staff did not know that a egg benedict had bacon in it no wake up alarm despite the fact that they asked if i wanted it price was good egg florentine was nice breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive i like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait on the whole all the staff were very helpful and professional and friendly especially max on the concierge desk making sure we had a car booked to take us to the ritz for dinner and the very polite helpful doorman nothing beautiful hotel staff were very friendly and helpful brilliant location  minties walk to a tube station and right opposite russell square gardens would definitely stay again unwanted alarm call at   am rather spoiled my day but got our breakfasts free to compensate so pleased with that breakfast room needs refurbishment to make more of the titanic connection superb location great ambience loved the tempus bar sensitive restoration of historic features and information about them was much appreciated no negative staff were extremely polite and happy to help in any capacity although it was a single room it did not feel cramped or as though i was less important than anyone else lovely bathroom pillows hard shower tray didnt drain had to time shower outside patio door didnt fit draughts to room location across the road for bristish museum     mins walk leicester squareno negative it was my daughters birthday there was cake gifts a card awaiting us in our room situated opposite a lovely park staff very nice smiley well worth a visit christmas tree was lovely no negative me and my girlfriend booked this hotel in the treat your partner package we stayed one night but enjoyed ourselves the facilities were lovely unfortunately we missed the free breakfast as we sampled the night life in london the late check out was a lovely touch will definitely come back next yearno negative the rooms were booked for my   birthday so i could celebrate with friends it was perfect and please pass on a thank you to the staff on duty the whole atmosphere friendliness of the staff fantastic the room which we were in was a standard one needs a revamp there was black mild on bathroom tiles if any older persons were stopping in that room it s very difficult to get into the bath the entrance the food choice in the restaurant is not very pronounced and exciting more fresh fruit at breakfast room excellent staff friendly and efficient breakfast very goodno negative could not fault the staff or the hotel from start to finish staff couldn t have been more helpful or friendly the room was amazing very spacious spotless and so comfortable the hotel is in a great location literally round the corner from russell square station i would definitely stay here again and have been recommending it to everyone during our stay there was a problem with the toilet not clearing however this was fixed fairly quickly and another room given to use that toilet whilst we were inconvenienced so a minus and a plus here we had a meal arranged for christmas lunch and my wife who is partially disabled had to flag down a taxi for herself directly outside the hotel even though there was concierge staff on duty nearby i was angry at the lack of helpfulness the location is unbeatable the staff are friendly and very helpful max of the concierge staff was very helpful friendly and enthusiastic room was small and very basic for price but bed very comfortable view was onto a wall would be nice to have a mini bar fridge and water plus additional wall sockets we had to unplug tv to charge phone i pad location was perfect for our theatre visit and sightseeing very close to bus and underground staff were very helpful especially at breakfast in the bar when restaurant was crowded the beds vere hard and unplesant the rooms old and need a renovation the staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was and they did not give u time to look at the bar meny they wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar not good at all the hotel was to expensive all in all no positive that s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch tv or read the bed moved forward away from wall the bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink there was a smell coming from the sink when you used it i think its needs some bleach we did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of     each for   nights would be nearly     we ate out instead the staff were excellent all round and very happy to help you with anything always said hello the doormen were particularly good and the overall level of service and friendliness was the best i have had loved to be able to open the windows fully as it was very warm and opening the windows enabled a pleasant comfortable sleep excellent position from tube station i deal   hours shop across the road lots of places to eat breakfast around the hotel nothing staff were not helpful and infact rude it was not what we were expecting it looked dated and nothing like the pictures we then decides to stay at the may fair hotel instead and got a refund won t be going there again that s for sure nothing expensive breakfast went to pret some fittings not right bathroom door did not shut plug in sink didn t forgivable because its such an iconic building but certainly not competition to the best in the west end great building marble staircase comfy bar the bar was closed when we returned at   o clock on new years eve they wouldnt even bring us a drink to the room entrance to the hotel is very nice wish we arrived earlier so we vould have eaten old hotel with small rooms for   stars construction work right outside my window could not sleep did not effect price rather stay in a modern hotel with upgraded facilities great location room was smaller than cheaper hotel next door less facilities i e tea coffee selection music from wedding booming until     pm though they did pay for two breakfasts to compensate nice reception area the tv didn t work in the standard rooms it s very dated very basic and not what i d expect from a  star hotel premier inn would have been better shower had mould sort of inside the sealant really noisey this place needs the double glazing looking at the junior suite was really nice little things like the windows not shutting properly let it down the location was great the quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad for the money i paid i expected at least a decent mattress good location conveniently located next to the tube nice looking building far from the attractions and russell square tube is pointless everything was perfect room fizz chocolates and petals plus birthday cake upon arrival kept our luggage for many hours safe the hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately   feet away from the dressing table this is too far away when trying to style your hair fortunately i had taken my own hair dryer the lighting in the room was too low it would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier it was close to the office where i work missed breakfast one day as insufficient capacity in the restaurant and the wait would have been too long as i had to go to a meeting location and priceno negative location of hotel is excellent big spacious room great value for money lovely christmas feeling decorations only tiny negative i booked a room for   people and the room only had toiletries tea coffee cups for   people wifi didnt work in the room staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door cant control water temperature no free water daily restaurant food disappointing all in all we cant recommend this hotel just only location is  mins walk to big shopping steeet and easy access to tube trainee receptionist at front desk was rude and abrupt very poor and mean selection of tea coffee etc in hotel room and the same for shampoo moisturising etc samples in bathroom an extremely beautiful hotel in a brilliant location comfortable beds i ordered a sandwich from the limited room service available after  pm but was very disappointed that the beef slices had an inch of thick fat on each this was extremely poor quality the location was great for catching the tube and only one stop from king s cross the staff were extremely friendly and helpful plus there was an excellent breakfast the dining room was too full and very noisy we did not like having to queue for a table the tap in the bathroom leaked the staff were friendly and efficient i feel that the bathroom showers baths could be improved and made more user friendly having to clamber into the bath to have your shower should be a thing of the past the helpful staff nothing was too much trouble the staff could have been a little more helpful with our luggage they didn t seem to realise that helping us from the door to the lifts would have been a huge help however the staff were very friendly which made up for that the staff were extremely helpful and engaging the bedroom was extremely well equipped iron hair drier kettle which made it extremely easy for us to prepare for our evenings out on the town and well as enjoy tea coffee and cakes during our stay oh and the view was amazing we had a corner view looking over the park no negative the hotel was esquisite and staff was extremely pleasant and helpful we very much enjoyed the substantial buffet breakfast it is less than a block from the russell square tube station although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice our room was really nice the first night large room with a window we decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool there was a bank of about   air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy the bathroom stunk of mold and lynx deodorant the drains were blocked and the bed was terrible it was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all i think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing an upgrade was offered to us the second night for   pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night but we definitely didnt on a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place the building is beautiful and well maintained great location easy to get around and great value compared to other hotels in the area very grand and gothic love the links with the titanic too the main light in the bedroom didn t work and although maintenance came quickly it was never replaced meaning the room was quite dark we also thought we would have a safety deposit box in our room which turned out not to be there welcomed by very friendly staff comfortable bed and clean room the bar was especially good and the bar staff were very nice a convenient location the exterior of the building is magnificent but the interior has seen better days and in need of a refurb at the end of the day the rooms are compact clean and comfortable just don t plan on spending too much time in them which you shouldn t be get outside and see some stuff or go hang in a pub location was convenient for us about half way between the eurostar station and covent garden so an easy walk or tube ride to everything couple of decent pubs within a stones throw as well shower only problem was the small bath and the shower head was far to low my husband is   foot plus as are many men he has back problems and found ot extremely difficult bending down yo take a shower breakfast on sunday morning was a disaster arriving half an hour before service was due to close we found a queue to get a table with many many tables waiting to be cleared there was no hot food left and a real shortage of staff hot food did not finally all come through until an hour after we arrived at the restaurant staff were great throughout great location and close to tube station lovely building some staff not helpful few problems with the room leaky shower door bed on castors with brakes that didn t work a rattling window and a loose connection on tv we loved the architecture and look of the hotel some staff were wonderful location was amazing the positives seem to end with the building the staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order the room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time the breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on the hotel is beautiful the exterior and the interior are stunning the location is also very convenient to the piccadilly line tube station and short walk to euston kings cross and tottenham court road the breakfast buffet had a lot of options disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which i suspect were from a different hotel altogether this was misleading the suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door i felt this was poor value for the additional money spent very convenient location room key was older strip type which failed to work even the replacement was temperamental which was a bit of an inconvenience with me being located on the  th floor staff size of room and cleanliness of it grand old hotel very poor water pressure in sink and had to run tap for several minutes before vaguely warm toulet did not flush properly very difficult to climb into bath and shower was one of those you have to stand in the water flow to adjust risking scalding or freezing shower was freezing in morning with no hot water for   mins had to give up furnishings a little tired staff were welcoming and professional room on  rth floor very quiet and bed very comfortable no negative situation of hotel staff were very friendly and informative we up graded to a deluxe room slightly disappointed as the room was small would have liked to have seen a standard room one staff member on check in was obviously having a bad day the other staff however were very helpful the room was great and the location was terrific easy to get to on the underground from heathrow room was very warm character of the hotel plush with all the mod cons you d expect good location for st pancras station covent garden strand etc always seems a bit pricey in london as we are hardly in the room we would book here again staff unpleasant walking past lots of smokers every time you returned to the hotel view of sky dishes toiletries water etc not replenished furniture in room marked dirty within walking distance to theatres the heating in the restaurant was not working with the air conditioning locked in the on position not possible to enjoy eating there in the evening original room allocated was not as requested small and with one small double bed not able to move room until the next day and then only at an additional charge very small bar area with nowhere else to sit with friends the location was fine no negative the welcome and service provided by the concierge staff was excellent we particularly appreciated the attention and courtesy of carey and bernard who remembered us from previous visits and went out of their way to help us and make us feel at home we travel a lot and in our experience those two are in a special class we would come back for them alone upgrade at   per night which had been previously at   online view across park from   obscured by grime on external window but not a big issue though was area son for taking upgrade the bath after a long day shopping no adverse experiences whatsoever the room was extremely well designed for its space and managed to include a nice desk with comfortable chair and an additional comfortable chair the heating worked efficiently the bathroom was nice the maid service was excellent the wifi worked very well in my room also the reception and concierge service were excellent booked and paid for this booking for a colleague she doubled checked all was paid on check in was told all okay then was made to pay a supplement on checkout have since emailed looking for the gms name so i could get their feedback on my colleagues experience to date haven t heard back from them as a company we will not use hotel again no positive the two night stay was a little pricey for a relatively small room and with no breakfast included although the room was clean quiet and comfortable the general ambience of the hotel is very impressive the staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful there was a wedding on which made it a little noisy when sleeping despite asking for a room at the back so it was quiet the location of the hotel is excellent room   dirty filthy windows with some double glazed panels missing from the frames cracked floor tiles in bathroom dirty basin old creased badly fitted carpet and dirty greasy finger marks above the bed bulbs out tv not working not what i would expect for   star quick response to change my room when i had been given a dirty grotty tired run down room which i had upgraded to deluxe single room was rather noisy due to hvac system duct outside and poor quality single pane windows offering little insulation non smoking room requested but hall had a hint of tobacco awesome old building the continual noise from the air conditioning heating fans outside and the loud beats of music from a party evening both making it difficult to get to sleep the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent pillows were too soft without an option in the room lifts were a bit of a problem on our final day excellent location   minutes from the tube and a nice walk from the city centreno negative i always get a warm welcome when i arrive the staff are very attentive and knowledgable it has a good atmosphere and i i was travelling alone it would be my first choice could not find our booking on arrival eventually found not listed under my surname chaos leaving luggage as early check in was not actioned lots of fire doors to get through with luggage to room key card to door faulty and had to be reprogrammed nice old style hotel which i chose as previous stays a while ago were very good used to stay frequently but not stayed in the area for a while non working central heating draught noise of traffic coming in from the windows considering we paid for an upgrade some aspects were very ordinary i e only   earl grey tea bag decoration of room very dated breakfast very good staff helpful ambience of hotel ground floor vey impressive claustrofobic size of a room the fact that every time i wanted to use wi fi i needed to logg in extremely annoying the very thin duvet and lack of a spare blanket no signal on tv locationno negative the hotel s architecture and history the decoration and lucky george the staff is attentive and friendly and the location is excellent we will be back as lead organiser of our group i was rather dissapointed when being given a small room at the back of the hotel on the  th floor the style and architecture of the hotel is exquisite the staff provided good attentive service and were always friendly shabby room communal facilities are nice and the breakfast is good however the room was in a poor state with a lack of attention to details making it look shabby junior suite cold and uncomfortable room no bath and the shower screen was cracked and a possible health hazard could not keep the room warm a very second rate experience the management paid for our replacement room in the holiday inn i booked a junior suite and it was uninhabitable the windows rattled every time the wind blew it was impossible to keep the room warm it was a sad first time experience with your hotel and chain the noise an event was in in the hotel and the music was loud not what i would expect for such a hotel the manager on duty that night was rude and un helpful the bed was uncomfortable and broken the hotel itself is beautiful such a shame the night for us was ruined by loud music and an unhelpful night manager we received a full refund for out night stay no positiveno negative standard single room was not large but had every comfort and the bathroom was spacious and elegant the heating air conditioning was efficient and the atmosphere was peaceful we had one incidence of noise from fellow residents but phoned reception and they sorted it out very quickly the staff were all very helpful the breakfast was good value for money the room was spacious and quiet nothing its a huge gothic hotel pile on the outside but warm and comfortable inside relaxing bar busses leave from outside and go all over london handy for the eurostar paid to upgrade to a suite had to ask for a dressing gown room very shabby no sleep because of traffic noise throughout the night told reception on check out no discount offered nothing no negative we had just one night in london and the hotel s location let us make the most of it took the tube directly from heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the russell square tube station the next day it was an easy walk to st pancras station to catch the train to gatwick we spent our day in london eating shopping and visiting the british museum everything within extremely easy walking distance grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces it occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed stayed on a sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week charming doorman too no negative the staff and atmosphere at this hotel is the best i have experienced for a   hotel this is my second visit and i would most definitely stay there again the steps at the front entrance made it difficult for my girlfriend who uses a wheelchair however the door staff were   wonderful and made it as easy as possible i understand that it s a listed building and not something that can be changed beautiful building with heaps of history we were very lucky to get a room on the top floor on a corner overlooking russell square i am a sucker for a good view the location was by far the best part it was fantastic to be so near to everything my first trip to london where i barely got the underground anywhere dirty bathroom door torn carpet wardrobe door did not close missing reading light at bed leaving a hole dirty bathroom blind left letter of complaint have not had a response   hours later staff and food were lovely house keeping came knocking on our bedroom door at  am sunday morning before i woke up realised what was happening she was letting herself into the room i did get an apology from reception staff it wouldn t put me off staying there though really nice hotel comfortable rooms great location as tube station only around the corner from front door lots of cafe restaurants close by very friendly helpful staff the hotel rooms and corridors are very run down in desperate need of renovation the bed was pushed into the corner meaning one person had to climb over the bed the furniture was damaged and the blind was hanging off of the window not what i expect from a   star hotel was very disappointed the bar and restaurant was nice and can t fault the location the windows of the room we stayed in were badly insulated there was a draft but as we didn t stay in the room much during daytime it was ok everything it s just great to stay at such a place and let yourself being pampered unacceptable level of customer service once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view the room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was freezing cold they send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system we spent approximately   hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed at some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments the hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine at    pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room we spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us   portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters the air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting great location clean rooms the side facing the road is a bit noisy the position of the tv in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down close to british museum and tube station i also like the interior decoration enough sockets for all my devices to charge at the same time i booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters the girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand i also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open this was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too a beautiful building evoking the style of days gone by the location was excellent for travel around london good facility of the underground and commercial parking nearby the breakfast was lovely and if booked as part of a package deal great value for money wonderful staff double room size is not as the pictures lighting in the room is noisy no fridge water in bathroom switches hot to cold suddenly room is cold so i had to open air conditioning to heat excellent free wifi lots of restaurants and cafe nearby   min walking to tube station   min walking to king s cross train station   hour bus reaching the areano negative the actual building with all that marble wide staircases and corridors exudes old world style and luxury the staff are wonderful they look good happy and alert and are unfailingly polite and helpful the room was very cramped hot very noisy the en suite was tiny and had a cracked basin dripping shower we pointed this out to staff but didn t appear interested breakfast was very basic i spend a lot of time in hotels feel this was not even a budget hotel standard location was good for getting around with tube station right next to hotel walking distance to euston kings cross st pancras it will be nice when the furniture up grades are completed staff helpful large room clean bathroom breakfast quality good but pricy for light eaters boiler broke so no hot water the shower temperature control the heating and the towel rail didn t work the bathroom was tiny the location the refund and upgrade on last night shower very poor water pressure low water temp control non existent nice building great bar old times feel to it great atmosphere in the building rooms and general areas very clean very noisy motors all night presumably from air condition outlets shower difficult to control as hot tap was broken but not discovered until the morning when needing to get out for a meeting so no time to ask for it to be fixed bar area insufficient for the size of hotel had hoped for a quiet drink before departure but bar overflowing with guests about to attend a function friendly and helpful staff over and above the expected room was very small for cost and view from window was shocking a brick wall as a result the room was very dark not enough tea coffee and sugar for cost of room beautiful exterior and immediate interior room was shabby broken shower parts tv small and grainy and limited options impressive function room quality of food for a function tasty and well presented good staff thought the room was compact and bijou bathroom was situated right next to one of the beds fell out of bed into the bathroom lovely view of a brick wall and generators for the room and view thought it was overpriced no positive heating wasn t working which took two visits from the technicians to sort out in the space of four and a half hours great location and friendly staff cold dining room at breakfast croissants etc should have been warm efficient stff very helpful comfortable room voucher for harrods bottle of bubbly good deal booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that at arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead we declined so we got what they call standard double the room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer in addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all the overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a   discount i wouldn t come back here anyway and i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody from the outside it s really beautiful once passed the doors it s another story no positive   as usually most of hotels in eur have small rooms   they didn t have fridge   a little be it expensive   good and nice staff   one of the best location in london   you have everything around you our junior suite was exceptionally tired a challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate no water or hot water on the final day dirty walls in bathroom poor recognition of problems by staff zero response mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast location fair althiugh changes in local traffic system rendered taxi s very expensive to and from the hotel because of severe congestion no hot water in the morning as the boilers broke which meant we couldn t get a shower bath before leaving the kettle leaked from the glass indicator so we was unable to use that too for   i expected a lot more no positive the facilities were quite basic so i felt it was quite expensive for what it was the view from our room was very disappointing and it took a long time to speak to anybody in reception the hotels architecture is beautiful it was clean and comfortable no bad experience the tempus bar needs some refurbishment especially the carpet and the fire place needs to be cheerier especially near xmas its a bit dull and dismal overall ulster carpets recently refurbished the castletroy park hotel in limerick ireland they supplied the first carpets which lasted   years and the new carpets which transformed the hotel ditch that dirty burgundy carpet asap the room was neat and compact no hot water for a few hours on a sunday at  am not exactly what you want when wanting a shower no alternative facilities offered bar closed at  amno positive the breakfast was a bit pricy compared to quality the rooms bathroom was cold and the hotel resturant was not good compared to the quality of the rest of hotel the hotel bar was great location was sentral but not too busy the rooms are variable in size and ours was a little small but very comfortable and clean others in our party had bigger rooms the hotel is located within   mins walk to covent garden and a shoet taxi ride to the theatre district if you want to save your high heels the british museum is very close and there is close proximity to shopping and restaurants the hotel has historic links to the titanic through its architecthe which was of interest to my party the staff were very helpful no negative perfect location less than   min to russel sq underground pret a manger and tesco great victorian building great margherita pizza room service all and all a perfect score keep it up mates cheers need to pay   pound for   hour late check out even though having notified hotel in advance other hotels we stayed do not need to pay   pound for   hour late check out they are free for   hour late check out no positive i booked the champagne shopping package i expected champagne not just a sparkling wine this was my only disappointment the location was great the hotel had great character and the staff were friendly our double room was dated only view was of a collection of air con units the tiniest bathroom ever to run a bath one had to get in to do so poor shower once you could get it going basin area so small was difficult to wash face and teeth disgusting dirty grouting between basin and shower screen breakfast area congested and two mornings in a row had to ask for bread totally underwhelmed by this place excellent location tube nearby and walking distance to west end beautiful old hotel with many period features i couldn t connect wifi using room number and my registered email i called reception but didn t help finally i was provided an access code at the front desk better to simplfy the wifi access i stayed with elderly and they arranged an easy access room no negative receptionist services friendly without asking the personel aknowleged my husbands birthday there was waiting a bottle of prosecco and a piece of cake and a card very nice gesture interior of the hotel is very esthetical and beautiful braekfast is not cheap but it is worth for the money the service at the lobby bar at the breakfast concierge services very friendly and helpful we visited london mid november no negative great service from the moment we arrived we upgraded to a junior suite well worth the little extra for a great room very clean and well appointed excellent staff from the house keeping reception bar porters and concierge we could not fault them and will defiantly return took up an offer to upgrade to a deluxe suite which was very poor the manner in which my complaint about the quality of our upgraded room was handled the quality of the room we were move to i booked a room for myself and   sisters it was a superior room with   double beds but it was only set up for   people so we had to ask for everything extra i e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying we booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving that was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying againno positive very over priced stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible room given was not the room pictured in the ad when i reserved as junior suite not even close although i was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware shower bath access was difficult and i am very agile the tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and i am     so if you are short good luck lobby was beautiful from the era built location in relation to train and tour access was very good the single room is small but i was more bothered by the noise from the hallway the walls are very thin also there was a little mold on the shower wall on my first night it was removed after i called the front desk about it the next morning otherwise the bathroom was nice the location is conveniently located to the metro shopping mall restaurants park and the british museum the exterior is beautiful and the bar is nice wish i had been given the potted history booklet on registration as i would have had more of an explore great location hotel was a good standard and i would choose the hotel for my next stay in londonno negative professional and courteous staff who always had a smile on their face especially bernard concierge lovely room which was immaculately clean and extremely comfortable we received a bottle of sparkling wine and some lemon cake in our room for our  th wedding anniversary which was a really nice gesture from the hotel a well presented breakfast with quality items along with good service as to be expected no negative location short  min walk to either st pancras or euston train station the historic building our room   top floor in the tower the fabulous old restaurant and bar with the breakfast nearby pubs no negative the staff were fantastic from the first minute we are a young couple so on first thoughts we didn t think we would fit in but we were treated exactly the same as anyone else the door staff were friendly and enjoyed a laugh as well the room as lovely although the shower wasn t the best it did what we wanted the location couldn t have been any better we were a tube station or two away from everything we wanted we highly recommend this place perhaps we will visit for another birthday next year our room was one of the top twin room paid   a night but no slippers no bath gowns no face cloth very poor toiletries bath tub handle was not clean and rusty water has been dripping and bath room was very cold room has a one very cheap small table which wobble so badly with two armchairs not impressed at all staff are very helpful and efficient very good service first had a room in the loft which was extrememly warm and some kind of machine noise outside if we opened the window not a good night s sleep very expensive breakfast unhappy with first room got moved as soon as a room was available the location and rooms were lovely therefore it was a shame to be disappointed with the check in process taking at least an hour and with a long queue forming behind on check out the long process was repeated along with forgetting to remove an amount from our credit card for sundries although saying they would do so the architecture atmosphere and location the receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park hotel was clean and well located for trip to theatre restaurants staff were friendly helpful only comment was there was no milk provided on our third day in our room the breakfast is excellent and staff very attentive reception staff could be more cheerful and provide a more welcoming greeting the porters very helpful and friendly nothing staff were friendly and professional location was great for central london soho was   mins walk there was a multi storey car park just on the next street which was quite cheap loved the stay here found a cafe just down the road which did a lovely full english for     returned   to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc no real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested a cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture during our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite not a four star experience whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired access to a small sink was in a gap about   inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx     inches on the wall side the choice was between bump or burn comfortable bedroom plenty of room breakfast well organised and an enjoyable meal good location close to the underground i was disappointed with both of the rooms i booked and not sure if i would book again because of this they looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp the photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water the down stares area bar and dinning room is lovely and has a bit of wow factor also the lady on book in was very welcoming and helpful the breakfast was ok but i would except much more from   stars hotel the business point needs update the printer wasn t working the chairs were so bed i was worried i will fall down only irish newspaper the staff was very helpful the place was clean and tidy twin room bathroom was ridiculously tiny a real squeeze to get to the tiny basin good job the heated towel rail wasn t on easy walk from euston buses and tube all nearby calm quiet interior the air conditioning was difficult to control but this may have been down to the unusually mild weekend we enjoyed the russell is a very comfortable hotel with pleasant efficient staff and a great breakfast choice less than one hundred yards from the tube station and for the fitter person within walking distance of the west end rooms could do with a bit updating but that is my personnel opinion from the moment we arrived at the hotel we were looked after really well nothing was too much troublereception staff were very freindly and hall porter and concierge also had a drink in the bar on the saturday night and again very freindly and helpful lovely atmosphere in the bar the supposedly double bed room was too narrow and the room was closer to a single than to a double bed room the tv too small no mini bar even the towels were for one person plus the inside view was awful and there was a continuous noise from the power installations but after my complaints they transferred me to one much better location and staff our room was very hot couldn t keep the window open because of the noise the room backed on to the courtyard with all the generators hammering away the air con unit didn t do much continental breakfast was average loved the character and history of the place and the location loads of great pubs and restaurants mostly italian nearby friendly efficient and polite staff staff in the morning on arrival friendly and helpful staff at night appeared to be unhappy in their job and with each other location and being able to get a quiet room bar area small for a big hotel we wanted to take a coffee in there one afternoon but all the seats where taken but only around   people in there excellent staff very helpful we went to london to celebrate my husbands birthday and the extra touches in the room helped to make it a special time i was in one of the inner rooms and experienced one of the worst nights sleep i have ever had at a hotel due to the noise of the generators all night no positive beds very uncomfortable room very hot we did not have a window that you could see through location was perfect very close to tube station staff very friendly and helpful the breakfast was adequate but not fantastic it s probably a good idea to get down early for the breakfast the location is excellent right next to the tube or a walk away from euston station we had treat the partner package which received a good response the hotel is also very grand looking would certainly come back breakfast was almost   extra per person so we didn t have breakfast hotel itself including rooms reception and general building ideal location for the part of london we were visiting if i had to complain id say that a bit of noise comes off the corridor i m not sure if it s the thickness of the walls or the acoustical rating on the door incredible staff who were very friendly and helpful even early in the morning i only stayed one night so i m not sure what the rest of the facilities are like but i image they are great location is perfect for touring london and conveniently located next to a tube station oh and on a side note the little soap lotion and shampoo smell amazing lack of double glazing meant it was a bit noisy but it is london good location right near russell square tube station big room with plenty of space the rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment but that s being quite picky the hotel is in a very convenient location for central london and was great value for money our booking was made at a very reasonable rate and we just wanted rooms for one night but they were also able to give us rooms with baths on a special request the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either the location was good close to the tube looked like a room from the  s dim and dismal decor old utility furniture filthy windows looked out onto a service shaft extremely poor value for mopney i stay every few weeks in london usually closer to west end either charing cross or horseguards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay tv was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare room was v quiet air con worked but fan would only work on full or not at all tv was a little hard to understand but that s being picky had a lovely stay for a night to catch a show and shop we checked in to a beautiful room overlooking the park the room was spotless and we had lots space the location is fantastic great value for money some small details disturbing the last day the room was not completely clean the small cookie miete on the nightstand welcoming staff and available and responsive nice room and comfortable bed nothing at all to complain about welcoming atmosphere and good reception and really helpful concierge team good choice of breakfast locations and effectively managed no negative the location is excellent it s a very comfortable and beautiful hotel with affordable price near you can find russel square station from where you can go anywhere and it s just a short walk from stores and restaurants and the food there is excellent the bedding and bathroom were immaculate however the wooden sash windows were loose fitting and rattled so we wedged with tissues they were also really filthy on the outside masking the magnificent london skyline view from the sixth floor the kettle also had a significant leak when filled for   cups the location is ideal the architecture is stunning the staff are very friendly and welcoming the breakfast is delicious and gives a great deal of choice tired d cor loud air conditioning unit outside room whitewashed windows so we could not see outside this was a bit oppressive location room size staff rather expensive with small room and no breakfast included we have stayed nearby in similar rated hotels with better facilities and with breakfast included convenient location and grand building the curtains didn t quite cover the window so despite the blackout blind i was awake as soon as it got light location was perfect for our trip we weren t hassled by anyone but there was always staff around if you needed anything and they were more than happy to help breakfast did not meet the price little variaty in food room windows were out towards a shaft were the ventilation was very noisy all night saturday night we had the pleasure of listening to the loud music from a nearby or in the house disco lovely hotel very helpfull and friendly staff nice clean rooms near undergound entrance and underground all the way to heathrow very good coffe at breakfast no negative i have stayed at the russell many times and enjoyed it but my room a superior double was disappointing the tv only worked on three channels the towel email didn t work in the bathroom and the ch was inefficient disappointing and i d paid a premium for a so called upgrade tried to contact room service but the phone rang for   minutes as the reception was busy all the numbers go through   including emergency and first aid requests there should be separate numbers for differing functions or more staff answering the phone comfortable beds great location paint is pilling in our room ceiling constant noise of slamming doors due to the aggressive automatic door closer very very nice stuff reasonable location near a small park near the british museum and the underground beautiful lobby was shown a very small room when i arrived i felt it was too claustrophobic so i upgraded but for the price i paid it wasn t good plus i had to pay extra for breakfast loved the staff especially the concierge and porter once i upgraded it was a very comfy large room overpriced bad nights sleep due to noise from the street and a strange squeaking noise which carried on day and night nice breakfast good location no negative the location and apparent of the hotel were excellent the staff were very friendly there was a small problem with the shower in the room which was seen to with no hesitation or worry we had a tiny room not comfortable at all the room would perhaps suit a single but not a double occupancy and should not be sold as such wonderful and friendly staff great location for our visit could not get bb  bb  and itv on television in room had to go to reception   times before it was sorted good location big room and bed fantastic architecture of building our children   and   shared a twin room on the same floor but their tea and coffee supply was not replenished the location was super an easy walk to covent garden     mins we were always able to get a taxi immediately at the front entrance and it is a two minute walk to russell street tube or a   minute walk to holborn i stayed there   nights and these guys charged me   punds on my credit card as security deposit during the check in plus it has been   days after check out but   pouns has not been put back how great to know i almost have no limit on my credit cardno positive the room was extremely small and as were staying for   nights was extremely cramped i had requested an upper floor room but was given a room on the first floor which i do nor class as an upper floor our room was at the back of the hotel directly opposite a pub it was extremely noisy until the early hours and then the noise began again prior to  am when they were obviously taking the empty bottle out pleasant staff good location for shows the room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets if i needed to plug in my laptop i had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk that made the room even darker in   a guest expects better also your website says that the checkout time is     whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s     this inconsistency should be corrected no positive there s a lot more that could be done unemptied bins ashtrays basic amenities single bedrooms are very small i was expecting small but still surprised staffing reception staff esp trainees very welcoming and helpful bar staff also stunning building and lobby my error in believing my reservation included one more night but the hr handled this with grace despite my embarrassment loved the staff the concierges serge v dario bernard and max all of them wonderful and lorenzo at the front desk i plan to post a physical letter to the hotel to cite all these people and like arnold s i ll be back i had to print important information and was told the there were internet printing facilities yet the printer continued to give me an error message and i was unsuccessful in printing the documents i also didn t like that i was unable to go out on the balcony i loved the exterior and interior traffic noise as windows not double glazed some stains on upholstery windows in junior suite were dirty junior suite was a bit shabby drinks were expensive the location style flowers food staff size of rooms beds no negative elegant yet welcoming hotel in an ideal location steps from the tube direct to heathrow and minutes from museums or the train stations that can take you onward very comfortable stay and a lovely staff  th floor bedrooms service exemplary when checking in all the deluxe rooms were taken accept on the  th floor the  th floor rooms are very small and ikea ish down graded to a standard room on the  th floor which was large and comfortable like a suite compared to the other when we arrived back at the room there were petals everywhere champagne birthday cake as my wife s birthday chocolates and a letter for a free upgrade next time excellent no negative very convenient location for central london impressive grand and historic hotel with very nice lobby and bar area helpful and friendly staff not cheap but reasonable for the quality of hotel in london the air conditioning in the room was broken the room was very warm during the night and we were unable to put the system on is it was making a banging noise what the hotel had to offer the quality of the surroundings food and complimentary drink on arrival the room was small but had everything it stated had on the website first room had an awful bathroom with tired and shabby decor including peeling paint on walls bedroom was cold and basic on request was moved to much better room with great bathroom and a slightly better bedroom not sure how there can be such a jump in standard for the same price staff super friendly location very central hotel entrance impressive there was no halaal breakfast all meat was pork poor show this needs to be looked beef lamb or chicken should be availible in a major city like london a special thanks to the following staff who made my stay special miles on reception thanks for your friendly help and assistance max the italian concierge thanks for all your help and directions as well as assistance with all my baggage a true asset to any hotel the young doorman who greeted me every day with a smile a specil thanks to bebita and kim on management for going the extra mile great management team hot water tap on bath shower did not work when i complained upon booking out i was told there was nothing that could be done i was only staying there to have a nights rest sleep whilst my daughter was critically ill at gosh very disappointed no positive tiny room uncomfortable bedding pillows could have done with being replaced you could hear everything from the corridor and people stumbling into the adjoining rooms great location beautiful old building room was clean but the pillows and quilt were very old and need replacing the heater didnt work nor did the television the towel rail was cold and no way to turn it on quiet room as requested easy check in and check out friendly staff great location no negative the hotel itself was stunning and very well kept the rooms were a great size and very well laid out the staff were very friendly and helpful myself and my partner had an excellent experience here and will definitely be returning the room was freezing on arrival touch ages to work the system out and at least an hour to warm up the room the shower was cranky and quite old took forever to wash my hair overall decent hotel but the price reflects the location not the hotel i wouldn t pay that amount anywhere else for the type of hotel but it is expected i suppose in central london the staff were lovely and the location was great the beds were comfy and the breakfast was good no negative the hotel s location exceptional staff clean rooms with comfortable beds as well as being a quiet venue make this hotel one we will surely return to the room was a bit small but not cramped the room was spacious but chilly and the traffic noise from outside prevented us from having a good nights sleep there were two very large windows in the room both single glazed so outside noise was easily heard in the room the room was very clean and spacious there wasn t anything we didn t like and would stay at the hotel russell again staff very helpful and courteous room was pleasantly decorated and bed very comfortable the bathroom was beautifully decorated not exactly a bad experience but i was disappointed with the quality of facial and toilet tissues provided really cheap and nasty i expect more from a hotel of this rating staff were friendly and helpful not having a bath suite lovely looking hotel and the inside decor was tradional the staff were friendly and very helpful our hotel room was very spacious and the decor was nice excellent location only a couple of minutes walk to tube station the air con was rather noisy so we couldn t really use it even though the room was rather warm the location and how comfortable the hotel is large bathroom the single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com it was really claustrophobic and tiny i could not upgrade and there was no fridge the worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when i went to the front office to ask if i should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if i booked online he would honour it but he would rush before me to close the bookings worse hotel experience ever the bell boy and the staff in charge of the cloak room where friendly and helpful let down by lack of attention to detail bedroom was cramped and lacked sufficient storage space if we had been staying more than one night we would not have had enough room to hang store clothes bathroom had no soap holder so soap was left in a puddle on sink no additional bar of soap for shower great location dinner which i told the head of drinks and catering was an absolute disgrace we didn t eat there again the location and the way the staff helped when we had a small problem with our room the matter was quickly resolved to our satisfaction the standard room was very small so upgraded which cost another   pound even though i d received an email saying it would visit   pound the stay turned out to be very expensive i ve paid at   less to stay in a better hotel the victorian facade couldn t open any windows they were screwed shut couldn t see out of any windows as a film had been put over them not happy about this at all felt shut off from the world and had to go downstairs to the main door to see what the weather was like it was also stifling hot in the morning because of this walls seemed very thin and could hear every little noise in the corridors when trying to sleep fantastic hotel in a great central location for oxford street and covent garden the staff were very efficient and helpful lovely size twin room very clean bed was very small uncomfortable and noisy quite important when you re paying to sleep room was small and loud due to the generators outside the window it was hot but you couldn t have the window open due to the noise air con sounded like an aeroplane was landing so couldn t have that on either great location and breakfast was very good we were originally allocated a double room on the fifth floor which certainly left a lot to be desired the window was filthy and all the knobs on the furniture were either broken or loose not worth     we were moved to the first floor purely because we requested a safety deposit box no positive some signs of wear and tear cleanliness could be a bit better ornate hotel with lovely external appearance refurbished new room top floor central location the price did not include breakfast it was not expensive and we paid extra for it but it would have been far better if it had been included the staff were very friendly and helpful it was my friends birthday treat and he found a piece of cake in his room which was totally unexpected a lovely gesture the bed of the single room is so short that i would not fit in it and i am  cm not exceptionally tall it should be clearly written about the small bed no positive hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of english the receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at hotel russell just a week prior when we first arrived in london for the first half of our stay had to request management to sort this out her attitude was non too friendly during this experience as mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well the movie which cost a staggering   could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered when i called to check on the reason i was told that it was after    pm and therefore it could not be delivered the original order had been called in before    pm as if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which i had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on friday we were told the reservations were for saturday though i had an email confirmation of that friday being our arrival date we were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved the location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at hotel russell location no negative this hotel was perfect for us we could walk to many sites and museums and the tube stop was right around the corner if we didn t walk it s a   minute walk to euston station or king s cross the hotel is very elegant with a beautiful lobby our room was really comfortable and quiet the bathroom was good sized we had a mini fridge and a tea kettle so we could have tea in our room the wifi was good really everything we needed to be comfortable was provided and we were in a great location we loved it and would definitely stay here next time we re in london cramped small bed bar understaffed and waiter overwhelmed forgot one drink from order and it too   requests   minutes and asking the mixologist directly the get the drink great location quiet room had everything you need in roomno negative the kindness of the staff giving us a late complimentary check out because i was sick the cheerful breakfast staff even though they were very busy no negative we stayed here for our  st wedding anniversary it was absolutely fantastic lovely staff couldn t do enough for you everything was amazing from start to finish we will definitely be back they offered us an upgrade which i paid for as it was my  th birthday and i thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst ive had there and i have stayed a good number of times the bathroom was in a shocking state the main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open all in all as great disappointment its a good location the blinds in the bathroom needed replacing as they were very frayed also the ceiling needed repainting as there had obviously been a leak from the bathroom above room spacious and clean air of grandeur about the hotel only thing was windows in bathroom need cleaned a lot of black mould on inside of them location friendliness of staff beds very comfortable breakfast good next to the tube station which was brillianthotel is beautiful inside and has a commanding appearanceno negative we went for my boyfriends birthday we arrived a bit earlier than in check time but our room was already set up as it was my boyfriends birthday they gave him a complimentary slice of cake which was lovely superb location very friendly staff internal rooms had noisy central air conditioning units outside window located very close to all transport and walking distance to attractions ideal for eurostar we lived on the  th floor and windows were blocked moreover when you turn on conditioner if smells dump so the room stayed humid all the time staff is fantastic on request to bring in room more coffee and few extra cups we were surprised with knocking at the door less than in   minutes the hot water was only warm in the shower bath was very hot by contrast and it didn t drain well the room was beautiful and the bed was very comfy i booked the junior suite on a last minute offer and got it for a good price however i would not have paid the full price okay you are in central london but the bathroom could have a better finish and the tv didn t have a great reception lovely hotel in a convenient location in the centre of london relaxing hotel bar very friendly staff very comfortable bed spacious room room was very small but adequate for a one night stay breakfast was not included in the price but was available at extra cost staff were smart extremely polite and helpful hotel was ideally situated for what we wanted to do and easy walking distance from kings cross we were given what i would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend it had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath the sink in the bath bathroom did not work the staff basically said oh well the room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair the room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat they should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service the hotel beckoned to a bygone era and has retained some of that charm had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit at   for our   night stay i didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room i have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had there was a bath too i am only   feet tall and i couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense the bed was comfortable everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall will not return here fantastic location could not be better it needs a little revamping and we were told a big renovation plan was soon on the way the location is great and the russell is one of the well known historical hotels in london the room was pure value for money i booked a double deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious it was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken i expect much better than this for a room that costs more than   per night the hotel is in a great location just in front of russell square and near the british museum and oxford street it also has a nice bar no negative took the english breakfast and found it was a good way to start the day the front desk lent me an adapter so i could recharge my north american laptop and this was greatly appreciated found that the heathrow express which i had booked wouldn t work for me and the staff arranged an early morning taxi again greatly appreciated room was average for a   star hotel   was blocked against my credit card on arrival i paid the actual   night cost of   the next morning with a debit card but was told it would take up to   week for the   to be released from my credit card location was good small room dated dark decor very much a quick business stay or ideal fro travellers i prefer crown plaza level of comfort very easy to walk to oxford street goodge street restaurants st pals and the old bailey and just   minutes walk from euston room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot whilst compared to other clients   for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the   stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are the hotel itself location staff were all great i have travelled extensively and stayed in many hotels the public areas in this hotel are very impressive room was small with no view it was decorated cheaply very out of date and tired no mirror to get ready in staff were great and the lobby area and bar were great the design of the bathroom is appaling room   we could not wash our hands although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful it is a spacious hotel and generlly clean it has a good bar the concierge is good the showers didn t get very hot very friendly staff good sized room good location clean building and room good value for the money being in london and right by tube station the staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our   night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take   small single rooms no apology i emailed   times about my booking no response i rang the hotel   times as my flight was delayed no answer we paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay i would not stay at this hotel again the bed was comfortableno negative i did ask for a slightly earlier check in   instead of standard  pm as i had just travelled from australia they had not received this request i only had to wait for one hour instead of two this was greatly appreciated lovely bathroom for a small room no negative i had wanted to stay here ever since i saw the exterior two years ago the internet price came down just before my august trip so i grabbed it the hotel did not disappoint it was better than i had hoped the room staff were efficient and sweet the desk staff helpful the door staff adequate not very friendly actually the bar excellent i didn t try the restaurant the room was well appointed and i loved the kettle and the provided tea sugar shortbread the shower directions were hilariously confusing but i got the thing to work just fine excellent i will hope to stay there again nothing hotel location has great access to tube lines and the british museum is an easy five minute walk cafe nero is kitty corner for delicious coffee makes for an inexpensive continental breakfast hotel bar is a quiet comfortable spot for a pre post dinner cocktail and be sure to rub the brass dragon located on the second floor in the stair well it s mate is at the bottom of the atlantic aboard the titanic they did not book correct and desired room and expected us to pay for it anyways we were promised the room we intended the following day but that was a false promise view when eating breakfast room was so noisy the constant road noise is terrible no sleep no double glazing just old sash windows facilities where good and excellent staff and food room they gave me was quite small and a little out dated needs a spruce up this is a great hotel it s ideally situated as it s walking distance from kings cross st pancras and russell square surrounded by great places to see and restaurants extremely comfortable rooms and great customer service not easy to get the wifi to work on my iphone poorly stocked in room tea coffee supply near tube station and a supermarket good location very pleasant hotel receptionists considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap although i did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present you could probably request some of the above however i do not think you should have to the location the decor friendly staff and overall cleanliness horribly loud air conditioner called desk to find out cost to call our car rental they told me no charge and then charged l  each about   total for two calls when we got our bill they did take it off after some convincing ridiculous charge for breakfast so we opted for local starbucks good housekeeping nice coffee service in room great concierge serge easy access to underground and buses the cistern of the toilet dripped all night told staff but indifferent and wasn t fixed overall the staff were unhelpful and tried to overcharge me no fridge even though provision for one was there small double bed close to hop on off bus to the city the two windows opened up for fresh air lovely decor in lobby empty drinks bottle under bed lifts sign difficult to find and room signs arrows pointing wrong way did a circuit needed to go in opposite direction to   than was on sign mouse in bar ran up my seat location booked six months in advance with specific requirements but which were ignored in fact hotel said they did not receive them from booking com some staff less than helpful good location grand victorian architechture lifts far too small didn t like having to use lift at russell square underground bathroom very tiny could hardly move shower screen didn t open so very difficult to use love this beautiful old hotel stayed on previous occasionsno negative excellent position next to russell square tube station hotel excellent in every way have stayed here several times and dont need to look anywhere else when trravelling to london nothing very grand hotel beautiful architecture entrance and magnificent marble staircase good service in the bar and not expensive by london standards room was fine apart from the tv not working didn t have time to view it anyway lots of good bars and restaurants in the local area and convenient for both piccadilly and central line stations a bit worn out single windows our room was on  nd floor on pub street side and some noice was coming rooms on  nd facing inside yard had a really awful view location near russell square tube station easy to access from heathrow by piccadilly line tube breakfast wasn t included in the price there was three of us staying in the same room and the receptionist let us all pay our own share which made it easier for   a night thought the room was a bit basic couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink thought the bed wasnt the best squeaked every time you moved the building was grand and staff was so friendly and helpful the breakfast was good and location the building looked very grand liked the extra touches eg petals on the bed for a four star hotel the room was tired and needed decorating the furniture was dark and similarly tired the lightfittings needed replacing room between bath and sink was minimal making it difficult to access sink standard rooms very disappointing good location friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast traffic noise from the street i was on the  rd floor the overall feel of the hotel is a bit old entry foyer felt dark and depressing others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings reception and concierge staff were very welcoming and friendly the location can t be beat for tube nearby and boris bike stands there s a pret a manger for quick bites and breakfrast and brunswick square also has loads of shops room size was smaller than expected the lighting was harsh with the overhead lights bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable our safe could not be fixed which caused us to put our valuables in the managers safe very inconvenient location was excellent the hotel bar was comfortable service good and food great bathroom was nicely appointed with luxurious towels the room is like what they have in italy i mean the single room is really small the overall cleanliess is ok i wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho and the fact that a   star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying the locoation was great i used to pass the building when i was studying here i felt really comfortable with a familiar environment the idea of free wi fi not being free after the first complimentary hour not clear at time of booking or booking in location fine staff helpful room fine good kettle size although no english tea helpful concierges had issues getting into the wifi very grand and impressive hotel in a great location to get out and see london also requested an ice bucket and champagne flutes in the room to celebrate my girlfriends birthday which were left along with some complimentary cakes and a white chocolate note reading happy birthday a very nice touch the room is terribly run down my family has stayed at the russell hotel since the war and i have known it since the  s i ve never seen it look so drab assume it is cost cutting by a chain the staff we met notably french speaking concierge were outstandingly friendly helpful personable efficient funny and a great credit to the hotel the room they gave us was on the  st floor no   it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel it was s very dark room it had only   windows and you could look out only through the one the only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night the elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about   steps as well i do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal anyway it was not cheap also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport they told us it will cost   pounds we were   persons and we told them that we had   luggage   big and   small when the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us   pounds because he said we had an extra bag in my opinion this is unacceptable i would not stay in this hotel again the location i was put in a room with a tiny bathroom with an overhead shower it was not possible there to help my daughter who has a disability i have said about the disability in my request form it took   hours and a lot of my short holiday time to sort things out the initial receptionist s fault to give us a inappropriate room please train them to be more sensitive to guests needs locationno negative hotel russell is a lovely old hotel with a wonderful location minutes to the british museum and with the tube right around the corner the standard double was fine clean comfortable and roomy enough for our week in london my wife especially appreciated the deep tub in the large bathroom for the rate i paid it wouldn t be fair to complain about something location was great and for a the room for single in central london it was very comfortable not really that much of a problem but the bath takes up to much space in the bathroom so it is not so comfortable using the washing basin beautifully hotel nice bar and nice rooms the staff is very friendly the staff didn t speak english very well the junior suite was more like a double room and be sure to ask for a view to the square cause the air vent in the back yard will keep you awake all night the hotel itself need a bit of upgrade it s not a   star hotel the placement of the hotel is perfect the hotel has seen better days the d cor generally was tired various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use the room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on the staff were generally uninterested on early arrival i asked if i could have access to the room to get changed as i had cut my leg while travelling i wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it two of the three staff members i asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury the third staff member offered me a band aid and use of the ladies toilets its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle five minutes in the room or any room and i would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue i particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room he implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while i m standing at reception bleeding i wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened i further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay they didn t instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake i remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened breakfast was average service remained indifferent not what i expect from a four star hotel i wouldn t recommend or return to it   seconds from tube station wifi was rubbish only free for an hour bath was really small neither of us fitted in it bed lovely and comfy breakfast really good staff reception bar waiter all really great toilet in bathroom was just not acceptable no distance between it and wash hand basin i really like a cup and saucer rather than a mug for my breakfast the location suited us very well the staff were very friendly difficulty getting in to the hotel as no wheelchair access that we could find and a lot of steps larger room than expected and with fabulous disabled facilities in wetroom comfortable bed and very quiet so had good nights sleepno negative went to extra effort knowing it was my wife s birthday gifts etc great location from euston and to covent gdn and theatre breakfast was exceptional wi fi does not work very well the room is comfortable with air conditioner that many of the hotels in london do not have bathroom is clean the heating rail for bath towel is very thoughtful hotel staff are polite and helpful no negative the location was great for our trip we wanted to visit lings college london on the strand theatre land and oxford street they were all within walking dustance would have liked a mini fridge and location of the hair dryer and iron was very awkward loved the historic character of the building it was well maintained the room was comfortable if a bit small bathroom was large room service was good good location and great value for the price decor a bit gloomy i paid   for the room yet was asked to pay a   deposit on arrival i don t like that decor a bit gloomy but otherwise perfectly serviceable great location there were a few niggles the balcony window didn t shut properly and neither did the shower door but neither affected our stay and we slept great in a very cosy comfy room bar was pricey but it is london i guess the staff couldn t have done more for us friendly and kind with little extras that made our stay all the nicer grand look a cozy room and a nice bar too really impressive and would definitely stay there again absolute bargain i must admit i had higher expectations i feel i get so much more comfort and luxury for my money in other cities e g berlin paris gothenburg a ono positive noise from big fans running all night from courtyard outside bedroom window kept us awake location was excellent hotel was very clean and friendly breakfast was good value for money if booked in advance no negative fantastic location got a deal on room rate so made stay value for money would recommend as right next to shops and tube station walking distance from euston no negative such an excellent location   minute to a tube station so easy to get around comfortable quiet rooms with extremely helpful staff we will return again and again too many items missing every day e g no towels no water glass no toiletries no coffee door key did not work for me or for the kind member of staff who came up tp help i was constantly ringing the desk or going down to ask for something necessary the staff could not have been more helpful but supplies were poor and something i needed was missing every day comfort and location understaffing at reception means long waits to check in and check out the location and overall quality of the hotel has kept me coming back to it again and again for sheer convenience it is difficult to beat loo flush wasn t very effective bit of an acquired skill not enough plug sockets in room coffee terrible lovely big room plenty of storage big bathroom clean and comfortable the room was the only let down it was very small and quite dingy the bed and bathroom was perfect although the window only opened slightly and there was a constant noise from a fan which was located above our window definitely recommend upgrading your room if you get the chance the entrance and outside of the hotel was amazing it is located a   minute walk away from euston and right outside a tube station staff were friendly and nice and the concierge desk took our luggage even after we had checked out so we didn t have to carry it all over london on our last day the bed was comfy but very noisy every time i turned it woke me up the grand staircase it is absolutely stunning and all those only using the lift would probably not get to see it didn t have breakfast included in deal therefore   if booked night before or   the day of it continental was in one area and cooked in another had better for half the price in an ibis good location staff helpful offered a cot   alternative was a   upgrade bar closed early despite residents and staff still there so offered room service at inflated price our last experience was great this one poor money grabbing up selling procedures in place to steal your last pound notes lifts were too small room decor nice and clean external facade humming noise in my room first night so i asked for a change in both rooms i had always to try the card key three or four times before it worked temperature in old fashioned shower difficult to control the location the ambience bath and bath mat very slippy even holding onto rail the mat slipped and i jarred my leg first time had hip replacement so a bit scary warned family but daughter aged   also slipped hurting her leg and banging her head also no toilet brush beautiful traditional hotel loved being greeted and helped with luggage by concierge no queues when checking in or out hotel staff happy and helpful really nice bar area very comfortable for passing a couple of hours on a rainy day only down side bath plug broken so water drained out while trying to have a bath and very slippy even with bath mat i slipped twice and my daughter had a bad fall hitting her head other than that was a lovely big room with a fab view of russell square not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance free wifi lovely heritage building good location for walking to shopping on bus route and close to underground concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance the hotel was rather tired and shabby around the edges needs redecorating and there was no hot water during the day but the staff did ammend my bill accordingly great location lovely friendly staff especially rocio who served us at our first breakfast and miles who made us laugh at the reception lovely building quiet considering being in london no negative hotel was excellent travelled for my birthday had a cake and bottle of wine in the room staff were brilliant stay in ph hotels a lot because they are brilliant hotels tv not brilliant bed not that comfortable for me anyway i prefer a hard bed breakfast felt like i was in an exam hall great central location staff very helpful and friendly good sized room in evening about   pm they did not find anyone to get my luggage to the room the location it is almost the centre but in a quiet place with perfect transport correspondenceno negative the comfort of the room was lovely and the decor was beautiful even though the noise from the roads outside could be heard it wasn t loud at all and we slept soundly the hotel looks and feels like it should be a lot more expensive for what it is and that s a testiment to the hotel a fantastic stay although notified an early check in i had to wait until     overall aspect of the room is outdated good location very easy to reach the tube and british museum no problems great location a block away from the russell square tube station on the piccadilly line easy to access buses too british museum is a close and easy walk away euston st pancras and king s cross train stations are nearby beautiful marble y interior excellent and friendly staff everything worked well appointed bathroom bathroom was small location is great next to a tube station and walking distance from euston good staff comfy and clean room got a deal via a website so well worth the stay good base to explore we had a very smelly room with an unacceptable view of water pipes with green stuff all over there are no fridges so we ordered an ice bucket which after the ice melted turned out to be unclean and had tissues and garbage at the bottom the rooms were not cleaned as it is supposed to be and the wifi wasn t working until we got a voucher key at the end they charged us   gbp for smoking which they hadn t stated it was a non smoking hotel the bathroom spaces are horrible which we couldn t fit into the bathroom to just wash our face in the morning how are we supposed to pay a lot of money if we don t get any good service or a decent hotel room suitable for regular sized humans not skeletons i wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone i know unless i want them to have a bad time in london to be honest it had a strategic place near the russel square underground station and a little bit a way walking to oxford street it looks luxurious from the outside while it s not on the inside checking in and out was appalling i was told breakfast wasn t included when it was i also paid   cash deposit on checking in and when checking out was asked to pay in full again as they had no record made to feel like someone who was trying to con them i have written to complain the hotel itself is stunning with the marble staircases and ornate ceilings breakfast was great too the only let down with the hotel was breakfast we had it delivered to the room and it wasn t good raw egg isn t for me lovely hotel great location clean with friendly staff when we first arrived we were asked of we wanted to pay on arrival or when we left we said when we left and were asked to leave a guarantee of a credit card which we dont have so we had a little trouble but paid for our first night in cash and paid the following morning for the next night we loved the room the bed was very comfortable the room was spacious the bathroom was very big location was excellent beautiful hotel some traffic noise but no more than you would expect in central london shower temperature had a mind of its own i wanted to pay by debit card and the margin they tried to add to the bill to cover possible additional spend was excessive location is ideal in the heart of bloomsbury my single room was good with reasonable of space bathroom was very good i didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that i had when i approached the hotel there was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting the view was disgusting at night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view we did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available we reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room the presence of the building the history location was great for us the staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome the bar was quite nice too when full and busy with other guests roomes dated flaking paint no biscuits small wardrobe plumbing makes terrible sounds when other people use there bathrooms keeps you awake or wakes you up in the middle of the night just very very tied there are better priced hotels in the same location location great for the west end soho chinatown room was tiny and poorly designed bathroom had no shaving mirror and was very poorly finished some rotten wood etc room smelled of stale smoke cost and location air conditioning excellent only issue was very firm mattress staff very helpful good service luggage store available next to russell square tube station inc english breakfast but good cafe available in square opposite can t think of anything friendly and efficient staff lovely room and a fantastic location the hotel even surprised us with a welcoming slice of cake decorated with happy first anniversary i nearly cried breakfast was average there were a lot of staff working at breakfast time but trying to order poached eggs from a member of staff proved a challenge each morning the lunch here is poor and very expensive if you are to stay here best to eat elsewhere great location tube stop is just around the corner paid extra   for upgrade as my wife birthday room was large but refurb above caused a lot of noise at  am and double glazing had  inch gap so road noise was extreme after complaining when checking out manager offered   refund i complained we shouldn t have been given that room no response also on first floor the metro can be clearly heard at  am choose your room carefully location good for theatre and british museum noisy narrow rooms with huge airconditioning machines next to the internal part of the hotel that make increadible noice overnight old windows without sound isolation location is ok what i would suggest the hotel to look at long queues at the reception desk breakfast could have been better the hotels appearance is amazing the staff was nice and helpful the first double room was tiny but the staff kindly switched us to a nicer twin bed room on our demand on the second day bed soft and lumpy like most in england no satellite cable tv is a bit of an oversight location to tube and restaurants in lambs conduit streetno negative amazing value for money very helpful staff superb location right next to tube station even received s birthday surprise in our room thank you very much hotel russell x the bed was awful could not sleep because of the noise it made everything one of us moved the bathroom was small although had everything we required the location the hotel itself and the staff are great i dont have any thing to say about this hotel it is full of happiness this was my all life best hotel and beautiful balding i love to stay again and very central under ground is very near big supermarket is very near what us you need in central london the room was tiny smaller than my bedroom at home so was disappointed considering the price we paid definitely not what i would expect for   stars would have complained but got there late after a long journey so couldn t be faced with dragging all our bags back down to reception it was a really good location and a beautiful hotel room was also really clean room although i was told on check in recently refurbished was still tired looking and the lighting is terrible carpet old and scruffy looking sorry would not return location basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge this hotel trades on its location near the british muaeum and it s beautiful victorian facade once inside the bedrooms it is cramped and basic there are much better hotels in the area for the same price upon arrival we turned ac on freshened up and went out for the day when we returned ac was still not working london was going through a heat spell called front desk someone came up with a fan and told us there was nothing they could do so we suffered in the warmth of the night did not help that windows were only able to open about   inches next morning as we were preparing to head out maintenance came informed them to stop back as we were getting ready to leave for the day when we returned later that night ac still did not work i was told that it would not be repaired until the following week after i went to front desk to complain my family was later moved to two separate rooms at     at night instead of one room this is a very old hotel and it shows we were comped breakfast for two days for three people for our inconvenience overall i would not recommend this place no positive had a room next to air conditioning unit even though requested a quite room staff were good andmoved usto another room staff were friendly and helpful not somewhere where i d like to spend time but a good place to crash for the night everything was right with the room bed was comfy and the marble lobby quite a sight for tired eyes had to change rooms twice once because door key did not function and second time because the room was too small for two very little space for clothes even in the final large room the staff on reception did everything possible to remedy problems fast and efficiently room had a drain smell in the bathroom staff are polite and courteous room was nice and bed was comfy good selection at breakfast freshly cooked and hot the hotel could do with looking at second glazing poor fitting window very loud traffic sounds at night thus couldnot sleep very well good location for site visiting air conditioning unit was leaking it was reported to reception at approx     who said someone would be up to the room but no one appeared at all beds were uncomfortable bathroom tiny location was good breakfast was good rooms were fairly quiet recommendation from concierge for verdi restaurant overpriced for mediocre food saw italian restaurant next to lamb pub that looked a lot better for similar prices everything we would highly recommend it to anyone going to london facilities great staff very accommodating and pleasant room was shabby and needs the bathroom upgraded very small bathroom and poor free toiletries not impressed for   star hotel disappointing location was good staff so helpful and polite we booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed in the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed this request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible an alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place great location friendly staff the room was tiny and on the day of checkout they told us there was no hot water after     which meant we had to get up and leave long before the     checkout time probably a ploy on their part on sunday we came back at     to change for dinner and found the room was still being serviced great location easy access to underground and walking distance for theatres restaurants etc no negative booked a late room with fizz on ice chocolates and rose petals excellent staff very happy and helpful even getting us champagne flutes at breakfast we will be back put at the back of the hotel above wher you have your deliveries the early morning noise was terrible also backed on to a public house which was also noises at closing time had poor sleep for the duration of our stay location was spot on we had the window open by choice and were awoken by shouting and arguing in the square in the early hours of the morning polite and helpful staff the hotel has an ambiance that helps to relax the staff were chatty and friendly will return few more coffee and tea in room no tissues no conditioner price of stay quoted did not include vat on bill location history and architecture of building sound insulationno negative great location with sights shopping and the city in walking distance excellent discount from the standard rate through booking com the hotel itself has lots of character difficult to beat at the price paid on this occasion steps at main entrance bell staff is very helpful with luggage but impossible for ambulatory handicapped very convenient to piccadilly line tube at russel square british museum and university grand public rooms of a previous era breakfast was not included didn t realise and was very expensive   for a bowl of cereal was also put in a room that smelled terribly of smoke and because it was the last room of its type was forced to upgrade my room which cost   night good locationno negative excellent location near kings cross st pancras very close to russell square underground and bus stops overlooking park grand impressive building room comfortable staff charming and helpful this hotel is starting to look very grotty carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved i have stayed for several years at hotel russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment also the shower facilities are rubbish there is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap no positive i was charged   as pre auth on arrival and then next day i was charged the room rate of   so i have been charged   expecting only to be charged   which left me short during my stay this is unacceptable practice i have been advised that it will take   working days for the pre auth payment to be refunded which is a disgrace location we booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one however we were given one on the  th floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin as this was for our  th wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained the response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary pity we had to complain though good location not flexable in late checkout i have to pay   poounds per hour starting     position less than   minutes from russell square station on piccadilly line which can be used to reach heathrow airport within one hour i ve stayed here twice and ever single time i get charged for a breakfast i did not have great location room was spacious staff is helpfull beautiful building small lobby area for relaxing uninspiring bar airco not effective in room efficient check in en out good breakfast nice lobby very clean friendly staff at one room service   aug the service was a little slow probably because it was sunday and i had no preserves the location of the hotel is the best almost all the staff are efficient i visited the restaurant once and the dinner was very good in quality i would expect different varieties on the breakfast and the lack was the reason i didn t choose a breakfast the stuff was very professional and welcoming the room was perfect in size clean and comfortable small room breakfast poor bedroom very small wanted an upgrade but the rate was changed to what was agreed by email breakfast was a very poor selection if you are not interested in a traditional fryno negative the hotel was located very near the hospital we needed to attend and the room was very pleasant and the decor modern and fresh the staff are very competent friendly and the concierges have excellent communication skills and are very helpful no negative this hotel is just fantastic a magnificent building spacious and luxurious rooms great park view the stuff was so helpful and polite everything we were looking for was there we would rate it as a five star hotel if you want peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you activity never ceases it is a very busy area the position of the hotel is excellent both for walkers and for the use of public transport staff are friendly and very helpful and the rooms are very clean and comfortable a little bit dark in the hotel and rooms our room is very spacious with a sitting room a bathroom is also spacious nice location close to russel square station our room   had shabby furniture well worn a job to get in and out of the bath needed another handle to get in i reported loos electric plug on electric iron the location the friendly staff in all departments made us feel at home as soon as we arrived multi national staff great team especially the irishman called bernad no negative beautiful high gothic hotel covered in marble just gorgeous and well sited for central london the british museum ucl soas and other places of interest good for living in squares booked a room with a view as read some poor reviews stating facing into a wall first room had a view but mould all round windows vile smell of damp only available other room faced into a court yard of airconditioning units the air con did not work properly in room and couldnt open windows because of all the noise from units outside was given a small electric fan and complementary bkfast as compensation but did not sleep due to heat lack of aircon and inability to open windows only one hour free wifi would not stay in this hotel again paid   for twin room very comfortable bed nice sheets good breakfast selection helpful staff tv reception was poor but you don t go to london to watch telly location the hotel was really gorgeous to look at giving the feel of luxury but at a for central london excellent price really nice staff restaurant menu did the obvious well enough all in all very happy and would not hesitate to book again the only complaint i would make is that the windows would not open and also the plumbing in the bathroom bowl was a bit sluggish the friendly helpful welcome on arrival the magnificent and beautiful interior the fact that all the long corridors still retained their original arches and chandeliers the fact that the bedrooms retained their original high ceilings windows and deep skirting boards the luxurious and very tastefully beautiful choice of carpeting in the corridors the smart uniform of the staff staff at reception were rude and are not welcoming at all on checkin the doorman was unfriendly it s quite ok to smile room was smaller than expected and the tv screen was tiny it also did not work lovely high ceilings in the room gorgeous location and clean checkout staff were very helpful and polite careful as the website images apart from exterior of the building look nothing like the actual hotel artistic licence being very creative my junior suite was reminiscent of bad student accommodation nothing   star about the  th floor i complained if i hadn t they would have left me to it stripped me if   i was moved to the  th floor because they knew exactly what i was talking about and they tried to charge me they saw the light when i shared my opinion of the hotel threatened to move hotel don t do it there are plenty of hotels that are more comfortable lovely better value for money in central london oh the wifi did not work location is great public spaces are impressive although in desperate need of refurb no negative friendly staff excellent location really worth the price for a superior double room on a july friday night in centre london asked for a room with a park view and they managed to arrange one although the police siren at night was a bit annoying but this was not a problem for us the room was a little small for a   star hotel and the price we paid and the bed was very uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved the location was great and staff very helpful staff seemed hard pressed and overworked felt like we were stuck away and multiple attempts still kept us from getting enough room for three to comfortably share one room promoting the location as being close to attractions that are over a mile away doesn t seem right the original building and its distinctiveness staff member was rude at desk after   nights stay when our key cards stopped working telling us we weren t doing it right after another member of staff came to our room to and apologised for other member of staff when realised it was the cards beautiful building rooms were lovely food was brilliant all round a great hotel room on this occassion was a bit small yoo much furniture in it step very near bed to bathroom could easily fall would req larger room next time bathroom is small bath very deep can b awkward to get in to beautiful historic hotel central location and very helpful staff rooms are comfortable and clean home from home feeling when we got to our room there was a a lovely complementary bottle of wine waiting for my mum and i such a lovely thought that is why i hope again to revisit this hotel again the outside of the hotel is far more majestic than its interior the staff extremely helpful the location extremely convenient if you want to have a quick access to heathrow airport quite disgusted to find the bathroom full of mold in a hotel ranked as a   stars hotel very friendly staff ideal location in a reasonable walking distance from main touristic sites we enjoyed free wi fi during our stay the air conditioner was like sleeping with a jumbo jet engine starting and stopping next to the bed could not sleep with it on in our daughters room the air conditioner did not work at all and the room was very hot the room also smelt badly staff changed their room the next day to an upgraded room at no extra cost the rest of the stay was comfortable the staff provided exceptional service the staff save this hotel none conveniently located close to bus and tube lines comfortable room with a modern bathroom and view of the square busy but relaxing public spaces with grand victorian lobby friendly and helpful staff we have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room   but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at  am by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into   which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis no positive i would never go backi have enjoyed better staff in   star hotels it is tired and needs quite a lot of money spent on it having said that the dining staff and food were very goodno positiveno negative great location nice area and near the tube station for piccadilly line beautiful and ornate building which stands out from the other hotels nearby we were celebrating my wife s birthday and the staff provided a great room wine and chocolates to welcome her good breakfast nice lounge bar no real facilities to mention such as gym or sauna but ideal for a weekend in london would definitely use again the room we stayed in was pretty small the decor very dated and it generally seemed a little shabby compared with the spectacular impression from outside the facade is spectacular and the location couldn t be better for sight seeing and shopping in london staff extremely friendly and helpful the fact that the air conditioning condensers are located in the middle of the hotel which means you hear a slight hum all night excellent service overall and the rooms were very comfortable no negative the russell square underground station was right around the corner this convenience allowed me to reach anywhere in the city within a few minutes staff are surly and unhelpful the hotel appears to be run for the convenience of the staff rather than the customers rooms are okay airco did not work in my room was therefore a bid warm taking into acount that outside temperature was also   degreesno positive the room is too dark we asked for extra light and it was provided immediately the breakfast and balcony of the room are really a big surprise shabby decor and ageing noise on street not dealt with by soundproofing as old sash windows don t do the job poor value for money no positive some construction work going on it was not noisy at all at night but a bit during the day really nice building and location view out of the window of big dirty aircon units loved the historic appeal and grand decor room was nice and bed was comfortable the first room we received was very poorly laid out the second room was excellent staff that eventually changed our room for a better one a c wouldn t turn on so the room was a bit hot but it was ok i was hardly there lovey staff very attentive shower only no bathtub no organization i e hooks or shelves in bathroom location was wonderful property was beautiful and staff was helpful hated the english style bath they need to upgrade to a walk in shower bar area and staff are good the hotel needs a proper restaurant long way from lobby to room and room was up a short flight of stairs after the long walk beautiful well appointed historic building the double bed against the wall so my partner found it very hard to get out of bed and the tv covered most of the window no positiveno negative great location and interesting to stay in a place designed by the same person who did the interior of the titanic sandwich from bar very poor sack after long day travelling room and bed comfy kept very clean overall our stay was very enjoyable nothing we are a couple in our   s and we were delighted with the cosy room comfy beds the breakfast was great the staff were wonderful showers were a bit old and was impossible to lower the shower temp as it always stayed at super hot temps staff were friendly and helpful our room wasn t ready when we got to our room and had to wait an hour for it to be cleaned staff friendly clean i booked for twin room but they mistook and couldn t provide a twin room so we were separated to a single room no positiveno negative we were sharing a twin room and got upgraded lovely big room with a balcony view over russell square gardens fab hotel drinks were quite expensive the bed was very comfy and when we arrived we got a few extras in our room as it was my boyfriends birthday the food in the restaurant was mediocre acceptable but not great the staff

short time i was able to enjoy dinner good rest and breakfast in my room small room very drab and dark limited plugs had to unplug the lamp to iron a shirt in the dark location is great for theatreland room comfy but a little noisy from i think the air conditioning unit did not have a view good location tube station near byno negative good location stayed here before some years ago great facility when only topping one night that you can leave bags and pick up later didn t sleep well due to extremely loud air conditioning units located below my room not ideal comfortable room and good wifi connection rooms at the front of the building can be noisy from the traffic on the main road below the staff were attentive and professional faulty bath and sink plugs could not drain water out this has happened before on a previous stay breakfast location staff all excellent no negative the staff was very friendly and helpful they changed our room immediately when we complained about the noise in our room none excellent location all facilities in the room are in good shape new liked the old fashion feel of the place very close to   tube stations standard room a bit small and in need of refurbishment also service charge on drinks in the bar friendly staff and a lovely old building the cost of the breakfast for a family of   was extortionate the location was ideal for us the hotel was full of character and very stylish the bathroom was very dated and in need of minor repair the view from our corner room window was fantastic best seen at night extra bed was the worst breakfast queue was really terrible it s easy to tell people to come at a specific time though you have to arrange it somehow parking is far away and hard to come back because of road diversions just the location and viewno negative around the corner from the london eye and used it for a trafalgar trip as the pickup for our tour was around the corner walked down to the borough market and took a river cruise to greenwich plent of eating spots close by as well over the bridge was westminster abbey parliament house and big ben and walked to trafalgar square as well also a laundry available which is very helpful i wish you had wheat free snacks you re always my hotel of choice you re staff are incredible and recently you ve been giving me wonderful upgrades i always recommend you and when work ask me if i have a preference of accommodation you re my first pick i ve been staying with you for years so thank you bit of a wait for a table at breakfast the staff were all excellent the reception staff especially they went out of their way to make the kids feel welcome housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at  am this is your alarm very frustrated they will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours terrible if we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room no respect on guests don t expect this housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner they won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley they won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than   days doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week no positiveno negative the location it was so close to the london eye and the rest of the popular attractions that it was easy for my wife to go with the kids while i attendend a course at the hotel the rooms were comfortable and fair enough space breakfast was an absolute disaster   minute wait for a table que to get brerakfast and then a que to get toast by which time your breakfast was cold if you got the toast first and qued for breakfast you toast would have been cold no tea or coffee offered for   mibns room was very well appointed and facilities were good large queues for breakfast room was very crammed booked a room for   adults and   children no space to go in with a pushchair not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us   minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant staff was very helpful restaurant offered great food excellent location walking distance to waterloo station and several landmarks no negative were staying in london for just one night and the location was perfect we paid around   for one night for a family suite and it was very well worth the money the room was spacious enough for a family because there is a sleeping sofa but when the sleeping sofa is unfolded the room door is blocked very small opening to enter the room locationno negative location was great easy walk to london eye and big ben as well as many other attractions in this area hotel staff were great very helpful breakfast buffet was very good food was very fresh and well presented and although very busy staff were very efficient to make sure every one was well looked after housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all once when i returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet also they won t give you enough set of towels even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort they never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday the most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you but only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need e g i have   full bottles of conditioners   full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream they don t provide you with basic needs like slippers cotton pads wools q tips but we saw it in their trolley not even refill teabags milk sugar rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard no positive expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant we went to starbucks around the corner for this location to city attractions the room was comfortable and quiet bathroom was clean and the hot water in the shower was plentiful the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better the location is the perks here it is walking distance to the london eye and everything near it it is also about a   minute walk away from the nearest tube station there are many little cafes nearby so overall it is really convenient no negative it was a great stay for me and my family everybody in the hotel was so helpful especially courtney at the reception desk everything in the hotel was excellent including breakfast when we go to london again we will definitely stay in this hotel no negative convenience location   mins walk to waterloo tube station   mins to london eye suggest to choose a room with outside view finally paid   per night to upgrade no negative location perfect staff we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the park plaza building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel it wasn t the staff at the park plaza westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the park plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back they were all smiley and happy to assist us on the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright the lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready it was a quick  min wait which was fine no greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the spectrum bar it was  h and the bar was definitely not busy the difference between our experience between the staff from both park plaza hotels was just really evident that i had to put it here room superior room we stayed for our anniversary we got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels we were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night the tv monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc the bedroom and bath were just the right size it was not small but not too big as well we didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right mini bar was stocked with the basics we liked that there were extra pillows for us to use bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean breakfast good old continental and english breakfast air con control in room did not work properly had to ask reception to turn it off as it was freezing despite turning it to   degrees room very small for a   night stay dispute at check out regarding bar bill all drinks paid for as taken but still had some charged to room no positive slow elevators lots of wait time breakfast downstairs not the same as mezzanine and not as good great staff comfortable quiet rooms breakfast upstairs was good two large bath towels no hand towels or washcloths sink in bathroom about a foot lower than normal no tub no lip on shower area a wet room with water everytwhere no window to outside electric went out at     am no air to our room temperature got to be extremely warm well over   degrees interior room so it was pitch black up all night staff very unpleasant and not accommodating no announcements or explanations made regarding blackout very scary to be in a high rise in a city that s had terrorist attacks high rise fires and have a full power outage with no announcements no assistance or emergency lighting provided manager would not refund night we left before stay was over the night manager was horrible we had a horrible stay nothing other than location satisfied the room was very much smaller than i anticipated it must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as i checked in i had expected to have a small living area and that was why i booked this particular hotel as i did not want a traditional hotel room i did not get that no positive we had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room i liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced   of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the   drinks not many cafes and food option nearby the location is fantastic about   minutes walk to the waterloo station and london eye the studio double room is made up of   smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette there are kitchenware and microwave for use one room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other suitable for family of   there is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done leaking shower electricity went out one night but we were compensated temperature in room hard to regulate plenty of room in the studio double comfy bed great location to westminster sights and right off the waterloo tube stop long delay to get into room even though i arrived after check in time room was dirty london eye view wasn t proper as blocked by other hotel shouldn t have to pay for the poor view nice breakfast and dinner avaliable very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved friendly staff good location the bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower secondly the beds are not comfortable enough the hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it the hotel location is great it is a walking distance to london eye westiminster bridge parliament square westminster abbey buckingham palace and many more the staffs are great and very responsive to request as a family of   with two young teenagers the room was a bit tight it was close to london eye and some other attractions as well as waterloo station room was clean and concierge ceasar was extremely helpful breakfast was good bath was too high to step into safely glass screen was loose unsecured not enough tea bags milk sugar when we phoned for more tea bags a handful of everything else other than tea bags was given to us breakfast was excellent gym was handy the sleeper couch which acts as the second bed was uncomfortable and not practical when open as it was in the way of the door location is great close to the underground and over ground stations close to super attractions was not that clean lot of things like cushion cover forgotten happened but staff was friendly ans fast breakfast queue close to eye and park good f r kids bit staff is very friendly and helpfull no negative staff extremely helpful and friendly room upgrade on arrival free of charge to a penthouse suite fantastic for us as was our first time away just the two of us in   years   min walk from waterloo station was indicated that room family friendly room was   queen and   sofa didn t realise second bed was a sofa bed sofa not comfortable at all for   children   plus sleeping together asked staff if a better bed room was possible which was not offered to try make sofa bed more comfortable but nothing was done location was good room size ok bathroom size ok seemed slightly shambolic i checked in around  pm and yet i was told i wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when i actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh i kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me bit gross the location is good milk in the room fridge off breakfast staff   days out of the   i had to ask for coffee no one checked me all other people couples were asked perhaps a singles thing otherwise all good staff friendly and helpful location brill friendly staff location since we booked studio room with   children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room very good breakfast and nice staff for service we would love to stay here again if there any chance the only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened not a problem with the aircon on but i like fresh air when i sleep the bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own the shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping i guess the staff were kind polite very helpful and you could have a joke with them too we received a room upgrade upon check in the room was fabulous the hotel was clean and well presented we loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend to others the view from our room breakfast was awesome staff were very friendly and extremely helpful the bar restaurant was very convenient and provided great service loved the food and drinks they had to offer the bedroom and shower was nice i enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at park plaza county hall next time i m in town in terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily the location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which i was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room i found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again i realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable the reception staff were really unhelpful and glum they never smiled almost any request was too much trouble in a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key these appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed a poor reflection of the brand and hotel great location and helpful porters and concierge staff i discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout upon checkout i was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings as of now now communication have been made nothing room had a few damaged bits here and there very clean though the bed was big but i found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours the other main issue was the lifts in busy times we waited   minutes as we had a baby buggy with us i had   gripe as i m quite ocd and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels i ordered from housekeeping twice once each day breakfast that was available no veggie full breakfast was very good with nice pastries staff were nice and sociable throughout the hotel small for a family of   a little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year not enough pillows house keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for  hours location of the property air conditioning was a problem we had to let them know twice before it was handled overall we very much loved our stay upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in the restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the roomno positive booking com has wrong room advertised for penthouse suite actual room very disappointing who is to blame here staff at reception not helpful about mix up house keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer  st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room after spending over   pounds for   nights not happy hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but i believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude location was great to be honest but after that it s all down hill the breakfast was not how i expected it also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming welcoming staff on the front desk very helpeful amazing location and view from bedroom i called the hotel to ask if i can pay the last night of our family stay by maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible when we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information great central location   min walk from london eye big ben waterloo station very clean hotel and great service there is nothing significant to dislike as a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids the kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs the view of london eye is great the staff is quite responsive to all needs this includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge they were very courteous and helpful to us the breakfast is very good too a lot of variety the hotel location is the best part very close to the waterloo station a number of trains to places outside of london originate terminate here couple of bus stops are also nearby westminster bridge london eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk the county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store the booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money it is a very good offer breakfast was a little busy hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue breakfast quality itself was excellent little extras made a big difference it was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable there were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved we were a towel short   evening   phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within   minutes the location is superb   minutes walk from waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the london eye the south bank a bridge walk to either westminster or soho we were on the  th floor we could have been in the country it was quiet no road or plane noise at all no negative loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna aurora spa services also great liked the good security on entering the property would go back again especially with families it s a family hotel so sometimes there are kids running around like it s a playground apart from that all good superb location and excellent roomno negative breakfast was just okay family suite was perfect pretty quiet even at night close to all major london attractions except greenwich shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine there was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast great stay superb location comfy beds good english breakfast friendly staff front desk cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice i was disappointed i emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted everyone was confused however we were told in the end we could upgrade for another     pound a night which annoyed me we did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things the two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying in the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it concierge was very good but depended who was on breakfast was ok but really really busy overrall i wouldnt stay again as i would rather be in the middle of the town we had to take a taxi to oxford st all the time the bed was a good size and the sofa bed was good good with nespresso machine and microwave we ended up with good big windows and a light room nothing not a thing my son and i loved it staff were exceptional i wish there were a higher rating friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect this hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to london we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful the kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc and milk and water on the fridge plenty of wardrobe and storage space bathroom shower in particular was excellent breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl   floors highly organised and efficient wifi was great easily able to stream netflix etc and there was a big screen tv with many apps and all the premium channels the digging outside the reseption but of course this will be finished i have been several times in london this is my best hotel stay close to everything they need to provide slippers the fridge needs to be bigger to give you an idea of its size it could only fit two     liter soda bottles the location can t be beaten the separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side could have been more child friendly there were kids in the group that were   and six no facilities for children to play or be entertained staff at breakfast were very good concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful good breakfast for the money small and very dark room room was comfortable but very small more intimate than private but clean and tidy shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night the bars were poking through the very thin mattress the amount of money paid for the accommodation i was expecting at least a comfortable bed everything else was terrific the location and cleanliness a  proximity excellent our first room was not to our liking we paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier we were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night he was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible however i found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay more than   gpb for   nights communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee booking com refunded me   gbp the difference in the price thank you booking com for keeping the promise i like the location that is close to london eye big ben and the themes i like the nice room size i did not like the bathtub with the shower the shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of the staff was extra helpful and friendly the breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted i also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be restaurant is dual purpose good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff breakfast very ordinary i am afraid food from the cooked options cold toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options eggs benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service complimentary upgrade to suite well received room absolutely perfect especially after long working day location is great for south bank and county hall exhibitions and conferences the sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room the layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room the location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk  min from the station not impressed with the service of the staff either no positive they purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready the reason i wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a  hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at  pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in i felt discriminated no positiveno negative the room was lovely small by american standards but to be expected in europe the beds were very comfy and the room has a coffee and refrigeration station plenty of storage for your clothing and bags perfect room for   people lovely hotel would stay here again location is superb it was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at     am as expected we had to wait until       am so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy only one point toilet paper holder doesn t work the roll keeps popping out the hotel staff were lovely and i loved the layout of the room also my mother called in to do something special for my birthday and the hotel staff were great about it big thank you to them disappointed by bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when i finally got attention and asked for half a lager i was told rather rudely that i d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free i waited for a few more minutes i had been walking in   degree heat and finally gave up comfy beds and sheets huge room with fridge and microwave two tellies very polite and helpful reception staff there was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this i would recommend asking for a room with a view i didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor the bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as i was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends we had a corner room on the  th floor with two large windows spectacular views of big ben palace of westminster the london eye and the city skyline over the waterloo train station this location is awesome to go to all the southbank attractions restaurants waterloo train underground station westminster bridge and longer walks along the thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after     pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of pimm s at the southbank centre almost every night the room was spacious especially for a hotel in london and the bed was large and comfy this is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat the staff were super friendly and very helpful we didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel tv didn t work poor lighting in room poor toilet roll fittings no dressing gown or slippers could have been cleaner room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms also room overlooked restaurant not up to   star rating shower difficult to operate nothing in particularno negative this is the first time i d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last from the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the italian restaurant i could find no faults everyone was very welcoming and friendly by london standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning the way we were checked in by mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at  am not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception bad night sleep no positive the traffic was a shambles outside the hotel this hotel was very nice a great location near westminster bridge for city access the breakfast was very good a bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after   weeks on the road the concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door there were no actual shops nearby i like to step out on the street and have things to look at we had to taxi to the main centre of london we didnt like our first room it was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light we had continual problems with the tv volume everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume that was annoying the buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible they refunded our meal though the room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room ideal location just a stones through from waterloo station clean rooms beautiful bathroom kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice two tv s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch tv comfortable bed too impersonal modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the london eye great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area clean and suitable rooms each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee sometimes we had to ask several times even then sometime we never receive it not impressive major construction in front of the hotel it was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply everything else was good the staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were great poor wifi all staff were nice except ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice the tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv i liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our   year old son stayed in the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view it wasn t worth spending the money the cleanliness of the whole location crowded reception and queues room   room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant bar staff were attentive and service great nothing location was excellent staff were super helpful and their italian restaurant a had extremely good good at reasonable prices extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children the double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other we couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat the airconditioner did not cope hot i don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot the view from our room was waterloo station the location was great close to major attractions and transport we enjoyed the breakfasts we heard very little noise from waterloo station despite our room overlooking it noisy until   am adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful amazing staff great customer service spacious clean and comfortable room cooked breakfast option was dreadful bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits scrambled eggs tasted disgusting beans were only warm stuck to the much nicer fresh option triple room flooded as soon as shower went on spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill plenty of selection at breakfast attentive staff too many issues to get sorted with the room bath plug not working no remote for the t v piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more there were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places comfortable bed and a good sized room able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus water and sweets were left for us on arrival staff dealt with problems with the room quickly could to see part of the london eye and big ben from the window so we enjoyed the view laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay a bit of construction around the area very close to london eye and across the bridge from big ben and westminster abbey a small supermarket nearby and starbucks close to waterloo station room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my pjs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall great room with large size flat screen tv that had you tube videos and tv excellent staff and consierge service would come back here again to stay although i wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel i never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival the breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around  am be prepared to wait some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once but overall nothing major and the good intention is there last thing we were unlucky i guess our room for   was on the  nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and wifi was fairly weak in or room superb location starting with london eye and westminster abbey big ben and some more within short walking distance public transportation and train stops also very close ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation i guess staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting magda on reception our cleaning lady nadia and one member i think sarah at the breakfast would have appreciated a late check out say     pm for freshen up prior to train journey staff were friendly and very helpful very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out not enough shower gel body lotion etc also i had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room location good value restaurant excellent staff no negative the location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river the room was on the  th floor so had amazing views of the london eye comfortable bed overlooking the views of london not for business travelers i requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening nice breakfast good kitchen staff strange layout with toilet in the middle of room with kitchen part and with sliding door didn t have much privacy breakfast area over crowded and difficult to move around does not seem big enough for size of hotel and food not really fitting of the rest of the hotel room size was good and quiet and always cleaned all in all a great hotel perfect location near westminster bridge waterloo mainline and tube stations and   minutes to south bank promenade and the london eye close to all sights and facilities we stayed for   nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the shard also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave clean comfortable and great for an extended stay great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers on site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful with information and very welcoming i liked everything the view of the london eye was amazing especially at night the bed was so comfortable with a puffy duvet and quality linens breakfast included had a huge buffet with custom omelets the hotel like many central london hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes we found one online at upper marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened there are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options westminster southbank and london eye all nearby from reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating this is a really good hotel and great for family visits ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat the reservation and reception teams thanks to courtney michaela and i think sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups the children also enjoyed the glass lift reception staff were absolutely wonderful alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out this is the second time we have stayed at park plaza county hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return the room was a bit tired and the tea coffee facilities weren t replenished i had to ring up and ask it was delt with quickly upon the phone call loved the view and the space excellent location very close to the london eye and the waterloo train station unfortunately this   floor hotel has   very slow elevators once it took me   minutes to reach my room at the  th floor from the reception with the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experienceno positive house keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate the bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the london eye with an early check in bed a little hard and noise from the lift outside rooms were great with lots of space to put clothes away and good cupboard in bathroom good coffee facilities and fridge to put own drink couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult staff were great and went the extra mile receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have   rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems staff in the bar at lunchtime were lovely and the food was very good i had to make an emergency phone call to australia and my phone wasn t charging i asked staff they said of course i didn t think to ask of cost they charged me   pound for a   minute call disgusting on the whole it was excellent n a the staff so so friendly and accomodating they went above and beyond to find room in the freezer for medications and the concierge helped us on a daily basis no negative all the staff were really friendly and helpful our family room was very spacious and comfortable with a great view breakfast was delicious with a good choice absolutely fabulous location for exploring london breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful no toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children room size was good and kitchen facilities were a great addition for drinks etc great view over london towards the shard and steps from the attractions on the embankment no negative location was perfect short walk from westminster great small restaurants and grocery shops nearby this place was a lifesaver after a dodgy previous hotel and they gave us a free upgrade bed was hard and squishy room   tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful helpful staff and dining staff clean and neat nice breakfast where was the real butter the hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn had a great time in london we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the thames or an open bus trip the underground and train station are close too we did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces the weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day after each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening hopefully will visit again soon as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school room had no window it is noisy with staff talking outside the door i feel ripped off everything was great i thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident great hotel would stay again the only odd thing was was seats in the bar area were really old tatty and uncomftable which was really odd as everything else was great service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really on arrival room wasn t ready so they swapped our room and gave all   of us a complimentary drink excellent location to explore london parking was not with hotel but around corner   for   hours looks rough but perfectly good service l italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant i only added a little request in my booking about it being my mums birthday we were overwhelmed with the view the balloons the wine and the card it was one of the best trips to london ever thank you you made my mother s birthday hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com they will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad pillows smells like french fries but bed was so comfortable no body answeing phone so i have to come down for any request i requested city view and i was promised to get it if available but when i reach i discovered that all twin room has inside view which i hoped if they told me before excellent location clean rooms cooperative staff we pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing excellent location housekeeping was very quick to respond and deliver our requests the night concierge was especially terrific considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside great staff esp mariana receptionist good breakfast and location we were allocated in a very small dark twin room for the first night and asked for a room change next day the new room was comfortable with natural light the fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well we had to use some of the towels to dry the floor also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about   to see if they could get in to clean the room checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and i view from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms this was a shame as being on the  th floor it would have been nice to have an external window location was ideal for what we were doing in london thames cruise london dungeons and sea life centre couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance can extend late check out up till  pm by paying   pounds per hour we were   families and had   rooms one of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used the staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room they kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day they just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower they used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay the hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care the hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations they must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required the only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night no positive construction near hotel makes it difficult for taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult not a fault of the hotel though i had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room hotel did not force situation forced me but the upgrade view was good with london eye big ben westminster abbey all visible from the room window excellent location with many major attractions like london eye big ben parliment houses all at walkable distances we wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken the room we had was for   people and it was like a mini apartment with a double bedroom small kitchen area and then the sofa bed set up in the lounge great value between the   of us the location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way betterno positive lots of road works going on having to pay for the internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location in the center of london no negative staff were so helpful to make the night before and morning of my wedding lovely and stress free from providing a special room with a view to assisting with deliveries of flowers etc everything was great the suite with london eye view was wonderful thanks to all staff particularly concierge the bed was uncomfortable the tv was tucked in the corner of the room front desk staff was unpleasant the front desk staff was unfriendly we got a room facing all the construction asked for a room not facing the street construction not sure if the lady at the front desk was having a bad day but she gave a tiny room where the tv was tucked in a corner so only one side of th room could see the tv the bed was horribly uncomfortable a significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly a proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom location and views great studio itself was lovely with good amenities soundproofing of the windows was also good room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel no view therefore needed better lighting within restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast location was good and within easy walking distance of transport restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful it might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance this didn t affect me as i was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise the hotel was lovely staff were friendly and helpful i had an amazing room with a sitting area and kitchenette plus large bathroom with bath and shower plus i was happy to have been allocated a quiet room brilliant location about   minute walk from waterloo station i found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable english were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant they were however always polite and helpful being upgraded to a suite it made the hotel visit so much more enjoyable the staff in the dining room were most helpful friendly and welcoming house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the  th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top   floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant gym was well equipped penthouse was spacious and well designed we were there from friday afternoon until sunday and our room was not cleaned on the saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels everything was perfect especially the italian restaurant where the food was outstanding everyone were extremely nice and helpful and i mean everyone hotel italian restaurand had automatic     tip added small print bottom of receipt and i also left   for   meal so they got   for delivering   main courses failed to mention when i gave extra money disappointing   min max walk from waterloo got bus back to victoria station for airport transfer outside door had a sick family member and got checking in early and option to upgrade which we gladly accepted for   per night extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep room was too hot air con was not working as it should convenient location dealt with above excellent location for the london eye royal festival hall and south bank staff were very helpful as we had a slight incident with our first room and rectified the situation effectively upgraded us our junior suite had a lovely view over county hall and the london eye and was very clean the only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for the warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat the whole surroundings of the hotel and in particular the rooms were superbly furnished and catered for the view over the city was outstanding and the location you literally couldn t hand pick a better spot to explore everything in london the room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep if squeaked so much no positive the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low location of hotel was perfect the staff where very helfull and tended to our ever need food in the bar could have been improved i would have liked more choices for breakfast agtha in the breakfast room was extremely nice friendly always had a smile on her face so helpful she impressed us the most the bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour the excellent dinner in the restaurant the drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in london anyway we upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view staff were really helpful and the location is amazing it s only a   minute stroll to the london eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best very children focussed welcome pack on arrival vouchers for icecream and drinks at bar the promised sauna steam room were not working i phoned the reception they said they were but when i went down they weren t and i wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly they also didn t respond to my complaint about it very disappointing they upgraded my room unrequested and free of charge which i appreciated we had a drink in the outside veranda at around     at     the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance upgraded a standard room to a mini suite for just     the biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift good location with good size rooms more space between the door and the bed but that was a very minor issue road works made walking a bit roundabout but nothing to do with the hotel the bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious we arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early the hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to waterloo or westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time we have stayed here before and would definitely stay again see above my room was excellent in all respects especially the bed tv bath etc i checked in at  p and i had not realised that my internet booking did not include breakfast and i had to leave the hotel by    am in the morning a saturday breakfast room was opening later than usual as it was a saturday so no breakfast for this   year old at the price i paid for the one night   a hot something should have been quickly prepared for me or open the kitchen for a quick sustaining breakfast eg eggs or porridge etc or given me a packed breakfast the bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion the room was nice and clean and fully equipped with the essential equipment needed while traveling e g ironing microwave hair dryer etc the hotel is close to london eye big bin     minutes walking and around     minutes away from hyde park and oxford street where all the well known shopping shops are breakfast was fine and the food is delicious i felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that i mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me food was excellent staff were extremely professional and polite smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children location quiet room room was a little small and the room window looked at the inside of the hotel the pillows were lovely and soft and the cleaner was very good at her job there wasn t anything we did not like this was our  rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed fantastic nights sleep bed was so comfy loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky couple of sidelights in room did not work shower controls a bit of a mystery convenience to south bank attractions and old vic theatre stayed   days with my family for the london marathon not a good experience the hotel is always crowded and not relaxing rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed in the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed satellite tv always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions the first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators the queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that i was with my parents who had to wait   mins standing before sitting inaccurate room cleaning one day room was made at     the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap the next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes the first day they started to knock at the door for service at   in the morning with people still in the room breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions location near waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street to find some bars overall this hotel was a terrible choice no positive we booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him we paid a lot to stay there and brought another   couples with us and i just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and i would think twice about dining there again other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful fab location lovely rooms most of the staff were very helpful would definitely stay again i did not like breakfast at all except the omletes cooked by chief restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant location was perfect room service was really good rooms were clean and tidy all the time not happy with the service in the italian resteraunt very slow automatic service charge added even though it took over   hours for   course meal of which the one of the courses was a cold starter people that were seated after us were served preferentiallyno positive the room is a bit dated the fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked great location with close proximity to a number of tube stations the double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room given the price this was not worth it the breakfast was nice but cost additional   pounds per person also requested a   hour late check out and was charged an additional   pounds per room seemed unnecessary staff was very accommodating in particular a concierge named gerry he was pleasant kind and generous even loaned his phone adapter to my son we had two rooms upgraded one to a suite which gave us more room and was a big upgrade to a superior room location was great for the london eye and numerous restaurants in the area at peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly the hotel is in a great location with close proximity to waterloo station it was very easy to get to the hotel from heathrow airport via the heathrow express and bakerloo line from paddington station the staff was very friendly and helpful for a hotel room in europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four we also had a great view of the london eye from the  th floor the children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their park plaza euros at the bar i would highly recommend this hotel i wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the london congestion charge is prohibitive the breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good extremely friendly and helpful staff good location for tourists who can walk to many attractions a happy and vibey place to stay room cleaning could be improved cables of open lifts causes steady noise clack clack that disturbs at night in some room after a roomchange it was okay upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing no external view as requested even though i know not guaranteed our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view i would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view a nice few days spent in london however would not stay at this hotel again good location to waterloo station very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead took   attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a   year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size overall i d highly recommend this hotel especially for those coming into waterloo with a young family fab upgrade to a penthouse fantastic views and very kind and helpful front desk staff children made very welcome no negative upgraded to a studio for   per night great view over the city excellent location for westminster the west end and waterloo station   minutes for a great walk along the embankment into the city of london could hear people walking about the floor comfty rooms and big as we was on penthouse floor we had stunning view of london eye and big ben would come bk room i booked was small and dark with no outside window in my opinion it was misrepresented on booking com we would not have been happy there for   days upgraded room fabulous view excellent service great location have stayed previously and room was excellent this time it was far too hot even after the maintenance had attended had to keep curtains closed as air con couldn t keep the room at normal temp friendly staff nice restaurant breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars view from the site was excellent location to attractions was first class it took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning good location near the key attractions for the family london eye shrek adventure etc the italian restaurant was very good excellent margarita pizza and cheese cake air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot room service meal only warm breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold room was ok and ready early had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head this was poor both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however had to alert reception that i was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast this was poor the service reception concierge room service maintenance housekeeping overall was good efficient and friendly used room service three times the service and food was of a consistently good standard i purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast we ate there twice and it was fine but i was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something i had paid for loved the proximity to transportation and activities strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station poor breakfast service queuing for   minutes before gettting a table in a conference room being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast poor quality of food especially bread we had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set no positive please clean the windows since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them the breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine the location the feeling of welcome the staff gave us they were very helpful the family room was very roomy and comfortably its was very good for us to have a laundry room standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me     service charge serving me a beer over the bar location and price for family room was main attraction warmer welcome would ve been better appreciate   tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend but think my money is as good as anyone elses breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long plaza opposite westminster bridge much better nice clean hotel comfortable bed the breakfast buffet area was too small we were disappointed about no pool the beds were very comfortable the rooms were lovely the staff were pleasant the elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about   min for a table the room was nice overall the stay at park plaza county hall met my expectations the only inconvenience was the lifts it felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor the room was small but clean and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was very good with traditional english breakfast food the hotel was conveniently located near waterloo train station westminster via a short walk over westminster bridge as well as the london eye and numerous restaurants coffee shops and pubs the gym facilities were very nice with the added bonus of a sauna and steam room the concierge and bell man services were very helpful and professional parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors really nice helpful staff perfect location family room good for up to family of   room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs location of hotel is fantastic particularly small kids who don t want to spend too much time walking we had a great weekend break one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation very good resturant close to london eye and big ben very comfort with smart tvno negative receptionist from italy sorry i forgot her name she s very nice to us saying welcome to london and to the property she also upgraded our room with a fantastic view of the big ben and londoneye during our   nights stay restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria bar area unexciting too felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either room gave you privacy whilst accommodating a family and the location with the easy access to waterloo and the river the view from the room was great city view through waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time comfy room and bed very helpful staff good breakfast near to waterloo tube bus trains near to westminster bridge and london eyeno negative stay was wonderful staffs were friendly enjoyed the yummy breakfast especially the scrambled eggs loved the room and we got upgraded to a bigger room would definitely come back breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay location and views from the rooms we had were good the breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel when we checked in we were given a complimentary upgrade to our room and it was amazing the staff were friendly welcoming and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them the breakfast is so basic for its price the food assortment is very limited for the price of   pounds i can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe i also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table good location and big room number you also have the little kitchen in the room there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the tv is located in one side and it hard to watch tv from the other bed side location of the hotel is very good and the kids gift is a nice idea specially the park plaza money room   and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner impossible not to like this hotel great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in we also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices the staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail we were initially booked into room   which faces onto the westminster plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them to be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms we decided on a junior suite room   which looked out on big ben county hall and the eye it did cost   more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive we were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us we didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at     am the hotel was in an excellent location   mins walk to london eye and westminster bridge the staff were very helpful we even received an upgraded room as our allotted room was not ready everything was just as i expected from a large chain hotel the room was clean and well stocked and the shower in the bathroom was amazing wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly wifi poor speed housekeeping excellent two tvs good thinking rooms were sometimes not made during the day restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast location makes this a clear choice was easy to get to and close to the attractions and inner city this room was not worth   night i believe that the premier inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities the amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room the wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for   room guests the bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force in this case it could result in that person sustaining injury i would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom no positive room cleaning was great when they did it but there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet not a big deal but worth mentioning breakfast was definitely one of the best parts of this hotel to be able to get up in the morning with two kids and have a full breakfast made was invaluable my kids could not get enough of agatha one of the breakfast hosts she was fantastic which made the mornings a breeze no negative location is the best of all  min walk to westminster bridge super helpful staff proper modern star hotel better value than the park plaza hotel opposite to it breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the   mornings location room was lovely and staff were very nice hotel was clean and restaurant had reasonably priced menu security was good too as they asked for room card at night overall it is s lovely hotel and would recommend to friends and family visiting london some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking we had a complimentary upgrade to a penthouse room which was lovely having said that i always find the rooms very clean and quiet the cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location i ll make an exception the noise of people opening and closing doors was immense also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud it was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet the sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least lack of usb chargers in a modern hotel is questionable the location was perfect the hotel was clean and modern looking the staff was friendly the fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading i did not like this at all the temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off i asked to move room and turned out i couldnt as none of them have windows not good the little kitchen in the room reception for my mobile phone the room was exceedingly comfortable very very clean much better than some london   star rooms very impressed one tiny problem was i had zero connection to my phone breakfast was excellent price very good i will definitely stay again as the hotel is perfectly situated for the heart of london a picture is worth a thousand words added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central london and what you see through your window if you can after paying about  euros per night in a   star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at     am in the working days sure they do have double glazed glasses but i am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation seems no one reads or cares what is written there in the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed after all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary we will never step in park plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and i will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them the best thing was the location of the hotel we had an internal view quite disconcerting would have requested to change it had we stayed longer fantastic central location came into waterloo and walked from the hotel everywhere we arrived early but were still able to check in which was a bonus and facilitated changing shoes and using the bathroom good breakfast it was very very pricey to stay here the breakfast on day   had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast the location is great and the property is modern clean and comfortable the italian restaurant was fantastic and the wait staff was very attentive the breakfasts were plentiful and delicious the bar at night stayed open late and we had a great time i wish the staff could speak better english i found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster i m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc a small thing but annoying it is really well located and a very nice hotel the facilities are good and bed comfortable and the room pretty quiet for london the restaurant and food were excellent and pretty good value as a lone traveller i felt very safe and comfortable there because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next it would have been really great if they had offered french toast pancakes or waffles sigh but that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have and the food was fresh and hot with plenty available we stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful great stay overall i would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as waterloo station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go the room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel the waterloo station  min walking from the hotel the hotel doesn t provide room dining   hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant the room was clean the staff were very friendly the laundry service was good but expensive the rooms was not big enough for   or   persons we asked for   beds but did only get   bed and   crap sofa the wc dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy no positive hard to find anything wrong my single room was tiny but this is normal for central london very high levels of service met at check in with a hot towel and a fruit drink and had my bags carried to my room super friendly and polite staff good value at   actually cheaper than the nearest premier inn that night hd tv was confusing and i am not convinced was working properly that is itv  continually showed a sky trailer i could not get any itv  programs tv guide was also not working room layout was highly original and excellent breakfast the shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the  nd evening of our   night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon the room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the   occasions we complained about the shower we were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted this was never done i was also given a discount card and told i could use this for a   discount on the hotel bar and restaurants when i purchased a rum and ginger at the bar i was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full     for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly   the location was good for access to attractions and central london all in walking distance nothing great service friendly staff and perfect location we were lucky enough to have the room upgraded and so it simply could t have been better   frontdesk is soso i asked for an adampter wehn i checked in and was told i have to come tomorrow morning    am when i came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any so i have to buy one in b  suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well   the price is higher compared with its service the location is excellent     minutes walk to waterloo station and can walk to many famous places such as big ben london eye hyde park buckingham palace britis museum etc the underground waterloo is very busy between         am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can we arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location she just did not care at all but this is the case in all london hotels i ve noticed specially with the east european staff members their accent showed through the sighing especially so rude spending   a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted as a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying location was great but hidden behind their big brother from the same chain the restaurant served excellent food for reasonable prices the reception gave us discount coupons and upon their recomm we ate their room were soundproof so we could have all the piece to study for an exam big ben at walking distance great view from the hotel our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day not very comfortable and not good value no positive i requested a higher floor room but assigned a  st floor room in the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock the bed was terribly hard and i had a backache next day locationno negative if you are looking for sightseeing this is the place to stay as everything is close to this hotel the couch became a double bed while we had a king size double bed as well when we walked in everyone was open and started complimenting me and my friends the airconditioner was warm and i found out just on the last night when i asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff it would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your cc is needed in advance if u want to order room service should be part of the initial cc pre authorization i shouldn t be paying each time i order something nice touristic location close to wesminister and big ben walking distance to london eye and many attractions waterloo station is a   min walk and is serviced by a good bus network there is also a starbucks for coffee lovers   minutes away not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position position is hard to beat slap bang in the middle of the city a  min walk to the london eye really good place no negative both the food and the location were wonderful the staff was very helpful and quick to comply all of our requests we ll definitely be coming back again the burger was a bit scary other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok i requested a late check out the night we checked in the receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of  pnds an hour i called in the morning at  am to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room after that there were   phone calls through out the morning up until     a little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience   hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible the room was great and had a view of the train station a beautiful night view we had a great tapas platter in the bar doormen where excellent checkin was fast and easy i requested a late check out the night we checked in the receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of  pnds an hour i called in the morning at  am to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room after that there were   phone calls through out the morning up until     a little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience   hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible nothing couldn t find fault with anything didn t like not having time to use the spa front of house staff efficient and friendly room clean spacious and light microwave was great for heating a snack etc no negative the room suited my children perfectly and made sure we had a relaxing night sleep staff were so welcoming to us all especially my children my son was greeted with birthday gifts in our room which he was over the moon about can t rate this hotel highly enough there is nothing i didn t like you would have to be a very miserable person to complain about park plaza county hall the hotel is lovely as well are the staff nothing was to much trouble and we were even upgraded to a studio which was great surprise can t wait to stay again when we re next in london had to wait   hours for our room ordered delivery and had to go downstairs in my pajamas to get it the shower water overflowed into the kitchenette area and then all the way into the bedroom our entire room was soaked the room was freezing the entire time despite the heat being on the maximum level no positive the sofa bed was hard the pillows were far to soft and useless as when you put your head on them they disappeared and gave no support bring your own room far to stuffy and hot air con made it hotter if stayed longer would have complained about heat room layout and size was really good location was perfect children s sofa bed was very uncomfortable frosted glass bathroom door didn t afford much privacy loved the small kitchenette with fridge and microwave ideal for families no milk in room for drinks shower unable to regulate temperature although i asked for twin as i stayed with my son the   beds were positioned too close like a double bed much too tired to complain that evening as we were late checking in and just wanted to sleep breakfast not included i booked reservation fee days before arriving date after i checked in i found the price was dropped a lot however booking still charged me the original price i booked i hope booking is able to alert customer wht the recent price is the location is perfect i had to wait for my room to be ready even though i d arrived late afternoon and also i had to wait for a table at breakfast perfectly adequate facilities for one night and the concierge guys were great n a we were upgraded our room was excellent and although overlooked waterloo station was very quiet and we had a view of the shard very pleased indeed didn t like coming home because had a great time liked hotel staff location room cleanliness view and the general simplicity and helpful support you need when travelling as a family valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business uk needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times concierge absolutely helpful excellent customer service a solid door on the in room bathroom instead of a sliding frosted glass door had to pay for wifi hotel was close to the london eye westminster bridge parliament building big ben clock tower when i booked i requested a room on a high floor with good view we got a room overlooking a building site the hotel said you had not forwarded this request i was very disappointed as i had booked last year felt let down the bed was comfy and facilities good nothing customer service was outstanding it was my friend s birthday and we got a free upgrade to a room with a view of the london eye and a complimentary bottle of wine pillows far too soft didn t sleep too well a nasty smell of stagnant water in the bathroom the location was perfect the bar area was nice but it took   minutes for someone to take our drinks order nothing overall an amazing hotel a beautifully presented hotel set in an amazing location two minute walk from the best attractions in london staff were very friendly and the rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfy room was a bit small for   adults and   children not much room to move around in my husband requested a special children s pack for my daughters birthday which included ice cream and it arrived much later and all melted left in our room also when they removed it and we requested another one it took almost an hour i had also informed the hotel it was my daughters birthday but nothing special was done about this if it wasn t for my husband paying extra for the kids package we could have been at any hotel breakfast was good my daughter also really enjoyed it room was clean no complaints breakfast was excellent with very good service rooms were excellent vary spacious and great we had interconnecting doors as we requested for which your excellent staff opened up and also made the sofabeds up in both our bedrooms rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism i relocated wifi throughput erratic tv cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took   days to fix this spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on for   per night i would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments good location spectacular views bus literally in front of the hotel backs onto waterloo station superior rooms are very spacious good hardware like huge tv flexible and helpful staff beautiful materials rooms too hot at night ambient temperature too high and felt putting air conditioning on in march a waste of money and not very environmentally friendly being upgraded to a suite very helpful as we had two small children much appreciated no negative hotel is in an ideal location for visiting all london s sights in vicinity of the south bank and london eye all staff were very pleasant and helpful the room was excellent and very comfortable would happily recommend the hotel to friends and family the walk in shower was not well designed water went everywhere every time you had a shower however it wasn t a major problem excellent location for the west end and for visiting the imperial war museum central located hotel close to amenities public transport and various forms of entertainment the staff were professional and friendly the hotel is located close to many amenities the room was clean and comfortable the staff was very amenable and agreeable to us checking in a bit earlier and checking out a bit later which enhanced our stay scary open elevator the room was very clean as was the bathroom the bathroom has a separate shower with   shower heads and a bathtub big welcome on the flatscreen the room has a big glass wall and being on the  th floor the view was nice at breakfast coffee tee gets served at the table and staff was attentive enough to fill my waterflask with cold water the free internet connection was good above average video call and streaming tv was good no lag no negative i would not normally mark somewhere   out of   but as soon as we got there the staff were friendly and helpful the room was excellent there was a nice seating area outside where the wife could have a smoke while we had a drink when we went out in the evening there was a good selection of bars and restaurants within a short walking distance in the morning there was a good selection for breakfast we both had a full english breakfast which was cooked to perfection the bathroom had a frosted glass door with no lock which may be off putting for some people we were given an upgrade to a family room so had a sofa bed and kitchenette as well as our double room the kitchenette was well stocked with crockery and cutlery a microwave and nespresso machine as well as a kettle and small mini bar fridge the room was on the  th floor and was very quiet with amazing views across the city we thought breakfast was expensive so didn t breakfast in the hotel nothing amazing service staff rooms and facilities the bed was incredibly comfortable we stayed in a superior double room and when i woke up i forgot my partner was in the bed next to me as it was so big amazing i thought breakfast was a little too expensive my only dislike warm welcome as soon as you enter staff are friendly and helpful was offered an upgrade before we traveled via email but was ok with what we had chosen the room had a view of the shard and the view was beautiful at night time we didn t have breakfast at the hotel we took breakfast with us there is a microwave and a fridge brilliant location for big ben and the london eye and is a five minute walk from waterloo train station cant wait to return bed was not ok bad comfort bad sleep tired during stay airco was not good way to hot in the room staff member treatened my girlfriend as a prisoner because she did not had the room card with her location is top that s it the bed was very low which if you are over   foot tall was disconcerting the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly but still professional and well run refreshing for a city centre hotel i still feel the cost for the hotel was expensive and we will not use it again the location for my business purposes was fine the hotel is ok for london pricing nothing we got a very nice room the receptionist giulia was very helpful and friendly the housekeeping was very good and friendly i very much appreciate the coffee and tea kitchen in the room every morning especially our last morning the house keeping would call very early to clan the rooms and wake us up on our last day they knocked at     amno positiveno negative wonderful welcome from michaela who was excellent very friendly and helpful also upgraded us breakfast was also excellent with great selection and service highly recommend to all   bath room is not cleaned after room cleaning a lot of hair can be still found in the sink   every evening after whole day visit find the room card doesn t work each time i have to go down to the reception for validation even i have paid all my stay   we live in the family room but they only give bathgel and shampoo for max   persons every evening i have to call for extra for rest of the family location is great the breakfast was lovely with plenty of option just the scrambled egg was nasty very rubbery and bland the upgrade and welcoming members of staff who greated and treated us to an upgrade on arrival as it was a special occasion for us really did make our stay at the park plaza enjoyable and a happy memory thankyou wasn t happy with the main shower head not working properly coming out at different angles and water ended up on the ceiling and the floor making it very dangerous to walk onno positive the sofa bed was not that clean so i phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice i waited for the lift for around   mins   lifts are not enough nice reception staff wide room excelent location good restaurant closed to private car park shower bath water was cold called reception several times and nothing was sorted came in on saturday night and the staff on reception was so close with each other flirting and touching each other made me feel so uncomfortable the room wasn t cleaned even though we left the sign on the door i feel disappointed with the stay when paying so much money i would like to be able to be in contact with manager as i would like a refund the view from the room was brilliant breakfast was not included and really should had been for the price i paid nice comfortable room and very great location lovely food in the restaurant italia very good standard when we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny the penthouse fantastic views carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes the room was internal and the only window faced onto the restaurant so there was no natural light not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen but for only   nights it was perfectly liveable staff were excellent mentioned on booking that we were there to celebrate my mother s  th birthday and the staff upgraded her room put a bottle of wine and a card and wrote a birthday message on the window my mother was delighted and this is the kind of thing that customer service is all about going the extra all of the staff we came across were helpful friendly and knowledgeable special thanks to elizabetta on reception and marta in the bar they re the only names i remember and i hope i got them right room was a very good size plenty of facilities provided including a microwave and crockery just need reception staff to work on their grasp of understanding the customer it took a few attempts to make myself clear staff mostly from oversees were very engaging and accommodating i liked how efficient and organised the staff were in queuing and sitting people for breakfast it was a perfect example of everyone knowing what they were doing i liked the housekeeping service they followed instruction well and appropriately and were discreet and accommodating reception staff were warm the room was to hot and the air conditioning system would not respond to the settings as it was only one night we put up with it but had our stay been longer we would have had to complain size of the room and the breakfast was really good i made a book at booking for two adult and one   year old when coming to the hotel i had to pay extra for the child not ok the location is just great with waterloo station close to the hotel london eye   min walk hotel and staff great lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs   for   hours which might put off some people travelling to london was stressful as i had never driven into london before however it was not as difficult as i had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of   however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport the hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience i would recommend the last floor  th the views were fantastic from the balcony the staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a   minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive i can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good the sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip the london eye parliarment big ben london dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone lack of extra pillows our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant we waited   minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed   times when we returned to our room about  pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which i thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them i requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped i wouldn t stop here again for money we paid the bed was really comfy the location was great nothing it was all good the staff were very welcoming and helpful the room was great it was very comfortable and clean the restaurant was excellent and we throughly enjoyed out meal there the location is fantastic for seeing a large area of central london by foot but is equally great for access to the tube at westminster first room wasn t ready came into a dirty room and the beds had no sheets staff are amazing had an issue with my room and they fixed it straight away was given another room the room did show some wear and tear e g loose tiles on the bathroom floor very good location quite modern hotel spacious room with separate bed compartment everything was fine always enjoy staying here i was upgraded to pretty much a suite nice touch when you re staying the one night spoilt now though as i ll always want that room d appalling breakfast organisation poor quality food items staff couldn t care less when complained at time curtains hanging off end of rail bathroom wiped clean but encrusted deposits around fitments there was more but they re not worth my timeno positive service completely incompetent unhelpful only room service staff knew what to do the rooms were dirty the amount of dust in the wardrobe was shocking i have never seen something like that in ta room which costs   a night in central london location i was in room   i think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every     minutes but shabby to be honest i don t like gun s i am comparing your hotel to the park plaza victoria in amsterdam that hotel is top banana it s a nice hotel would have liked a table and a second chair in the room because the settee was used as a bed for our stay we hadn t enough furniture to relax on executive studio had a great view comfy bed great bathroom tea coffee facilities excellent no street noise on  th floor very clean great location for a base not luxurious but practically perfect really sofa bed uncomfortable for children short wait for a table at breakfast staff fantastic couldn t do enough for us moved rooms due to an issue without any complaint breakfast good and fresh fruit available buffet style but all seemed to be cooked fresh queue for breakfast although it was only   mins it s hard with young children family suite was lovely loved the bathroom elegise toiletries little kitchen very comfy main bed although the sofa bed def for children not adults fab view of the eye too amazing staff so friendly especially raphael in the bar the gym equipment was ok but not as high standard as the rest of the hotel however it had a gym which is unusual for a london hotel in this price range giulia who checked me in very helpful as were all the other staff the room was outstanding and had lots of extra equipment like a microwave and coffee machine everything else i booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week the stay was for myself and my parents i havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before i get married firstly booking com has advertised the room i was booking with a picture of the room with a view to london eye or big ben did we get that view not at all and we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door my mom is disabled so i went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect so they changed our room to a junior suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station i have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to big ben or london eye which they said is not their fault and theres the shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the shard is in the city this is the city view you can say that pretty much about anything i appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until i realised that the spa bookings i have made for myself and my mother have not been made complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay there were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof i have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes the next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again i have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life the location is good but you would expect that for this sort of money anyway we are a family of   on arrival first day complementary toiletries not enough had to call house keeping for more second day was out most of the day sight seeing got back at     room just cleaned left us with   towels only no toiletries had to ring house keeping again the room was spacious and very comfortable the choice for the breakfast was amazing found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed unfortunately they didn t sleep very well we had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel lovely clean room fantastic location which is why we book here very good for the tube clipper to reach all the attractions london has to offer usually had a great experience but didn t match previous visits here this one was our third no negative we had an excellent stay at park plaza county hall reception and concierge staff were very polite and helpful we will definately try to stay here on our next break in london the fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you i found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that i paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so i paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund i liked the friendly staff warm welcome and beautiful clean rooms the key cards weren t that great found ourself standing there for ages to try and get in to our room also the room was very hot even with the aircon on lowest temp so didn t sleep that great the hotel room was beautiful nice and clean and felt homely staff were friendly and was easily laid out so could find everything wish we had more time to get the full use of what they had to offer because it sounded amazing breakfast area often overcrowded room requires some maintenance carpet soap holder in shower house keeping was often done relatively late the area and staff are very good a little busy so had to queue for breakfast but was half term and guidance is given on busy times ate breakfast in ground floor bar area on second day but food was a little cold good quality breakfast good sized studio room for family friendly staff clean room clean hotel close to tube and all south bank amenities staff at the reception wasn t helphul at all was asked to pay although had paid for the stay the evening before after explaining my situation she requested a different card being not very fluent in english i couldn t properly defend my position after what she asked my nationality and told me you can go very surprised that a central london hotel can be so rude and insensitive deep disappointment and unpleasant feeling for the rest of the day location we booked a studio with a double and sofa bed the sofa bed is so bad i literally went to a e with severe neck pain do not sleep on the sofa bed also very surprised that no ow came to clean the room until   pm we had been out since  am location is great staff were great limited channels at tv limited sugar for tea hahaha and very limited milk it was not which we was expected for the value which we paid hmmm the bed was nice and clean useless staff in bar we had to ask five times if we could order drinks each time they said they would take our order at our table the final time we insisted they took our order at the bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks it wasn t busy i have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service it was bizarre helpful check in staff at reception your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when i asking if i have my room card and if i am a resident the talk continued for   minutes where every service which i originally came for was not available hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam but good job you took my money you are good capitalistsno positive the rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning the rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant i didn t sleep until  am you can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and i m a light sleeper also every time i ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road i like the location and the look of hotel the facilities are nice and the decor is of good quality room was too hot could not get the temperature down good size room and even though i did not use it i liked that there was a kitchen area with a microwave the rooms were not ready on time at  pm the queue for breakfast not complaints just points to note the family rooms are large and comfortable hotel convenient for london eye and aquarium a couple of little niggles fridge part of the minibar wasn t cold enough and the room was too warm despite having the air con on max perhaps it being so cold out meant they turned the heating up great location close to the london eye right next to waterloo station family room was a good set up with different sleeping areas for us and the kids and kitchenette was useful overall a really good stay the temperature of the hotel our room wouldn t warm up even after putting the temperature to max also the microwave wasn t present in the room as was expected to be included the breakfast was super delicious the layout of the room was spot on queuing for the restaurant at breakfast on checking out at midday decided to have a coffee in the bar area but the staff were still clearing away tables from breakfast seemed to be in no great rush this wasn t the case when i last visited last year nice comfy room great staff at reception paid for upgrade to see london eye big ben eye was fab view couldn t see big ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see big ben too need higher than  th floor also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included an additional   a head didn t seem fair when spending over   on a room lovely location and hotel really nice and comfortable shower creates a bit of a puddle as the door didn t shut properly hotel was absolutely perfect concierge staff were fantastic as were front desk which made check in out a breeze we requested a room with a view as it was a special occasion and we had an amazing view with complimentary wine i paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website what i got was a room on the   th floor overlooking the side of the park plaza westminster across the road and part of the construction site from waterloo train station very unhappy about this i was told at reception i could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view james quirkno positive minor things that i wouldn t even put the hotel down over it was our personal preference on a whole our time spent at this hotel was brilliant the hotel it s self is beautiful and the staff especially the room service team are amazing friendly and helpful we will definitely return again no negative breakfast the chef spent to much time tallkiing i waited   minutes for an egg and there was only   person in front of me this is the wrong system for eggs and omelettes he only did   person at a time when he could have put   eggs on at the same time kept   people happy room was a little too hot even when air con was in cold it was my son s birthday and staff left a card complimentary snacks and drinks etc kids pack was also great with euros for them to spend in treats additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building good personel and smiling faces staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the express box bedroom layout was odd tv in front to dresser instead of a mirror that was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal room was so hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good little confusing as there are   park plazas next to each other food drink is dear but its london so nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the southbank which we did but everywhere closed around     so hotel has a captive audience as it were overall a nice but pricey stay location was good check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant far too small when hotel is full especially with families they call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge elevators too slow for number of guests have stayed often in london but this was the least appealing hotel there are certainly many better options no positive poor cleanliness very bad wifi connection the bed is uncomfortable it really hurts my back and nick very slow service breakfast asking for extra money to get something like omelet so i cancelled location danish pastries croissants at breakfast were cold would have been nice if warm or if there was a way to heat up upgraded to penthouse room amazing view from extra large balcony and quiet double windows with foot gap sauna steam room gym very good and easy to access    am    pm very good location for london eye etc generous and varied supply of complimentary toiletries refreshments in room the only thing i didn t like was the fact that i had to come home the location of this hotel is second to none perfectly situated the bed was incredibly comfy the view was amazing and the staff were exceptionallly helpful very clean tidy and all round brilliant hotel with amazing customer service we paid for internet and the tv kept says no signal so we were unable to use it other than that our experience was amazing we would definitely visit again no positive dressing gowns were tatty and too small towels too looked a little tired bed seemed hot due to plastic cover pillows very comfortable tv easy to work view from room   excellent very good breakfast nice to have own pot of tea and coffee great to have a bath supplied as well as shower not enough lifts which means if you are on one of the upper floors then be prepared for waiting up to   minutes for one to arrive staff friendly and good location next to waterloo station     min queue to get to breakfast both saturday and sunday we did not arrive at the same time is not acceptable to a   star hotel our room was not cleaned after the first night until we asked for it around     in the afternoon no positiveno negative room was very spacious and we were upgraded free of charge so room included private lounge and kitchenette location was perfect to access all main attractions and easy access to waterloo breakfast had to queue for about   minutes and then when we did sit down had to queue again for hot food which wasnt being replenished very quickly so choices were limited not good value great family room studio apartment for my husband and i and our   year old grandson he was very happy with the room the tv and the great view the duvet it was too thick heavy and very lumpy made sleeping uncomfortably hot helpfulness of the staff and the little extras they provided for our childrens birthdays like free ice cream birthday cake drinks sweets and balloons the most awful hotel that i have ever lived in the staffs were not friendly and nobody helped us with our luggages when we checked in till we asked the heating in the room was either extremely too hot or too cold we couldnt adjust the temperature in our room we had to call to the reception to let people do it over and over again we stayed there for three nights and none of the nights were comfy definitely not worth for the money that we paid very disappointed we would not choose this hotel again and we are not recommend this hotel to anyone good location overpriced for new years eve paid   per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another   per night total extortion dirty small and below average room wouldn t pay more than   a night had to take   small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at    pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks rooms were empty because people refused to pay   they wanted no positive leave ahead at least a day for your laundry cos the dryer will take at least   rounds     hours per round to do your clothes half dry amenities are great big ben and westminster abbey are within   mins walk the room wasn t ready when we arrived at    pm our room should have been available    pm the sofa bed was not very comfortable room was clean staff were friendly and keen to help nicely situated close to main attractions breakfast was good with a range of foods to select from the beds were way too soft to my liking the shower switch wasn t working housekeeping seemed to forget their items in the room for   nights i stayed there the staff were extremely professional friendly and helpful arrived a little early for check in and the room wasn t ready they took our bags and said i would be contacted by txt message when room was available no sign of a text by     pm so called up to the desk and room was ready room was small fixtures and fittings were poor tap was falling off the sink great location close to the westminster tube and waterloo stations at fisrt the sofa bed was broken but we get change to another room we had an unfortunate situation my mother in law fell at the london eye area and fracture her hip had a surgery at st thomas hospital it was very close walking distance to the hospital and it was perfect the park plaza hotel was the perfect selection we enjoy a lot our stay despite that situation we were a group of friends and the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress stunning hotel in the perfect location staff excellent and so accommodating upon arrival was greeted by a magnificent entrance when we need a cab we were helped immediately we were   parents and child the added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa the elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms when checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people and no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go location is excellent across the river from big ben and parliament response to queries i didn t get any requested a room with a view when booking and in a follow up email as it was the first time in london for my children appreciate it may not always be possible but just didn t get any response also asked for information about family activities on follow up email as this is mentioned on the website again no response disappointing great location spacious and well appointed room we had to wait around two hours after the time you could check in because our room wasn t ready before my stay there customer services were very helpful the view from our room was amazing the bed is not comfortable the breakfast is always crowded limited options opposite to what was mentioned we had to wait for in long ques for a table for breakfast sometimes we were offered to have have breakfast in conference meeting rooms in another floor so as not to wait we were told that the breakfast is the same which was not as there was items in the main restaurant but not where we had our breakfast however they played cartoons which was amusing for the kids location and staff didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the london eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel also that the bathroom sink was blocked the burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments no ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another   mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold very poor also the pasta in the italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order no positive there were no face wash cloths provided this was a challenge no onsite variety store selling basic vacation items such as varied drinks confectionery items vacation supplies likely to be required bed was comfy service was excellent staff accommodating and informative room cleaning excellent attention to detail good etc the room inside room with view of the dining room could not open the window could not control the air conditioning was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs the tap on the bathroom sink was very loose the tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when i tried to turn it could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down advised reception of the issues after breakfast and   plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls both agreed that they were not right they also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off we spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered the front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return the bed was comfy and the breakfast was good there were a few lights in the room that just wouldn t turn off so it was illuminated even during the night also the wardrobe handle just fell off the first time opening it no major issues though the comfortable beds spacious studio room were excellent bathroom kitchen facilities were handy too overall a great second stay the shower easily overflowed the mattress topper had gone lumpy all the staff we interacted with were excellent really friendly and helpful delighted to be given an upgrade to a lovely penthouse suite room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning luckily with a   year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette check in staff member was extremely helpful and friendly helped to sort out my mistake of booking that day arriving by train a few hours later to find i had booked for a week later helped with sorting out a room with a view of london eye big ben as it wasnt available on booking com website we were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this there was no kettle even in the room until we requested one we chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason on complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested an offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night no positive ripped duvet cover shower was rubbish no more that a trickle we had to queue for breakfast we were located in the bar on the lower floor as the restaurant was extremely busy we had tiny tables and it was was freezing not happy about this at all the location we also upgraded to a suite at an additional cost which was nice and spacious for three adults no negative when we arrived we mentioned it was our daughters  rd bday and they upgraded us to the penthouse immediately just because and when we got to the room there was a birthday message on the window a card and balloons in the room it made our weekend this penthouse has the best views of london i have ever seen best room we ve ever stayed in by far sadly our   year old got sick and we had to stay an extra night and the hotel were able to move us into another room straight away sadly she was sick on the covers and we asked for new sheets whilst apologising the staff were more than understanding and kind to us and we can t thank the hotel enough the staff were incomparable   food choices of breakfast are too limited   decent room considering the price   room has microwave silverware and nespresso machine   good location close to waterloo reception staff we paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount   times again they were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement we also got charged small random amounts each day and there were   extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have it was lucky we checked the charges they refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic location laundry room was very compact for   people if we had been a hurry to get out it is difficult for   people to not keep running up against each other the big heavy glass sliding door on the bathroom was noisy to move location was excellent for london sights and theatre land rooms were well kitted out and bed was big and comfortable i have stayed in this hotel many times but on this occasion i got one of the smaller rooms didn t like the glass door on bathroom the staff are friendly and the location on the south bank is great room felt slightly damp the food was excellent and staff we helpful room wasn t ready when i arrived   hours later than supposed to be but was offered free drink x   to make up for it i was a little put off by the style of the bathroom door translucent glass slider because it didn t allow for as much privacy as i would like i also wished they had mentioned at check in that you use your key card to activate the light switches because it took us a few minutes to figure that out when we got in maybe they said it and we missed it bed was comfortable staff was extremely courteous room cleaning was superb location is great i also loved having kitchen facilities in the room the advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself the check in was delayed by about   minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room very poor check in and unproffessional no sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water there is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with the access to the internet on the tv is blocked very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price right in the city centre short walking distances to attractions toiletries were a bit scarce   bottle of each for a family of   is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems breakfast was very good esp since there was soy milk and gluten free cereal kitchenette in room was an added bonus staff very friendly and helpful nothing everything the rooms are as what they publish my son loves sataying in this hotel thisbis probably our third time staying here the staff and the facilities are great for a small family we were checked into our room   mins after check in time but they made it up with a bottle of complimentary red wine which we enjoyed that night would always recommend this hotel to friends and family more choice of films on tv comfy bed very quiet floor to ceiling windows made a small room light outlook onto county hall roundabout strangely great housekeeping v prompt perfect for a short stayno negative we got a free upgrade to penthouse which was amazing looking onto london eye was my daughter s  th so made it more special staff were lovely and very helpful ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better the bed was comfortable beautiful shower room and bath with elemis products tea and coffee making facilities in room booked for new year s eve spent   for two rooms two nights because told london eye view london eye view bull had to go outside and stand in street after bought tickets home page shows london eye they wanted another   pound to upgrade shockingno positive booked executive suite with view but the view we got was rail way station which was a bit disappointing was hoping for river eye view also there were   of us staying there but only given   cups wine glasses etc and when we called room service reception to request another glass we were told it was on its way but never arrived great location and late check out was good the staff were a little slow but vert polite so no faults loved the location and the room and view was to die for great value for money will defo be back we ordered room service after waiting an hour for it they missed the milk for our tea and the pizza base was doughy we were left to it at breakfast and had nearly finished before we managed to get some ones attention for a warm drink then they only brought us one and not two when checking out we never got the option or chance to give any feedback about our stay the chap that checked us in was very friendly and helpful the amenities in the room such as plates and utensils are not properly washed before being placed back in the cupboard the bathroom sink was clogged the first day we came in the bed is not very comfortable back support is not adequate there is not enough room for breakfast the location is ideal for tourists visiting the london eye and westminster literally no wardrobe space we stayed for   nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase not sure it was value for money over new years eve the hotel decided to charge     for the buffet in restaurant on new years eve which i felt was cashing in on the whole event they wanted to charge an extra   for view upgrade which i thought was cashing in bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar fantastic location nice modern rooms very helpful staff no negative we love the park plaza county hall because it is so convenient to everything london it is close to parliament westminster abbey and the eye we love the close pubs and restaurants the train station is two blocks away when we booked hotel back in jan   we requested room with a view of london eye in november had email to say our room did not have a view we could upgrade for   a night unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount so we had no choice we were on level   and waited on average     minutes for   of   lifts really bad on arrival we were offered breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on first morning there was a que of about   minutes for a seat in the dining room not what i would have expected for this class of hotel the beds and pillows were comfortable tea and coffee facilities in room that fact i booked a penthouse suite for new year s eve on the basis we had a view of the london eye based on the images used booking com on arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever view was exceptional there seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and booking com we arrived on christmas day and the hotel was fully booked upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though i specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children i even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this the staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the  th floor which was great the troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast overall we had a very good experience the location is quite good   min walk from the london eye across the bridge from big ben it is very clean and comfortable the staff is very friendly and helpful they literally saved our trip see the cons part bottom line very good experience ridiculously overpriced couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page staff unfriendly and unhelpful included breakfast was basic boring and cold bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for   months there for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day bed not made properly dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish would not recommend this hotel to anyone email i sent still unanswered well promoted looked ideal as our chosen location for watching nye london fireworks short walk from waterloo station management is arrogant and unhelpfull breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there reception is eager to add costs no positive our check in was delayed  times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many london hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general the friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of   bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill this experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over   per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels no positiveno negative perfect location a few walking minutes away from london eye super friendly and competent staff amazing massage good food definitely worth a stay looks like rooms are not cleaned properly we stayed for four nights on the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which i noticed later the teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and i saw it and threw away not a great evidence of cleaning service good location friendly staff overpriced hotel rude check in staff and customer relations long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price will never stay here again bvooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at location restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast we weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere sofa bed a little uncomfortable location was great for london eye etc good sized room kitchen facility and view great staff friendly and nothing too much bother food in the restaurant was nice when we went for dinner and waiting staff particularly good would definitely return my  th but now final stay at the park plaza county hall what has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations   night stay in a studio king family with plenty of issues   studio king is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation   lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor    mins the lift simply prioritises higher floors every time yes there are stairs but with a   month pregnant wife i shouldn t have to rely on them   breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace     mins average wait for a table   temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool   shower water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum   concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting   mins i had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time   lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel all in all an absolute joke yes i understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation what was my go to central london hotel is now a never again hotel not much to like the windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside it was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception the no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk room service food was low quality and very expensive our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well the sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the  th the hotel has     floors with no view at all no positive beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it hotel is in a great location for london eye and southbank rooms are well designed but bed a little hard hotel staff set up sofa bed for our kids to share which was a nice touch breakfast was really good too would definitely stay again we had to queue for breakfast it was worth the wait but not what we expected plenty of room with seprate lounge are where the children slept the children were given money to get drinks ice cream and chocolate from the bar area most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot the mini kitchen bar it is difficult to work the heater in the room it was a cold week we love the staff they are always kind and helpful also we love the location we feel we can go anywhere we want in london from this location restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow too many new employees probably due to christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help good location very clean and nest facility unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so i had to call front desk and they would control it to be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm i really liked the studio king room plenty of space for a family of four really clean benefitting from a kitchen area with kettle microwave cups and plates etc i like the fact there was a shower and bathtub some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away the service was excellent the breakfast was good fresh and plentiful dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down breakfast also needs more variaton good clean and comfortable rooms great location no kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities i borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door good location and valet parking that the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall not   the staff went out of their way to help by giving us an upgrade to a room with a view we noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar other than that this hotel is perfect the staff were attentive professional and so happy especially valentina and atila i hope i remembered their names correctly the christmas decorating was beautiful no negative loved this hotel great location close to the westminster bridge and overlooking big ben and the houses of parlament very central location for a london base sadly there was no hot water as the boiler had broken but they were working to fix it and did give us a complimentry breakfast beds very comfy staff very friendly and helpful the suite was cold the heating was not working it could not be turned up in december excellent breakfast i was very pleased to get eggs bennedict excellent italian food for lunch lovely suite friendly helpful staff breakfast at     was disappointing i had room service and food was cold vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning i suggest quorn or cauldron sausages tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the danish pastry was missing not enough milks sugars for day bed was amazing great nights sleep warm room quiet and clean shower fab julia at front desk was extremely helpful kind foyer is welcoming but waiting to be seen at checking in was very hit miss hard to know where to stand the room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest we were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate great location spacious studio room with a fab view of the london eye an unexpected bonus room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did staff happy to help very friendly for a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than premier inn watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice very friendly and helpful staff very comfortable and quiet room we were in a studio adjacent to the atrium whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise the bedroom is near the door right at the atrium it s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary on the second day when checking out i asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room   i believe so they could hear for themselves we got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken with the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out the staff was very friendly cesar at the door arranged for a topper mattress for the sofabed when we got back to the room later all had been taken care of the studio had a little kitchen glasses and cups nice for making a cup of tea in the morning and for a drink at night the location was great close to the london eye starbucks and waterloo station was only a   minute walk no negative we booked this last minute and were not disappointed excellent location and nicely appointed rooms kids packs were a nice touch and housekeeping delivered extra conditioner within   minutes when requested booked a family room no a c heating working   small children moved room supposedly an upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass spent the night in a cold bedroom not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs a very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office i still had to pay good check in rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel quiet room slept very well although it was the weekend before christmas it was still a lot of money for the   night but my choice and i accept that staff are always lovely cannot do enough to help the bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building smart room really nice dreadful wifi connection don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room useful things in the room iron ironing board microwave kettle a whole set of crockery for   hairdryer safe and fridge the most amazing view of the city especially at night fabulous breakfastno negative we visited to celebrate my mother s birthday i emailed the hotel beforehand about this and was delighted to find my mother had been upgraded to a suite with great views over waterloo and the shard there was also a card a bottle of red wine and some chocolates in her room to mark the occasion the reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and there were plenty of staff around in the dining room at breakfast to clear tables etc the location of the hotel is excellent we caught the river boat from westminster pier just across the river to greenwich which was a really relaxing way to travel also visited the view from the shard which is   tube stops away there are plenty of restaurants nearby thank you very much to the hotel staff for a great stay my only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning i liked everything how the staff are welcoming and make you feel like home with their lovely spirit i like the location the pent house is amazingno negative comfy duvet spacious studio ideal for up to   adults great view of the london eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons front reception staff were very welcoming and professional no negative the whole place including staff were so extremely lovely and helpful and just generally amazing there isn t one thing i can say against the place brilliant twin room but beds joined together moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete bathroom fittings loose and worn breakfast expensive at     per person good location a neat and tidy hotel friendly staff room comfortable but could be much better italian restaurant good value the view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant this rendered the room windowless like a prison there was no milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew the mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then there were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up breakfast was overpriced i know london is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning it was perfectly located in the heart of the capital room was compact and clean absolutely nothing free upgrade given to a junior suite on arrival junior suite had all necessary facilities and more as well as amazing view of london eye from the bedroom and living area staff could not do enough to help you breakfast was very good and catered for all tastes we have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience when checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for     minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until  pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my   month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip when we checked in i was asked if i wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which i did but was charged   just for doing so when i asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full english breakfast we paid   for didn t even have bacon the shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding in the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over london but on this occasion our view was the waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed finally when we was getting ready to check out at     we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at     we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that and when it came to checking out we was waiting around   minutes just to do so it s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now i feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else i will consider returning in the future but on my trip to london it definitely won t be at this resort everything looked very nice and clean close to london eye nice for couples attitude of staff the spa is hurrendows with only   lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for   fully grown adults the staff are exceedingly lazy rude telling us that if we wanted a cup of hot water then to go to our room and boil the kettle the room was cold and the a c s heating did not work breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary you would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated pillows were superb and the room was quiet also the location in excellent no negative the staff were all so friendly and helpful the room service menu was delicious with excellent range of items and speedy service the room itself was modern clean quiet and had stunning views of london queuing for breakfast is not what i like breakfast not ready at     shouldn t be scrambled eggs not eatable i prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso one of the two beds was comfy nice view breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well pillows not quite to my taste but i am very fussy staff friendly and helpful nice room liked the kitchenette got upgraded to studio great location clean breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait   mins to be seated no coffee or tea brought to table no cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited   mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait   minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up rooms was modern and clean my stay there was fabulous and i don t have anything that i don t like i liked how they took care of me i got surprised as well as they have upgraded my room to executive room with a surprise wine for my birthday that s sweet wi fi was rubbish i never got a stable connection at all dreadful musak played constantly turn it off room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing it s possibly a london thing but i felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at     for  ml became     even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross i changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received comfortable bed great view staff prompt with requests but not cheerful breakfast had a wide variety cooked pastries fruit cereal toast etc good facilities in the room coffee tea bath robe kettle crockery etc there was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus the staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away the view from our room was not great we faced waterloo station but i m sure the other side of the hotel could see the london eye the bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust the breakfast that was included was a full english buffet and was really good the location was absolutely fabulous close to parliament the london eye westminster abbey and waterloo station not a cheap hotel but for where it is and the fact that it fit a family of four into one comfortable room a rarity in europe the value is amazing over   people queuing for breakfast anticipated   minute wait got a refund really not acceptable at a modern   star hotel special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in waterloo station reception and concierge staff very efficient and friendly got a free room upgrade much appreciated studio room   was superb what a view fantastic in room facilities and very comfortable with only   lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait we like this hotel have stayed before and i expect we will do again the rooms are good and very well equippedno negative was very busy when we arrived but the staff were very friendly and dealt with us efficiently room was clean and tidy no complaints whatsoever great location in my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast the breakfast area is really small therefore leading to     min waits to eat we were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting   min it was not worth the wait however i appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff location location location you can not beat this location if you are traveling with kids we were steps away from the london eye and enough children activities to consume a full day when tired we easily walked back to the hotel the next day we were within walking distance to the waterloo train station all of the hop on hop buses stopped near by and the city buses ran through the night with stops very close to the hotel at the end of a long day it was great to lay in bed with big ben and the london eye as my view no need for an alarm clock just look up and big ben was close enough to tell you the time can t wait to stay here again very small bed check in staff not very friendly breakfast outrageously expensive bar crowded and dirty location was very good room and bathroom very clean proper coat hangers the first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for   years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments so as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts they are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile im pretty sure thats what youre paid for also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for  mins we finally got to the station running to catch our train from london euston time we got there we missed our train by  mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain you cost me   to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us i was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue the lady on the desk francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome the temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm a lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff they went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise i was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views we were overlooking a rather busy waterloo station the room was perfect good facilities just right amount of space for a family of   lovely and clean and comfy beds too we checked in early at     ish and was told to return after   pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about  pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another   minutes we complained as we had to be out at   and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor really comfy bed room was lovely view rubbish but very quiet so we all slept well i paid the room service bill before i actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute     i run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary the taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession i know how tight turnaround is there was only one t bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc the cleaners were also trying to enter the room at     and out check out was   we inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no make sure you get the right hotel the staff were very friendly and room service was very good even though we couldn t eat everything overall a very nice hotel with excellent views and the price is justified and having been ill for a long time this was a welcome relief and fantastic time was had by all we stopped in a exc suite with a city view we woke up to views of the shard very well worth the money i m glad i paid a bit more but as three of us were travelling splitting this down meant we each paid   for one night no negative hotel is very central we had a room with a view of big ben and the london eye lovely bar area and decent food we went for our anniversary and the staff made a real fuss of us they d left us a bottle of wine and a card in the room when we arrived the sofa bed is pretty terrible and i absolutely hate the door to the bathroom it s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy very clear and modern and the location is great next to waterloo and south bank the breakfast is great as well i wasn t to please that i was expected to pay an extra   to watch a movie i was really pleased with the service the staff were really friendly i also wasn t expecting such a massive room the air extractor in the bathroom ran all night i couldn t sleep past     the shower fittings fell apart when we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared we too had an overlong wait for breakfast no positive staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent the room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this bathrobes were very well worn and tired the bed was very comfortable the room was quiet and breakfast was available nice and early spacious room and good facilities kettle fridge even a microwave and crockery n a loved the location staff were excellent proffessioal yet very friendly would especially like to thank anna at reception for organising a little something special for my husbands  th made our weekend thank you no negative this location is excellent for families and travel it was very easy to get on the underground as well as walk right across westminster bridge and to all the sights the food was excellent the wait staff was very attentive both for breakfast and for dinner the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in london and didn t include breakfast it would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special loved the d cor cleanliness and ambience bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast delicious hotel staff location and breakfast all fantastic thank you park plaza for a wonderful stay i m very fussy when staying in hotels and this hotel didn t let me down on anything really quiet in the bedroom and a wide range of different clients who all apprared comfortable will definitely use this hotel again optional service charge which is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge double recovery not what i would expect staff very friendly staff gave directions to battersea which took us on   tubes and a taxi costing us approx   and took us an hour making us late when we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to waterloo costing   and took   minutes not impressed with poor advice no positive overall very happy with the room just the bathroom fittings were tarnished used it as a crash pad for a night while on business front of house was efficient and helpful twin room slept well room felt modern and well equiped room was quiet with window internal to hotel courtyard i am not sure i got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room as it was only a couple of nights however i dealt with it being woken at  am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great not usually this disappointed i love to stay at this hotel staff know me now and are always polite nothing to improve fabulous room with a view of the london eye room and bathroom very spacious with everything we needed given a gift of a bottle of wine as it was a special occasion collecting an award breakfast was plentiful and excellent quality staff especially magda were lovely and attentive highly recommended and will visit again inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty room not serviced one of the two nights had to contact housekeeping who put it right spacious room good facilities and excellent bed we had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being   on the booking also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning very helpful polite and friendly staff was my husband s birthday so they left a card wine soft drinks and popcorn for the children the bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room i was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all i wont be going back there anytime soon location was perfect having to que for breakfast i have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason the rooms are nice with good views up high understandably the hotel had over   rooms that needed cleaning however we were told   minutes and the room was much longer than   minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic the room wasn t ready so free drinks voucher were given and you could leave you luggage once you d checked out went to marriott county hall by mistake having known county hall before it became a hotel park plaza county hall is not at the old county hall although it is nearby i think it confusing to have a marriott county hall and a park plaza county hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than i did we were upgraded to a penthouse suite very swish would like to have had more time to enjoy the comfort seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for   before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before just consider also that you will have to wait circa     every time you want take the lift basically overcrowded for the facilities offered management not present never noiseless location i was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about     unlikely to return on this hotel all the while i thought i could experience   star experience it was not i was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the   star hotels i been through for a   a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearbyno positive terrible service when the room filled with water from shower   people came after   calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes so   of us and   of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out getting ready for our bussiness meeting breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables not worthy actually not a single thing no negative the staff were extremely helpful and cheerful from the moment we arrived and were helped with our luggage which was even taken to our room while we checked in we had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in bath and ill fitting screen no biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us also only one chair to sit on and we are two location great and staff friendly and helpful we had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in it was broken in the centre prior to our arrival however once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble staff were friendly efficient helpful the room was dirty dark without view even from the  th floor the service was slow we asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour the breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish we requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option we did not receive any reply when we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another   pounds per hour it seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked no positive while it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by  am i did not even read it until  am why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought the pillowsand duvets were perfect my only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well the sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them and we didn t get enough towels for the whole family we were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway also extra pillows would have been nice too the kids never complained about the sofa bed the room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room we had a fantastic view of the the london eye but not much of the city from the  th floor the staff were very friendly and helpful a great hotel that treated children warmly as guests it was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could the mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount i spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee i liked the location the bed was comftable room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door bed size is small queuing atleast     mins for breakfast not good at all location is great close to the main attractions e g london eye etc the rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy we had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this they did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again the location i paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working it was in a good location with a easy easy reach of the train station the room cleaning wasn t as expected should take care of their staff and follow up on their work the room has a great view london eye very good space nice bath large tv in the living room medium one in the bed room and very useful kitchen kit small but very beneficial we did not stay long enough nice room overlooking the london eye handy little kitchen nice size shower food tasted great activities organized by the staff for children over the week end security guards watching the entrance and requesting to show room cards to take the lift when i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented i had booked a suite and requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for my boyfriends birthday and got a fabulous big suite with amazing views of the london eye big ben the houses of parliament and also they provided a complimentary bottle of red wine and a card which was a lovely touch bathroom was lovely with a great large walk in shower the hotel bar was also great which serves food until late if you fancy a late bite with a few drinks breakfast was also great with a lovely variety of dishes and a perfect start to   busy days definitely would stay here again as it made the mini break extra special i hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door it was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy the checking in and out process was not smooth room was not ready when i was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready when i checked out i was given somebody else s bill i did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price i was charged the staff was very accommodating and tried to help make my stay pleasant claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast if you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby great views from our penthouse which had a separate living room and wrap around balcony easy walk to the southbank and across the river on a choice of three bridges staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before we waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready after a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity the delay did not help i did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel yet the staff were a smiley as they could be not entirely bad i stayed with my wife and   kids in an excutive suite the hotel is in a great location near london s famous attractions very clean and modern also food was very nice and the room was very well designed sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable room was very clean and the sofa bed made up on arrival very pleasant front of house staff allowed us to store our bags until we could check in as we were early requested extra duvet and pillows no problem liked the monopoly money the children could exchange for items nice touch you have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel there was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the tv set the bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white too expensiveno positive beds could have been more comfy stayed in a family suite during half term perfect as the two areas meant we were separated from our kids by the bathroom great view of the county hall and london eye staff very friendly and welcoming location is just fantastic and the breakfast was fab too sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy family room was brilliant small kitchenette with microwave   x plates bowls cutlery mugs tiny fridge but enough for mlk and a few supplies perfect for making snacks for the children sound proofing excellent room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping and it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping we arrived at    am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in london great although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however not sure they should have charged us extra given the view i think if you are going to charge an extra   pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view but we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from us the room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go you need persistence to get room service to answer your call courtney on the front desk was excellent the rooms were very well furnished big and clean the shower was superb a kitchen area was a welcome plus the hotel catered for food allergies the hotel was close to waterloo station near westminster bridge and the london eye london dungeons sea life the sofa bed was too squeaky and noisy the other bed was too soft and the rooms were too hot due to not being able open windows the staff were nice it was clean and the facilities were good long queue for breakfast but it was the beginning of the autumn holiday breakfast room crowded comfortable rooms excellent location friendly helpful staff breakfast far too pricey at   studio apartment was great location brilliant for all nearby attractions and waterloo station staff in the bar angela and georgia were very professional and friendly we spent over   minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out they definitely need more elevators this was our second time staying at this hotel and we love it it s so central with a great family room set up and the view of the eye always makes me happy this time there was a mistake on a room service food order but it was quickly remedied and the charge removed everything was perfect great hotel amazing location i will go back to this hotel on my next trip to london there is a security gard at night wich is very good breakfast had to queue for ages   minutes at least to even get a table queued right along the corridor very comfortable room and easy check in and lovely staff breakfast let it down a bit the food was nice but the organisation of the breakfast service could be inproved great location and service friendly helpful staff we arrived early and as our room was ready we could check in early which meant we could get on with the rest of our day no negative the view was amazing from our room and all the elemis goodies in the bathroom was a lovely surprise excellent location friendly staff can t wait to come back long queues for breakfast and then another queue to get fruit and toast we had to join the same queue for people wanting cooked breakfast restaurant to small for the amount of guests low water pressure on  th floor took ages to run a bath and the plug leaked and water was not hot always normally use premier inn and wanted to make this visit special v disappointed staff were helpful on arrival and at the main desk the bathroom smelt of damp drains room   no signal on ee within my room and wifi kept cutting out on my iphone breakfast selection was good nice room and free upgrade to a studio apartment room staff lack warmth all very brusque housekeeping woke us too early with insistent banging on our door repeated   minutes later i printed our boarding cards at guest computer in basement keyboard needs replacement characters almost completely faded and illegible comfy beds very clean tea making facilities and microwave in bedroom temperature control was difficult and bedding was too warm with no alternatives restaurant was expensive and meals a bit disappointing but plenty of alternatives nearby location size of room was good staff were very cooperative and friendly very convenient to many attractions and waterloo station microwave and small fridge were welcome the room was quite cold even with ac turned up to max there was no heating as such just a cool breeze coming out of the vents that coupled with mostly tile flooring made it a chilly stay the staff were very helpful and the overall facilities were excellent room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no fresh air hotel was nice room was terribleno negative the staff was really friendly and helped me in every way possible also my room was clean and the location of the hotel couldn t have been better rooms were a bit small but all we needed we were hardly in them except to sleep location was excellent could walk to many tourist destinations staff was helpful and polite restaurant was convenient with delicious food for the money that we paid there was no swimming pool and the beds were really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a camping bed i found that beds in a premier inn were a lot more comfortable the staff were nice and friendly room was pokey odd sounds from water heating pipe work that sounded like a dog room was cold we ended up switching the a c off one pillow each not two and bed wasn t as good as a premier inn breakfast was good and eden who assisted us at breakfast was very friendly service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism fabulous hotel family room was spacious and comfortable from start to finish this hotel ticked all the boxes location was fantastic too the room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast we should have booked the park plaza westminster bridge which has a better atmosphere the location room size for single occupancy was just too tiny i could hardly fit in   bags no view atall tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid the bed was comfy breakfast buffet was good enough and location was close to westminster which is tourist hub it took ages for us to be able to check out the staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up my husband i were waiting patiently for a long time for the   or   staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour it was far too slow we loved the size of the bedroom the bathroom was also lovely great roomy shower too nothing to complain about great location and value for money stayed her for our anniversary visit to the big smoke when arrived discovered there was a bottle of wine in the room as well as petals on the bed which made our  th anniversary even more special the room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put   luggage in and able to fully open them i like that the room has a small kitchen in it very convenient staffs especially concierges are very helpful great location near everything it was needed to ask for   hours late checkout i was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather i thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request i spent a lot of money during my stay i was just asking for   hours for free the staff did not call me i thought that they are accepting my request in fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours i was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just   hours it looked like stolen issue therefore i really would like to refund my money the supervisor did not care i confirmed to her that i will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her t shirt as a kind of the confrontation the location was good stayed in an accessible family room my husband and i had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall we expected much better quality for the price charged very nice hotel in a great location very clean staff very pleasant immediate payment request for room service majority of hotels accept signature on delivery receipt ideal location not far away from various london tourist attractions nice and clean rooms with amply sufficient space no negative excellent property no matter what the reason your stay in london if you wanted to be close to many of the tourist sites this is the place the life of the city this is the place and in walking distance i have stayed several times at park plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet this being my first time at park plaza country hall i expected the same gold standard that i have experienced at the other hotels i was staying in the penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means i expect penthouse level customer service i had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the penthouse the penthouse has an amazing view of big ben parliament and london eye the decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a   s era theme room which is not what i believe they purposely set out to do all of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that i exclusively choose to utilize when i am in london this experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to london that being said i reached out to hotel management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read hotel management promptly reached out to me after reaching out to them to voice my concerns with my park plaza experience they were apologetic and quickly spoke to the departments that i had experienced sub par hotel service to try and address any issues hotel management also was very generous in their offer for compensation to compensate for my poor experience even though i declined any compensation i was very pleased with their desire to correct my issues to be consistent with standard park plaza experiences after speaking with hotel management i feel more comfortable with the possibility of returning to park plaza can t think of anything we didn t like helpful staff very comfortable bed excellent food in the restaurant and very quiet given the location no negative the location was the main reason for the choice of this hotel close to all the activities we had planned and choice of parking room facilities were great didn t eat so can t comment front desk staff housekeepers were all excellent requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then the noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel nearly everything nothing an ideal venue for our visit great location close to waterloo and then an easy and comfortable walk via westminster whitehall to the west end very enjoyable there was nothing i could complain about the staff were extremely helpful they upgraded my room for free which had the view of the london eye they also left a bottle of wine and a birthday card for my partner the room was luxurious and had lovely elemis shower gels and body lotions in the bathroom i had an amazing stay and would definitely book there again every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel in addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not other than that everything was good the whole experiance that i don t need to interact with the staff everything was great we had a fantastic time the breakfast was the hit very nice and worthwhile and the italian restaurant is worth a try the beds and room we very comfortable and had a lot of space in for two people room no   we slept very well no noise from outside traffic very pleasant place to stay with family and tube station very close very helpfull and friendly staff reception was a not efficient i tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that i pay the first night i told her that it was better if i do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if i want to pay the rest of my stay so i thought that was really bizarre she wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good location is great reservation process for family was a mess moved to a room in front of the elevators breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table location is superb the breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get the location was perfect within walking distance of the london eye westminster abbey big ben and the thame river there are many cute restaurants close by eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned staff went above and beyond what was expected the situation of the hotel was very central both to attractions and transport the italian restaurant food was delicious the breakfast could have been priced lower it was a little on the expensive side there was a small microwave sink dishes and refrigerator in the room the bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room   the bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor the air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows ok once they were taken out the safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it the bed was excellent as was the italian restaurant  pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and i do not remember having been properly informed comfortable room big clean and equipped with basics for a quick dinner if not wanting to go outside temperature control in the room was not very good just a knob with no temperature feedback hard to get it right as there was quite a delay in the change location room was good microwave handy as well as a small cooler space staff were helpful and friendly this hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi we stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft the rooms at park plaza westminster bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable location is excellent no negative room extremely small so upgraded then upgraded again because we were so disappointed so the money we did end up spending could have been spent on a much nicer hotel room was freezing cold and took a very long time to heat up room felt commercial and not what expected bed was small always looked forward to the big bed in lovely hotels but not this one sorry but i wouldn t recommend on the plus side the view was good there was nothing to dislike room size was excellent upgraded to the city view worth every penny to see the sun coming up over london will definitely return check in was seamless although many people checking out dealt with straight away only down side was our view from the room as we was looking out over the old euro tunnel station but nothing the hotel could do about this and didn t want to move room as our room   was really nice nice hotel very clean and staff friendly plenty of choice for breakfast attractions are within walking distance and if you did need to get a taxi the park plaza opposite has a taxi rank with plenty of taxis waiting our hotel room had a kitchenette with microwave which was great as we have a toddler so was easy to warm her food and milk for the evening overall our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend we had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on kids were shattered so didn t help matters staff seemed unhelpful was this due to not wanting extras great location room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends very friendly and cooperative staff very good breakfast nice bar nice room located very closely to waterloo station big ben westminster abbey and buckingham palace i had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma this was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding overall staff seemed too busy the location was great for all the activities we wanted to do the milk and cookies bed time treat was also just right for my son and me n a   min walk to london eye westminster south bank waterloo station had a lovely room which accommodated us as a family of   perfectly breakfast was great too bathroom had a smell which we tried to mask with perfume also didn t like the frosted glass doors on the bathroom room was comfy breakfast was good would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper very friendly staff and family friendly as described lovely room with view of the london eye nice restaurant location is great ideal for exploring the sights of westminster the south bank beyond and easy access to other areas no fresh air no ability to open any kind of window it was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic i appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good location and views could not be beaten the cooked breakfast wasn t as good as i expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned the toast machine wasn t working either the rooms were very nice and the bed was very comfy the kitchen facilities in the room were an added bonus as above but rest ok room small but it is in central london the breakfast layout was shambolic the food under cooked meat staff wandering around not knowing what to do all in all breakfast experience very poor i never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in london after such a long flight the wifi is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages no positive elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded great location and views kind of a roundabout walk to get into waterloo station but very easy to walk to queens walk and cross over the thames to westminster small room the desk chair did not pull out all the way from under the desk mattress needed to be replaced i m used to having a flat sheet in between me and the comforter no wash cloths in bathroom great location modern looking hotel staff was very nice marianna remember who i was the next day when my key card didn t work bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover the suite was excellent for our short stay with family and staff were very helpful and friendly hotel was in an excellent location and hotel facilities were good there was nothing i didnt like about the hotel but maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice but i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought the buffet breakfast was had evrything in hand was well catered for has nothing went empty even the orange juice was well topped as i was drinking faster than water i was also offered veg sausages which was a surprise very tasty when i checked abit on the  st night at  am staff were helpful in giving a short car park space to allow my sleeping kids out of the car into my room my buggy luggage were taken up to the room after a speedy check in service allowing me to then go find my booked car park at briannia also prehand i was emailed the room might not be big enough for my kids allowing me to find a quick cheap upgrade to a bigger room my other questions were answered just as quickly i told the hotel it my  th anniversery in my extra comments when booking so staff can congtraulate my wife when we checked in or maybe at later stage they did one better by leaving a nice surprise im hotel room with a nice bottle of wine some fancy luxury popcorn strawberry cream flav for her belgian choc for me very nice but we dont dont drink alchol but i was well impressed with the thought effort put in the welcoming top marks also on the  st moring when we were planning our day out on sat moring on our way we forgot about the fresh milk to give to my   year daughter but the lady bartender saved the day in helping getting us some warm milk with no charge thanks the bathroom had a seperate door for shower which was not able to close completely and before we realized the entire room was flooded location is good but not there is no parking or taxis to stop near the hotels i prefer to include breakfast in the hotel rate i paid to be more competitive with other hotels in the same class the hotel is very close to waterloo station london eye shrek adventures sea life aquarium and other important points of interest we planned to visit the rooms were never made up until later afternoon despite us taking off any private signs on the door it was just too late to clean the room and the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel we had to wait way too long to get a table the location was terrific and close to everything we needed with young children the room itself was a good size and offered space for everyone to sleep comfortably we asked the reception to please pick up the laundry we left in our room and placed inside the bag in the morning before we left the hotel however when we got back later in the evening it was not picked up the bed was comfy and the room was great didn t get into room until  pm and that was only because of me complaining dirty sheets no toilet roll asked for more when came back just thrown in bathroom this is just half of it good location for the cost the rooms are small compared to north america but bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere staff were exceptional the location was key close to the london eye a block away and half a block to westminister bridge where you can walk across to big ben you can also catch all the tour buses there which for seeing london are a good bang for your pound drinks a little expensive but that s london bar staff lovely though did not have breakfast room perfect for   of us with sink microwave nespresso machine fridge kettle would definitely stay again breakfast room was quite small and and was some waiting for a table but if gone earlier probably wouldn t have been a problem friendly helpful staff great location for westminister and waterloo quiet hotel no unnecessary noise from outside or other rooms good selection for breakfast   pillows per person our door keys did not work after the first attempt the technician had to come and change the battery which delayed our trip out for nearly half an hour wee were invited to upgrade to a suite for an extra   per night and it was a good recommendation the restaurant was excellent quality and not too expensive we were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night we changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view the location was amazing we weren t too sure how far it would be away from everything considering it was over the river not at all superior location and only a   min walk over the bridge amazing hotel for families they are extremely accommodating to kids we shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed that was fine unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door my wife and i slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light i thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed seemed like a bad layout plan the pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the day and night very close to the london eye was a bit disappointed there wasn t a cafe or bar in the upper area of the hotel for all of the guests to make the most of the view it would have provided as i thought i d read there was but other than that nothing from our point of view the hotel is in an excellent position plenty to see do right on the doorstep great choice at breakfast the staff were helpful offering a discount   if booking in restaurant then finding out on bill it s only on food and you add     service charge without asking i always tip myself and hate automatic service charging breakfast a little chaotic but good value lovely beds quiet rooms attentive staff n a i honestly couldn t have asked for a a nicer place to stay for my birthday with my partner the view was amazing and the rooms where lovely as soon as we walked through the door we where greeted by very helpful friendly staff thank you so much you made my birthday extra special parts of the breakfast buffet were low quality one room had no natural light which i would expect for a room labeled superior rooms very small very clean hotel in a central location breakfast was included in price and was decent rooms were quiet and each had a fridge available paying   for   night for an extra city view room which is a view of the hotel across the road squashed breakfast tinned food not enough seats outside to tables faulty equipment room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our  th wedding anniversary and still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza appalling standards for an hotel which won an award helpful reception staff no cooking stove everybody we talked with was very gracious and hospitable the guest laundry was a very useful surprise the fitness room was exceptionally equipped for london hotel standards at check in they hadn t realised   adults and   kids so didn t have sofa bed ready couldn t understand as email clearly stated number of guests breakfast very busy but manageable location great size of room for   of us great separated lounge and bedroom and small kitchen area great for a family the view over waterloo station it is appreciated that this is unavoidable for a number of rooms but actually i might have paid a little more for a room with a better view very friendly reception staff good range of food available at breakfast and of high quality breakfast was disappointing great location for all sites in london and very family friendly kids loved the hotel money to spend on ice creams and drinks we had a family of   with sofa bed and that s the worse bed i have ever slept on there is a huge gap in the thin mattress and i somehow got through the night by putting some towels to fill it up the checkin took a very long time and the room was not ready by the time since they couldn t predict the time we decided to walk out for site seeing although we were tired after a long flight we loved the location and the breakfast absolutely nothing we will return the lovely letter left by the lady cleaning our room giving her number if we needed anything cocktail bar staff were amazing walking distance to centre of london security was excellent as all visitors to bar were asked to show a card confirming they were guests before gaining entry the breakfast was not good taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for at the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice location room and staff better facilities the a premier inn and well apportioned rooms breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation no where to sit in the reception area not exactly wheelchair accessible photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the london eye as the photos make out the beds were comfy facilities in the room were good room service was excellent very delicious and quick central location poor breakfast extra charge for the omelet which is unacceptable big queues very day after     for breakfast because the restaurant was extra small and you had to wait long for taking the lifts big rooms super facilities two tvs espresso machine cups and dishes with splendid soft bed and comfortable bathroom highly recommended for families with kids great location near tube bus stops museums london eye the staff were all friendly however i was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me i think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing the key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it also most important channels in the tv were not working and there is no looby as far as i noticed also we had a late check in at    pm on the arrival date no positive our view was just another hotel across the street careful when booking the photos seem to give the impression it is the hotel at the end of westminster bridge but that another from the same company can sometimes be a     minute wait for breakfast table as dining area is too small for such a large hotel clean friendly and a high standard in the room bed was very comfy food tasted great even the buffet breakfast the second bed in the suite room was very uncomfortable we had to wait for breakfast every day because the hotel was crowed and the dining room was not big enough excellent location we liked the kindness of the staff bar prices were a bit costly but had to take this in to consideration as we were in the center of london a really lovely hotel close to the london eye room facilities were excellent and loved the fsmily room layout with beds on either side of the room and small kitchen with tea making facilties sink and micro perfect if travelling with a baby etc iron and board was brilliant extra too loved the mini fridge bed was king size and very comfy we were located on the road side of the hotel but didn t hear a any traffic noise overall a lovely hotel with nice helpfull staff and would recommend a stay here to anyone the bed was too soft for us and nappy changing area not sign posted in the last cubicle in the female wc down stairs also should be in an area where dad can do nappy changes absolutely brilliant lovely staff goodie bags with monopoly type mony for kids to get a drink or ice cream great breakfast buffet delicious dinner very central room smelled of drains sofa bed not made up insufficient number towels toiletries for a family of three no tea coffee etc available in room breakfast long queue hot food cold no eggs could not have breakfast in mezzanine designated area insufficient capacity to accomodate volume of guests so served in a conference room not prepared location i chose the hotel as it stated that it has an indoor pool the spa was good but i was expecting a pool facilities were great my room was great value for money and the restaurant was great the rooms advertised as having city views were a little misleading as to view any of the city you had to press your head up against the window to look between the   buildings opposite although you could then see big ben nice big room breakfast was ok great location not a clean hotel or clean room wardrobes and cupboards covered in marks and stains glass in lifts covered in smears dust and stains as were the glass balustrades within the hotel rooms aren t soundproof as room next door had a baby in room which we could hear crying bar and restaurant food not worth the money convenient location good staff and family friendly breakfast main lounge was overcrowded at    am so had to use upstairs dining area then there was a mix up over our pre booked breakfast which had to be sorted however after that all fine very quiet room with superb view over waterloo and the city especially at night no negative overall had a great experience room was lovely and we had a great view the staff were helpful and my husband had a few surprises in the room for his birthday made our london trip extra special thanks xno negative i loved it all it was very clean and very well taken care of the staff was so nice and helpful amazing the location was perfect and near everything no negative a super location just few minutes from the london eye houses of parliament and restaurants along the south bank the reception staff were very helpful and friendly we also enjoyed a very nice meal in the hotels italian restaurant excellent service from our waiter this was a visit for friends jointly celebrating  th birthdays the birthday balloons and wine were a very thoughtful touch we had a great weekend and will definitely visit again more toiletries the room was perfect on the th floor with great views of the london eye and big ben the bed was really really comfortable and the room very quite great location for walking to to sights and especially south bank we were very happy and have no complaints loved our comfy beds all staff were so great with my children very family friendly great food we really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back sofa bed had a metal bar that was very uncomfortable the shower only had hot water no matter how many attempts we made no pool amazing location we didn t pay extra to face the london eye but were given a room on that side of the hotel the gym had everything we needed too no negative loved being so close to south bank and to waterloo station and that the room was spacious and very good value for money for a family of four and loved the nespresso machine in the room i think just a personal thing but i did not like the rooms as they did not have a window to the outside just the interior and thus they were dark the room itself was nicely laid out and the bed was very comfortable each member of staff we met were lovely very helpful and accommodating our visit to their beauty rooms was very enjoyable and we were very well looked after the breakfast wasn t warm enough tasteless mushrooms and scrambled eggs could be better attention to children and nothing is too difficult for staff i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization he claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than   nights i told him i was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written he said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies i told him i disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments i asked to speak to his manager he said i am the manager then i asked to speak to his superior then he said i will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount i told him this will not work as it will take at least   days to reverse the payment he said that he is sure it will take few hours unfortunately he cancelled it and took   working days during this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank i was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead

devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience had to move room due to an infestation of ants on arriving home and checking the bank we were overcharged by   for our stay hotel also said we used the mini bar when we didnt not happy location was great free wifi only  mbit but upgrade to  mbit just  gbp per day why so complicated no balcony fantastic location   mins to london eye right besides waterloo   mins to westminster great breakfast spacious bathroom good gym nice restaurant activities for kids the open area with the glass just waist high was scary with young kids the way the toilet and kitchen area separated the rooms my watch and file i left in the room was returned the next week overall for the cost of the stay i thought the food could have been better only had breakfast and it was not great cleanliness could have been better location not great no positiveno negative staff are very nice and helpful simply they care very convenient location close to main london attractions our stay was pleasant and if we visited london again for sure we will check in at this hotel stepping out of the bath almost required a ladder staff very helpful and friendly food in the italiano restaurant was excellent views of the shard and westminster bridge from our room mold around the bath inwards window so people from the lifts and on the otherside of the walkway could see straight in your room and there was no daylight in the room no mirror in bedroom it was nicely deccorated and in a perfect location waited past   for our room key and little extras tokens for the kids were not received until alot later after i enquired about them this was of course after we had our evening meal small problems no major ones on the whole a pleasurable experience room and location was amazing long wait for a lift great location on the south bank lots of restraints entertainment or just a walk along the river great views of westminster big ben somerset house london eye staff very helpful even when busy rooms very quiet great facilities breakfast plentiful room over an hour late and staff not my problem attitude i have previously rated my stay as very poor due to late available of room on arrival and terrible staff attitude great location dinner in the restaurant was delicious housekeeping staff were amazing did a really thorough job breakfast waiting staff very attentive in difficult and sometimes chaotic working conditions great views from the room waited  mins for the lift every morning because there are only   lifts for the whole hotel breakfast was overcrowded and queues most morning as the facility wasn t big enough not enough breakfast variety and dishes frequently were empty room was very warm as aircon didn t work well enough it would have been great if there was a pool or even the option to use the pool in the park plaza just across the road i was disappointed that they no longer have an executive suite it is still mentioned on the website so i had kind of expected it with the room we booked the beds could have been more comfortable but maybe they are just a bit old the location was fantastic and we upgraded so had an amazing view of big be and the london eye the seperated space for the sofa bed was great so that my husband and i didn t have to go to sleep when our   year needed too the housekeeping staff left a little note and a fun size mars bar for each of my little boys toys cause they looked hungry i love little personal touches like that bit expensive for food and drink were told we were upgraded but the room was as last visit kids were at the rear view not at the front good location staff attentive but not over the top bit free bottle due to room not been ready nice touchno negative great location to explore the city good size suite for the entire family could do with a toaster but may be a fire hazard otherwise good to have a kitchenette nothing of note left luggage service once we checked out was useful and saved us money nespresso machine in the room was great soundproofed rooms were indeed soundproof restaurant staff seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving guests then a little snappy when we asked another server for help reception staff were friendly and very helpful room was clean and quiet i ordered   burgers for d kids on saturday as we were meeting my niece and boyfriend for dinner and d kids were hungry and wanted to eat straight away so i asked for   plain burgers with nothing only the bun i informed them they were fussy eaters and wanted nothing more i was asked would i like chips and i said i portion of chips i got the   burgers with just the bun with loads of salad and garnish on the side and one portion of chips and was charged over   pounds for this included in that were two teas i think it was a ridiculous price to be charged for two burgers when i looked at the menu afterwards i guess they gave me the burger on the menu which was     each it says on the menu there was a kids menu and the waiters knew they were for kids i think it was a ridiculous price and we didn t eat anymore there after that to me it was a big disappointment location comfort easy access staff friendliness lovely rooms spacious child friendly nothing very comfortable bed and good in room facilities inc microwave large tv great modern restaurant at the hotel excellent food very reasonably priced for central london hotel located very close to london eye houses of parliament tate modern lots of bankside restaurants a good   star hotel highly recommend the view was a big disappointment paid a lot of money for a suite and double room to have a fantastic view for one night it was a very ho hum view over industry and train station yard bathrooms were just ok with sliding door and smallish comfortable beds central location the room was overpriced the bathroom was cramped the place lacks decor and warmth lifts too slow and crowded overall not a great stay the breakfast was good the room is starting to look slightly tired reception was noisy and not particularly attractive didn t bother visiting restaurant because of this bed and sheets very good kitchenette very handy and there is extra space in fridge for your own things very noisey place and we were woken up each morning early by the cleaners we did not sleep very well in the two nights we stayed great location and very friendly staff i didn t like extra charge from my visa i discussed with them they said your write we going to return back till now many days not refunded i complain but nothing done they charged me extra money     i compliant they promised me to refunded but not returned back no smell in the first place and a warmer room but as stated both were resolved quickly we reported a smell coming from the bathroom it was dealt with very quickly room was cold an adjustment was made by your engineers quickly queue at breakfast time a bit annoying needs a bigger restaurant room for   people is very small and cramped but guess one has to live with that great location fabulous breakfast kid s meal in the bar great value for money overall good value for money don t have breakfast in the overflow room food tasted like it had been cooked for hours and wasn t hot the location is great very easy reach of the london eye south bank and westminster the shower was terrible difficult to operate and just a teickle of water hard to get into due to the height of the bath the location was amazing friendly helpful staff bed not particularly comfortable had a topper and extra under sheet neither of which fitted and stayed put during the night friendly staff excellent location for waterloo station the quilt in our room was a bit too thick which made us sweating even we had turned down the room temperature to very low excellent location within walking distance to all major attractions in london the service of all the front desk and concierge staff that i came across with are all enthusiastic good the room size is good considering it situates at such an excellent location not mad on an internal facing room i like natural light and it felt a little claustrophobic but that s me good location v friendly staff special mention for kim who was extremely helpful and polite there was obviously a drainage problem in the bathroom so the room smelled terrible i wished i d complained earlier as when i did complain it was too late for the hotel to do anything about it and they didn t seem too bothered about it either the hotel is pretty tired and the staff weren t very friendly either not the best experience we have had good location not enough dining space for breakfast limited fried eggs one per person room on second floor overlooking another hotel room in the front despite of paying premium price location sofa bed microwave cutlery staff kids play area washing machine at the basement was all helpful as we were travelling with toddlers and stayed   nights size of studio king room was great for family of     young kids no window for natural light room was internal and the air con was very cold even when altered or the room became very hot without bed comfortable with fantastic pillows and quilt staff very obliging breakfast is over priced for what it is worth and flow of busy times are not managed well due to lack of staff at least a complimentary bottle of water should be offered with room for the price of one night very friendly staff and good supply of toiletries in the room nothing i didn t like well done everything can t wait to stay again would definitely recommend this hotel would use this brand in other locations very unhelpful and unfriendly and unflexible managment we wanted to change the room we booked in the beginning because no one mentioned the room we booked does not fit the guest amount however they were complicating it no positive bar breakfast we had to wait  mn in the queue cool system flowing on the ground family room too small tv couldn t be seen totally from the bed i will never recommend location chaotic concierge could not handle the volume of luggage arriving overcrowded breakfast room breakfast was an uncomfortable experience insufficient lift capacity long queues for lifts at times very comfortable beds the restaurant of breakfast was too small for huge hotel we should to wait about     min to set in a table the value of money was over to this hotel location friendly staff room the tv was a bit small and the sofa bed was really hard but our son didn t seem to mind the location was fantastic we requested a room with a view and could see the london eye from our window they had ac which was crucial since there was an  f heat wave in london that week and the staff was super friendly and helpful loved it no negative the checkin staff were really helpful and made a fuss of my little girl the extra effort to chat to her and ask her questions made her feel very special bed was comfy and room well equipped restaurant too small to cope with numbers at breakfast hotel advertises rooms with views of london but our room faced inwards ie no view excellent breakfast and evening meal the beds and pillows are not comfortable and under the sofa bed was not cleaned plastic bags and crackers and the shower box not cleaned well and a bit broken location and the amazing view the minibar was well stocked but the prices are unfairly high make the price of drinks reasonable so the customers won t have to purchase the items from an outside source also water runs on the bathroom floor after taking a shower nothing a couple of towels won t fix though nice location as advertised the room could have been cooler although i didn t contact the front desk to see if they can fix the a c very friendly staff very close to the waterloo station but you need to know which exit is closest to the hotel it s also located on a busy street but we barely noticed the noise on the  th floor i would stay there again just some information about how to use the transport taxi buses underground and parking and also remind to pay the congestion charge location and style staff really nice not false needed a curtain between bedroom and sitting areas budget toilet roll junior suite was spacious for a young family and clean location was good lovely hotel with excellent staff food in restaurant was lovely the sausages were a little bit pale looking for my liking and the restaurant got very busy at breakfast with several people queuing but luckily we got down early enough to avoid the wait great room lovely staff who welcomed my two boys and have them vouchers for icecream at the bar which was a really lovely gesture for us great products for the bathroom felt very relaxed best value for money in london the restuarant was good however they did not have non dairy milk to cater for those with lactose intolerance or vegans would have loved to have either soya or almond milk we had booked a double room but were upgraded to the studio for free the room was wonderful and spacious the bathroom was also amazing it had both a bath and a big shower absolutely loved the room very busy hotel breakfast room crowded and noisy inconsistent housekeeping in terms of towels left etc but this was remedied immediately fantastic location very accommodating staff breakfast buffet generous but overpriced family suite perfect for couple with one or two children liked having kitchenette very clean i guess maybe a fan in the room ac works great im just not used to the humidity the pure fact that your in walking distance from a lot of the beautiful sites the bedroom soundproffing was really poor as we could hear the client of the next room snoring at night the location was great and the staff were really nice check in could be quicker we were lost and ended up at the wrong park plaza hotel and queued for check in and were then redirected and queued again very pleasant staff no smoked fish was displayed at breakfast but on request a special dish was prepared for me large well designed and equipped room which was quiet as requested the bathroom could have been a little bit more private a almost see through glass door is not appropriate for everyone and it s not sound isolated either the hotel lies within minutes away from big ben and london eye waterloo station is the nearest underground station and it will take you anywhere you want in london perfect lacation didn t like the restaurant as tables were too close together and the pillows on the bed were very soft it was the ideal location for sightseeing and showing our amercian friends london all the staff were very friendly we told them it was our friends anniversary they put a bottle of wine in there room plus a lovely card no extra pillows available on request king size bed was a small king air conditioning was not working properly on a hot day and no windows to open location is excellent one lift was out of action for the whole of our stay quite long waits location was great for us staff helpful nice upgrade to a suite which was lovely thanks the lady cleaning the spa could ve been abit less snappy moany but apart from that it was all good me and my girlfriend loved everything about the hotel and would definetly come back dining area was very cramped during peak breakfast time with little room to move between tables when going to the buffet area staff were very helpful and professional at all times room was compact but of a good standard good selection of food at breakfast time no negative upgraded room for a relatively cheap price on the day of arrival got a penthouse suit with balcony overlooking the london eye and river fantastic stay the fold out couch had dirty used tissues in it and it was extremely uncomfortable the double bed was also very uncomfortable overall just not worth the money the food from room service was really good the bathroom was really nice as well the view was nice but not fantastic the bedroom was comfortable but didn t like the window overlooking the atrium bathroom was a wet room which flooded all the floor when the shower was used not ideal fittings in bathroom tired old and some broken towels old and grey only stayed   nights would not have liked to have stayed longer expected better from the rate which is charged the location beside the london eye and westminster bridge was in walking distance of a good few attractions the breakfast area and food was very poor for a four star hotel it was all selfserving so the cooked breakfast was luke warm where u eat had s caffeine feel about it this is very poor for the moneyno positiveno negative i stay in two different time first from june   to july   problem with air conditioner made   claims no properly protection in the shower and flooding the floor second time from   to   of july different floor everythind is new i had no problem good the way the crew of the hotel was very good requested high room with view affirmed that this could happen but asked to wait half hour while room prepared two hours later and repeated visits to reception to check room was finally available no view when querying this was told that no twin rooms had views of london eye should have been told this in first place and would have not had yo wait for room diasspointing sevice beware located close to waterloo station being ripped off because of the conference that was being held there not paid for by corporate but charged same inflated price isn t fair in ordinary holiday or leisure customers the overall atmosphere is always pleasant staff and rooms very nice regular customer at park plaza city hall london unprofessionalism untrained staff getting authorisation from my guests s cards without prior notice drinks served in dirty glasses in the restaurant no positive the room did not smell nice the view from the room was the worst we ve ever had the room was comfortable and the separate shower was nice the kichenette was also nice to have the drain in the bathroom had an unpleasant smell the executive suite we were upgraded to at no extra cost was very spacious comfortable the staff were very helpful friendly nothing it was perfect we loved the view from our window of big ben and the london eye the two boys aged   and   loved the park plaza euros to spend at the bar i thought this was a brilliant idea everything was great at the hotel until breakfast which was a shambles long line of people waiting to be seated tried to push   of us on a very small table for   and did not like it when we refused to be seated until they found a table for   people hotel was very comfortable we had a junior suite which was super food and drinks very good and not over priced toiletries also first rate concierge is very week they said they made a booking for airport taxi for me by the time arrived they said no taxi location price service ratio is very good couple of negatives no hd on tv and breakfast area was busy and a bit open for my taste the receptionist was really nice and friendly had an upgraded room location was great price expensive as per all of london executive room was nice wasn t reasonable food breakfast despite being a superior twin room the room was so small that the beds were pushed together like a double bed the hallway was being decorated on our floor which meant decorating sheets and paint smells although they did seem to finish in just one day although not in the old county hall building as we believed the hotel was very clean and the bathroom and shower were very good no negative this is in a great location for exploring the sites right by the london eye and cheaper than the park plaza opposite don t be put off by the outside the rooms are modern and staff are really friendly and helpful there s a handy italian restaurant on site if you want a night in with good food at a reasonable price you might even get an upgrade we were given a suite on arrival which had a small lounge area kitchenette and big comfy bed the room was really quiet and super clean would definitely recommend the house keeping can be improved the staff forgot to replenish the tea and coffe amenities frequently comfortable and spacious rooms with extremely helpful and pleasant staff the security of the guests is taken care of very well specially late at night when the staff never fails to check if you re an actual guest at the hotel but of course with great politeness no negative staff were friendly and helpful we were upgraded to a room with a balcony on the top floor and the views were amazing really made my trip remorable room was clean and tidy would definitely recommend can t think of anything studio room was very spacious and ideal for   small children staff were very helpful children s free activity packs were a great idea the breakfast is exactly the same each day which can get a little boring a lil variety would go a long way the location size of room cleanliness facilities all top notch dust in tv table that accompanied us througout our stay not renewing some amenities daily room service is expensive given the quality and quantity of the food location staff views gym bed linen room breakfast slightly pricy but not overly so attentive service and a well managed check in we ended up being upgraded which was amazing city skyline and london eye views were stunning very well appointed room helpful concierges meant never waiting for a cab breakfast was little pricy but a very pragmatic approach to feeding the kids easy walk from waterloo which connected directly with euston station so straight to the heart of the landmark district the price it is expensive but you definatley get what you pay for here its perfect fantastic hotel made the kids really happy with free colouring book yoyo wrist bands and pretend money to spend at the bar on chocolate the rooms were bery clean and tidy and also staff were friendly i would go again drinks in the hotel bar were far too expensive bought   basic drinks at over     meant that no more drinks in what was such a beautiful hotel bar no vfm fantastic staff who were very helpful from front desk and concierge through to the smiles on the faces of cleaners nothing really had to ask for bathrobes but these were instantly provided so not a problem we were given an upgrade to a studio with a little kitchenette coffee maker fridge late check out at   o clock ideal the room was ridiculously small impossible to pull chair out from the desk as the bed was so close not a choice for business travellers the staff were wonderful was nothing not to like excellent hotel and staff the staff were very kind and helpful couldn t do enough for us we would recommend this to our friends if possible would like to get an interconnecting room and bring our children next time i even enjoyed the breakfast which i usually don t as i m vegetarian but one member of staff kindly just made me some vegetrain sausages thank you very much shower over bath with only half glass screen floor was very wet after each shower lost internet during power cut flexible staff eg chambermaids flexible on room cleaning time and reception staff allowed us to check our late very clean bright quite well designed room good bed nice bar and food power cut was dealt with quickly absolutely no train noise despite location being woken at  am by a wake up call i did not order being woken ten minutes later by a phone call then the teenagers next door slammed the door numerous times from  am to    am until i asked them to stop the manager on duty was not helpful and advised that i was not the only one woken up by the automated wake up call system he advised that at least   other guests were also called that did not make me feel better and there was no effort to mitigate my dissatisfaction the bed was very comfortable bathroom smelled like a sewer rooms were very small and cramped pull out couch in the suite was very uncomfortable breakfast buffet was chaotic and poor quality staff was helpful good location near london eye and big benno negative excellent staff very wide choice for breakfast and couldn t be better placed nothing was too much trouble from booking in to getting us a taxi when we left pricey but i suppose it is london one small point used the bath and although there was no visible dirt in it when i got in it was obvious that it hadn t been cleaned since the last person had used it location was excellent staff were exceptional breakfast reallygood hotel too old definitely need a renovation smelly drainage problem and rusty toilet utilities dark room smaller than what the photos shown noisy refrigerators changed the room twice and waste a lot of my time without any compensation not even a late check out for free the staff is helpful but seems they are adapted to the complains i doubt these problems are usual none a little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for and hey that s london lovely studio room on upper floor with view of london eye and big ben no negative i booked a junior suite and was upgraded to penthouse i stayed only one night   nights later i was back in london and booked the penthouse suite this time for the asking price the view alone was worth it london eye room i was honoured to be upgraded and may now always book their top suite rooms appart from that the staff were splendid the food super and bar very adiquate i grew up in london and never seen a view like this and a sunset like that i also own one of the most renowned sunset bars in the world and this came very close thank you for the amazing experiance one of the   tv s in the room was not working would have been nice if it was other than all was great the location is great easy to get everywhere and the room itself was fantastic although we had an upgrade the bed was situated by the entry door and the view over looked waterloo station with the shard way in the distance having stayed at park plaza before the scenic view wasn t as good as what we ve experienced in the past i e the london eye despite this we still had a pleasant stay and i would recommend the park plaza county hall no positive bed was a bit on the soft side great location very handy for the tube plenty of good restaurants and cafes close by within easy walking distance of london eye london aquarium and westminster palace customer service was very poor no bedding for my children had to wait at  pm for housekeeping to come and make the bed after e mailing to ask for a fan and told one would be in room we had to make about   phone calls to het one no managers on to discuss situation sunday and now it appears they have overcharged me great location lovely views across city the sofa bed for the children was really uncomfortable i ended up sleeping on it with one of the children as they wouldn t settle we really liked the helpful staff the food was great and the welcome pack for the children was a lovely touch up on check out i was inform that they didn t charge anything to my credit card i was asked to pay by cash i paid my bill including room charge by cash over   pounds they have charged   upon arrival to my credit card and another   on checkout i have inform my bank and waiting for the answer i will file this to court this was really disappointing location was good front desk some team members are very helpful and some not we had to pay full price for breakfast even though my wife just had   rounds of toast and a pot of tea the room was very clean and spacious with plenty of facilities bathroom really attractive and pleasant to use no negative we had a spectacular city view in a quiet and comfy suite the overall circulation areas and corridors were light and airy during our stay we enjoyed attentive service were delighted to receive prompt response to our special request for a room with a view well done big thanks to all would have liked a more varied menu for our evening meal all italian junior suite on the  th floor with views of the london eye big ben and westminster the location was great my husband also received a complimentary bottle of wine on his birthday staff were friendly and yet professional lovely bathroom breakfast was too expensive need some eat and run options as our tours left early each morning or even a sack lunch we could purchase the email asking if we had any special needs before our stay was a really nice touch i found the bathroom a little clinical reminded me of a stay in hospital room service food could be better studio room gives you a small flat feeling the bed was very comfortable loved kitchen facilities it allows you to prepare a snack or microwave a meal if you just want to veg in front of the tv after a hard day of being a tourist i would have been annoyed with the view given had i had to pay full price as looking into the atrium was fine for the cost and duration of my stay any longer at full price i would have not been happy i picked this up the day before arriving so the on line offer was too good to miss out on internet speed of  mb apparently i didn t test it as my data plan runs faster but there was no milk supplied for my tea a true travesty twin room wasn t ready but easily upgraded to a studio good views of the shard on our side we didn t have cold water coming out of the taps in our room due to mixer taps passing wasn t worth complaining about as we only was there another day so just bought a couple of bottles of water to drink and brush our teeth with very friendly and helpful staff they are the back bone of the hotel minor detail that i am a vegetarian and found the scrambled eggs too creamy it would be nice to have more egg than cream the hot chocolate was not proper hot chocolate either but again a minor observation the room was comfortable and was lucky enough to receive an upgrade the staff were friendly and approachable the service was prompt and professional the prices are high but really this is too be expected within this area of london the hotel staff were extremely helpful and polite and gave us so much assistance with sorting out the room and charges the bar was light and welcoming and the staff were attentive and friendly you certainly get what you pay for issues with media and tv wifi could be better and for the price should be free for the best connection the experience the premises and staff provide well presented clean and professional we had a meal for   people in the italian restaurant sadly the meal wasn t to a very good standard my main course was not cooked properly i did complain to be told that red bloody chicken was a normal way to serve baby chicken a lot of money for a meal that left   men still hungry over priced a complete let down no positive we arrived at     and it would of been nice to freshen up from our long journey but we could not get in the room until after  pm the bedding was fresh the bed was comfy staff friendly super location to the london eye food was excellent parking next door too small tight perfect location with great penthouse overlooking big ben good comfort nice gym sauna best in class breakfasr in room if i was being very picky then the only thing is i would have preferred a soft close toilet seat only because i have one and out of habit i kept letting the seat slam down on arrival we were upgraded from a superior room to a studio apartment which was excellent the bathroom was very nice with a lovely bath and fantastic shower the staff were very pleasant and the doorman was happy to stand out in the rain until he could hail us down a taxi the cocktails in the bar were very good particularly the pina colada we didn t manage to sample the breakfast but overall i was very happy with my choice of hotel had to pay for items in the fridge shouldn t have to when your paying so much very good location with excellent views of the london eye and big ben drinks were good and so was the italian restaurant rooms were very clean and comfortable we had a kitchenette some more bench space would have been nice the microwave took all the bench great location nice sized room modern and clean friendly staff the breakfast was amazing we were charged for something we did not consume but after several emails with their staff it was reversed so all good microwave oven in the room made it very convenient to reheat food making you save some money from eating in restaurants location was great very near the station and to the london eye nothing upgraded to studio suite we initially booked for the standard room and the receptionist was so kind and told us that she will upgrade our stay to studio suite the hotel s interior is superb with warm welcome the security guard and receptionists the room itself is very spacious and bed is comfortable there is a large living room that can be arranged into sofa bed sleep for two people we didn t use it since there was just the two of us and the bathroom is complete with shower and bathtub stiff and short bed sttiff sofa long dark hair in our bed sloppy scrambled egg dirty cutlery bottled bleached tap water warm friut juice with a glass no bigger than a thumb the lift nothing it would be better if the price could be reduced we were chosen as the guest of the day and so were given an executive suit for free the room was very spacious free fruits and wine were provided it was very clean two tv s coffee machine microwave fridge shower bath lovely view overlooking london overall lovely stay called to request early check in and was advised i needed to book an additional night night before to guarantee this was ridiculous as i only wanted to check in an hour or so earlier than the  pm time stated i declined this and turned up at    pm and was told the room wont be ready until   i felt this was unreasonable as i offered to pay for early check in as it was my sons birthday which is why we was staying at the hotel we wont be staying again family rooms were very spacious and clean staff were very attentive it took a while in the lifts to get to and from room bar area was a little small considering hotel was child friendly childs menu was not much choice the breakfast was very poor coffee tasted like the cheapest coffee you could buy not much room in breakfast restaurant or in the bar definitely not worth the money we paid the room layout location of the hotel staff very friendly and helpful i paid in advance on arrival and was disappointed that i was not advised that i could not charge our meal to the room would have been better if i had been asked if i wanted the facility to charge to the room although not a major problem the message light on the phone continued flashing all night although there were no messages we couldn t get it to turn off so just moved the phone so it wasn t annoying nice and clean roomy accommodation i liked the microwave although we didn t need to use it as only there for one night central location handy fridge friendly polite staff couldn t turn off the rather noisy air con in the living room terrace could do with some outdoor seating and a table disliked the sliding glass door to the bathroom penthouse suite was of a very good size well equipped and with great views sofa bed was uncomfortable according to the person who slept in it mattress was too thin and frame could be felt through the mattress bed was comfortable view from room was great staff were friendly restaurant was excellent and choice of foods for breakfast buffet were good my room was a bit hot and i couldn t regulate it but my daughters was fine with a   year old and   year old it was ideal and children were made welcome view from room overlooking bins and graffiti room service didn t understand our request and we finished up with   plates so shortcake and paid nearly   for the privilege very comfy room and bed the room was very warm due to the design and not being able to open windows air con too noisy to have on all night to cool it down the room came supplied with utensils should we wish to have our own breakfast in the room after not including it during our stayno negative on arrival i was upgraded to the penthouse apartment what a beautiful view the room was so spacious and the staff were friendly will definitely stay again the future duvet had holes in it and it was all stained curtains were dirty cleaner didn t speak english so got confused when i asked her to clean the room the extra bed was very uncomfortable no positive bed needs changing you ll still have a good night sleep on it but i would suggest changing it soon otherwise you cant complain really customer service was great the room was clean and ready for us when upon check in myself and my family will always stay in this hotel as we feel that it s in a very nice area the kitchen area is a plus i highly recommend this hotel to family with small children     service charge added to everything including drinks in the bar our room had a small kitchen area with sink towel and washing up liquid provided so a cloth would have been a good idea great location in central london very comfortable room with great facilities we were lucky enough to get a room upgrade and the hotel stored our bags for us on check out day the parking in the area was poor and the food was a bit on the pricey side the locatoin was perfect the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the room was very nice all in all a very good place to stay room service wasn t cheap and the tray charge and service charge hike the bill but it is clearly stated in the menu the location and comfort of this hotel was first class as you would expect for london and this area it is not the cheapest but the studio room and views were first class we used the restaurants in the hotel and the food was excellent though expensive but again for london it was fine children are well catered for and the staff very helpful will return again the aircon was terrible and there was no key to open the door room was so hot and stuffy which effected our sleep the room was lovely and so was location the tv were a bit small i think movies should be free and the internet should free as well even more than  mg other than that everything was great thank you mr daniel for the best hospitality no positive we arrived at    pm but room wasn t ready was given complimentary drinks while we waited we waited for   minutes kitchenette tap and sink tap in the bathroom leaked the sofa bed was old and uncomfortable to sleep on and water could be heard coming down the pipes behind the bathroom throughout the night the wifi was very slow the location was good few minutes walk to waterloo station the kitchenette was very useful microwave side space in the fridge and cutleries room was a good size separate sleeping area for the kids reception staff poor on arrival it was   at night and i just wanted sorted and into bed they wanted me to pay   up front for minibar and bar reception on check out first clasdno positive supposed upgrade to a studio when we had booked a twin bed settee was very very uncomfortable breakfast was reasonable location was good staff were friendly location quiet   price it s expensive about the room size and facilities sofa bed it s brok tv chanel it s pooring and few if you want see move through tv you must paid for that price   all staff they re perfect   locations is perfect check in was a little chaotic but provision of cold drinks was a welcoming touch when check in time is   o clock you expect your accomodation to be ready at two however a complimentary drink at the bar was readily given by the apologetic reception staff the accomodation was spacious and beds very comfortable affording a good nights sleep one lift was out of order not a massive problem but it did take some time to travel up to floor   very pleased with the room the service and the breakfast name suggests the hotel is part of the old county hall glc building which it is not but it is a   minute walk away and dont let that put you off bumped us up as it was our wedding anniversary and threw in a bottle of wine very nice of them and would recommend the hotel at   at night are bathroom ended up flooded because of a drain issue somehow the cleaning staff managed to overlook a plastic cup clogging the drain my belief is then that there s no way they cleaned the shower before we arrived absolutely disgusting the reception staff claudio especially was excellent very attentive and kind the beds weren t very comfy and the pillows were practically non existent the staff were lovely and very helpful the location was perfect and the room was immaculate i loved the living and kitchen areas my children were also made to feel very welcome with a goody bag on arrival the bathroom door jammed but no one s fault really as it was a   wedding anniversary they kindly gave us a free upgrade to the executive suite with a bottle of wine and a card signed by the staff too expensive room at times too hot no pool or sitting room to read kitchenette fridge too small and no toaster sofa uncomfortable comfortable room nice comfortable bed good location kept clean alwaysno negative the location is pefect you can walk everywhere the room was amazing with an amazing view the staff was very kind polite and professional it was my birthday and got a free upgrade a bottle of wine waiting for me in my bedroom and also party balloons couldn t had a better accomodation in london i higly reccomend park plaza county hall will stay there again next time i visit the city the size of the room too small bedding too hot no top sheet so couldn t throw the quilt back although there was a room temperature control but this was a bit noisy nice and quiet left some equipment there and the hotel send it me back promptly amazing and thank you i d be back purely for the professionalism of the staff and the fact that even my go pro is safe in their hands room wasn t that clean cup marks on tables everything a little worn some grime in bathroom hotel felt rather crowded especially the reception area lifts were slow great location staff on check in were polite upgrade was very welcome woken in early hours by wailing of the plumbing from room above next door horrible noise and ruined my attempt to catch up on a precious bit of sleep gave feedback on checkout they promised to investigate and fix but that doesn t help me much very comfy bed and linens all nice n clean good room facilities free wifi no negative first time i have stayed their and i received a free upgrade which was perfect after a long day at work extremely friendly staff and a lovely clean airy and quiet room a bit more information about complimentary upgrade we did not really need a studio and would simply have preferred a largish comfortable room comfortable bed with the room upgrade nothing at all could have been better have stayed here before and enjoyed the stay but this time we got upgrades to penthouse floor rooms and mine particularly a corner room was spectacular i think it s lob cation right by the south bank is excellent a short walk or tube ride to everything big sliding glass door on bathroom was noisy and kept popping out of it s runner small complaint really didn t alter enjoyment of stay very helpful staff room spacious with   young children breakfast and room service food excellent located close to london eye nothing the people whole place is absolutely perfect don t go anywhere else and no i don t work for them everything especially the free upgrade which they always try to do had a change of plans and couldn t cancel an unwanted night but think that was because the booking was made through booking com great location great price for london but most of all the staff were great all very friendly and happy to help old air conditioning doesn t work i put that on the coldest and still didn t worked bathroom water system very old it made a bad noise when we were there no place to drop off and pick up location laundry the shower hot water didn t get warmer than tepid had to boil a few kettles of warm to make a warm bath the room was spacious and the bed and pillows were comfy close to the eye westminster bridge all the highlight are a skip and a hop away the aircon wasn t working in our room on the hottest day of the year we called twice for it to be sorted and no one came or bothered to call i complained at check out and the staff didn t seem bothered not impressed at all no positive regular attempts by staff to enter my room also breakfast venue was full of young children creating a chaotic environment location was good and local to tourist attractions the tv should be relocated away from the desk as it s uncomfortable watching from a less than a metre away and get a bigger screen location is brilliant and federica at check in was a delight to deal with my room was given to other guests when they checked in i was out but my clothes etc where clear to be seen when i spoke to the reception the response was i am night staff so i don t know anything this was a surprisingly unhelpful and unsatisfactory response i also had to phone   times for someone to open my safe before the v pleasant gentleman arrived cleanliness and proximity to transport room not as described on hotel website poor service from staff plastic rubber sheets over mattress made the bed uncomfortable house keeping staff knocking on the door early in the morning on a bank holiday excellent location couldn t open my balcony door bed was far to soft and uncomfortable mattress needs replacing breakfast was plentiful but the ingredients were cheap this impacted on the taste which was not good at all eggs tasted powered sausages tasted like they had been cooked the day before bacon had absolutely no flavour cereals tasted old and we re obviously the cheaper brands orange juice was out of a long life carton i m sure it s a shame the hotel obviously try s to save money on the breakfast as this is a guests last memory of the property and it s not good i was not the only guest unhappy with it judging by the guarded whispers heard at the breakfast table great location clean friendly staff was offered an upgrade to the penthouse floor on arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful room was small and not very clean the bathroom door had stains on it room was very cold and it took a while to get it to normal temperature the shower handle was leaking location right next to all major attractions the cost for breakfast on a per person basis was a good   above availability nearby room was very clean with great facilities for my son including the sofa bed   noon checkout was also helpful nothing this was a great hotel courtney on the desk was a great lad he was so good with my daughters and was so pleasant and also kim on the breakfast she was really lovely and got my girls a hot chocolate they felt like royaltyno negative staff were friendly and helpful took full advantage of the left luggage service so we could carry on exploring without our bags would definitely stay here again the wifi was working but it could have been a bit faster but it wasn t a big issue helpful and friendly staff and the hotel is child friendly they gave my child a gift bag with some colors and toys and they had a program for children on the weekend no cold fridge had to use mini bar and ice from ice machine had a pizza in the restaurant not very nice very friendly and helpful staff great location very well kept cleanliness maintained etc came back after running marathon no room to sit in very small downstairs bar unable to get snack and drink should have opened upstairs restaurant to accommodate everyone eve before no proper menu in restaurant just a buffet which did not look very good staff friendly and helpful room clean and good size tv bit small bigger kitchenette and fridge bedroom which could be closed off excellent central location help full staff very clean was good value for money easy parking we ate in the italian restaurant on friday evening our waitress was exceptional but this was were our experience ended the food was truly atrocious my husbands spaghetti bolognese went back twice but was still luke warm my steak was below average and how a kitchen can not cook chips so that they are not rock hard is beyond belief such a shame room was great reception and front of house excellent as were all staff we came into contact with breakfast first class and particularly the staff on duty both mornings considering it was london marathon weekend hotel was very busy on the saturday morning well done to all in the restaurant for coping with a smile when they must have felt like screaming just the cost of drinking in the hotel bar is the major downfall of this and to be fair most hotels the staff are always very helpful room was fairly clean has been better in the past bed very comfortable room had no milk for coffee n hot chocolate sachets had no dressing gowns n complementary water romo had almost everything u need clean place tidy n very pretty very modern lay out n hotel food veryyyy fresh tasty and  h room service expected a bigger room for the price room had arrangements for tea and coffee but no cups mugs no dentalkit vanity kit in the rooms these are basic things expected in a room especially for the price paid and considering it is a   star hotel good location good breakfast selection bed was uncomfortable no robe and slippers room service drinks were expensive and served in the most tiny glasses water should be in the room on arrival some biscuits with the tea facilities would be a nice touch toast was cold pizza was substandard shower can be scorching no need to have a gauge that can raise the temperature to such a dangerous level friendly staff beautiful views tolietries good bartender great spa staff bed is not comfortable as well as the sofa bed low quality pillows small electronic fredge mini bar auto charge on moving stuff nice small loby laundry room i prefer wooden floors and windows that open so hard to find in the uk the light inside the closet wouldn t go off no matter how firmly i closed it which was annoying as it was right beside the bed the location was great next to waterloo and very close to the london eye you can walk to big ben in about   minutes breakfast was excellent with a good choice our room was quiet and the bed was comfortable quick check in and out i had a room to the inner side w o a real window the price is rather high very centrally located next to westminster standard business hotel with reasonable comfort no negative the staff were really helpful amazing with our   children in both the bar area restaurant the hotel was clean well maintained in all areas that we visited we were upgraded too which was absolutely fantastic made our stay even better no negative silvia gave us free drinks and a room upgrade to a suite with a beautiful room as it was my  th birthday the breakfast was extensive and everything was being cooked regularly so was nice and fresh couldn t fault the room it was immaculate everything was perfect for my special day i had requested for early check in inspire of positve email earlier the check in staff declined me early check in this was very disappointing also being a club carlson member did notbenefit me in getting an upgrade or better response room was very nice and clean the sofa bed the room was for   adults but had a sofa bed as we had a child with us which was ok but not very comfy the staff were excellent and very helpful they couldn t do enough for you in the way of seeing to everything you needed during checking in out and also at meal times no negative great hotel with great staff bar was expensive but the bar staff small touches and facilities great the choice and quality of the breakfast buffet was up there with more expensive hotels thoroughly enjoyable stay the bathroom had a smell of drains the whole time we were there if we left the bathroom door open then the whole room stank informed reception who were very apologetic also we arrived at the restaurant at  pm and were told we couldn t use it as they had a booking of   people due it didn t look too busy as there were plenty of empty tables but we were told we had to use the bar instead so we went elsewhere perfect location for london eye and lovely walks along the south bank i ll be going back soon lovely hotel the room we had included a little kitchen with microwave which is very useful very limited in room tea and refreshments no bottled water etc a bigger fridge would be helpful for families sofa bed mattress was very hard but slept ok though room was quiet and well positioned for views over westminster appreciate being given this as one guest would have felt very uncomfortable without really could not fault the place amazing views staff very helpful fully equipped facilities from gym to bar so whether you are staying for business or pleasure all your needs are taken care of hotel needs more than location to be good hire better staff worst hotel ever i had booked penthouse suite for   night i would never ever use park plaza brand anywhere in the world park plaza county hall should be a case study on how to lose customers check in early check in request was met with callous attitude the front desk seemed to enjoy the ordeal seeing us in distress of red eye from washington with an ill family member all the front desk members were doings were enjoying my frustration asked me to come back at  pm as the policy stated i walked in exactly at  pm guess what room wasn t ready excuses and stories followed i didn t expect early check as a right but   problems   attitude of staff   weren t ready with room even as per written policy they played usual practice of offering me free breakfast which i refused and did not use room poor and dated furnishing cheap furniture wardrobe doors did not close air condition thermostat buttons don t work for setting the desired temperature you have to call the desk and tell them and they set it from maintenance room somewhere room was freezing again at night causing my family members sickness grow bad and no one could sleep silver lining checkout was smooth with nice staff manager intervened during check in and tried to damage control sounded more constrictive and sensitive hotel needs to hire such people everywhere location poor bathroom shower leaked all over the place and poor control of water flow no where to hang towels or bathrobes one bedside light didn t work what is it about hotels in this category where there s no mirror above the dressing table great location breakfast not included and u have to pay   per adult but they were clear from the bigining and mentioned that on booking comfortable good location car parking near the hotel   per day children can enjoy watching movie at the coffee bar at   pm free good wi fi and they can clean your room with flexible time upon request breakfast was     each which is very overpriced and even more so for small children not too sure where the decking area was where you can have a drink which is displayed in the pictures overlooking the london eye which is misleading excellent location rooms spacious and bathroom also spacious with excellent room facilities very modern rooms which were very clean too staff very helpful and friendly also had activities for children too the pull out sofa bed was a little uncomfortable as the mattress wasn t very thick fairly understandable i suppose really good staff great breakfast and the bathroom was probably the best i ve seen in a hotel of this standard lovely to have a separate bath and shower which was really big stayed twice now and both times been charged for things we have not used we also had to change rooms as first room did not smell to good the room was nice and the location was perfect room not cleaned next day had to request this bathroom smelled of rotten eggs the whole stay overcharged on mini bar bill had to prove we were staying there to concierge on  nd night to get into our room the location was excellent the gym and sauna looked good the bar area was nice unfortunately we experienced a couple of problems with the restaurant and bar food which we considered to be of less than excellent quality and not sufficiently hot when served the bedroom was very well appointed and the bathroom was excellent not worth the money expensive and they even said they cant give us an hdmi cable so we could connect our laptop with the tv and the front desk guy was even rude when we asked i was very disappointed the rooms are smaller then they look on the pictures location bar area a bit like a wimpy bar also the restaurant area was more like a canteen however the food was far below even a canteen standard wouldn t touch the cooked breakfast on offer made do with fruit toast and coffee nice clean modern room if with a gloomy outlook over work courtyards there was a party one evening and the music was very loud until around   am i round suggest that families should be higher up in th hotel if there are functions planned food was great in the restaurant accommodation was great we had a family room breakfast could have been warmer cooked food tasty but a little cold coffee really hot and good staff very helpful and professional plus friendly room better than expected couldn t fault anything our stay was perfect this was the second time we have stayed there very friendly staff room comforts nearby to everything we visited beautiful hotel very clean on our second visit we were upgraded it was a very pleasant surprise and loved the room and view spectacular thank you attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in studio was smaller that i expected it came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee also fridge space could just about accommodate a   litre milk bottle not enough toiletries provided for a family of four two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time there seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the friday and saturday night not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny also black algae in our shower surround had to repeatedly get key card reactivated room was showing signs of wear and tear faucet tap was loose mirror was cracked worst of all was the stench from the drains this was stifling some times usually at night location close to westminster bridge soundproof completely missed the storm on sunday night housekeeping left a nice message and some sweets for the kids on day   ice making machine on our floor swift action taken to rectify faulty faucet when the problem was reported to the front desk relieved to be able to block authorization of purchases from exorbitant minibar tiny serving of jelly beans was   terribly tempting for little hands express checkout nothing we changed from a very bad hotel to this hotel and this was just fantastic everything about it from the staff to the room amenities cleanliness were amazing cannot fault this hotel in any way i am pretty sure when i booked it was suggested that breakfast was included but this wasn t the case parking information on area wasn t great although we did find a great deal after some searching other sites online given location i was expecting much smaller room size but very adequate for the   of us location meant we were short walk from all attractions have stayed in a junior suite for several nights very bad house keeping not even a   star level leaving areas unclean never changing the bed sheets unless you told them they failed most of the nights to fill up nespresso capsules one night the whole floor was lost power it was returned back after half an hour without any apologies buffet breakfast was below average   per person the waiter asked for extra   for an omelet nice location overlooking london eye big ben in case of high floor having the right side well it s london so parking is a drag convenient to local attractions and a family visit good sized suite which the kids loved and great bathroom with walkin rain shower and large bath just that it would have been better if she didnt have to walk across the walkway as she has a height phobia but you didn t know this this booking was for my sister in law s  th birthday the hotel did everything to make my sister in law husbands stay perfect so thank you breakfast was very busy at peak times too much queuing for our liking but the food was good quality location was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful we ll definitely be back both of the taps were warm so i couldn t get any cold water the dish towel was not very good and did not dry the dishes well i really liked the shower and the bed was very comfortable a small thing it was difficult to get a fresh fried egg at breakfast time the egg fryer was not very cooperative and often unavailable they charge extra for an omelette we had a suite with a kitchenette so plenty of space the room had a coffee maker plus a kettle microwave and small sink all of which were kept very clean the staff were very helpful and attended to queries very promptly in conclusion a very nice hotel i stayed in room   at checkout reception didn t ask if i had a good stay and i forgot to mention my complaint as i was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room   has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open i enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think   over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to    am in the morning i don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel nice breakfast large room good location for tubes sights etcno negative everything was very close few minutes walking and you were in the middle of everything the staff were very kind they would not let you go out in the rain without an umbrella was very clean room was huge beds super comfy food on point the doormen were very friendly and made you fell welcome was like a home away from home would highly recommend to everyone amazballs xoxo gossip girl nothing a comfortable room reasonably priced and close to all the southbank attractions a problem we had with a noisy aircon unit was sorted out extremely quickly queue at check in and flimsy frosted glass door on bathroom not sufficiently private for twin room very good location and quiet for city centre hotel better towels and more milk and sugar available in the room the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very clean the location was great for getting everywhere room for   people but serviced and adequate for   people only   double bed and   sofa instead of   separated bed excellent location very quiet rooms good quality rooms good value for money unfort we had a dreadful experience in the hotels italian eatery after waiting an hour got food the staff came to explain they had lost the order could we start again we were famished to start with the complimentary breadsticks did not really lift our dissapointment being able to glance toward the window and check the time looking at big bens tower handy for transport children our grandson made very welcome not a clean room bathroom floor tiles are broken and it s leaking in the shower cabin towels are not very clean it s not a white colour very old everything is near to the hotel the dining room was a little cold at the door end that didn t affect us as we were seated right by the servery but could have been uncomfortable for those at that end the suite was comfy and family friendly meal in restaurant was lovely doesn t have own car parking but there are places nearby great hotel chain ideal situation for access to city very helpful staff even after the stay when i arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning     times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about we also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at  am whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills it s such a shame because the location is excellent location was absolutely excellent nice city view which i paid extra for reception staff were friendly upgraded to an executive room price was a little high for what you get was told it was a quite room but you could still here guest above us breakfast was okay but could of been better bed was comfortable although a little small great location waterloo station just around the corner not a great deal of parking but we did find one that was about a   minute walk around the corner and only   for  hours i would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty otherwise it was a great stay we came down for a family member s birthday and this had clearly been noted on their system and she was greeted with birthday messages upon arrival the room was beautifully decorated and we were made to feel really welcome fabulous location and really quiet staff were so friendly and were genuinely interested in our plans and how our stay was i would definitely stay here again personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at     this morning when i happened to wake just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay i would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room i don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was   each we opted to take a   minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for   each well located and on the eye side of the city was as expected for a reasonably priced city hotel rooms clean and comfortable beds very comfortable with cosy feather pillows and duvets microwave and crockery in the room if you wanted to do some sort of mini self catering a little confusion over the room i booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room this just put the booking in doubt also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after i queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room it was the ambience and the weekend was a success restaurant has no spaghetti no garlic bread etc etc we were in a group of   and there was several dishes unavailable the desert was tiny wouldn t use the restaurant againno positive the breakfast was not good value for money i booked this for my daughter s birthday and the hotel went out of their way to make it a special day for her the pictures from online made it seem the room was bigger than actually was bathroom door i didn t like hi there the staff was friendly prompt on taking care of me restaurant quiet small very busy even at supposedly quiet times for breakfast we had to queue and wait for table as three of us staff tried hard to seat people asap city view was a view of the railway station not the view i expected good location pleasant staffno negative we were lucky enough to get a superb upgrade even without that we would have been impressed but that was a clincher what a view the photos say it all very convenient location definitely one of the best for access to central london very small breakfast room causing massive slow queues for breakfast long wait for lifts and house cleaning was poor when they turned up reasonable view every morning you have to stand in a line to get to the restourant for     minutes just to get your breakfast the windows are not opening in the room so there is no fresh air have problems with the safe box do not work and with the door to the room cant open need to call engenier location rainforest shower head dirty required cleaning before use alarm clock radio set to bst stay early january no instructions on how to reprogram excellent helpful staff the drench shower didn t work properly as holes blocked by lime scale so more of a drizzle however also had a normal shower attachment which worked fine being upgraded to a suite because it was my birthday with a complimentary bottle of wine fantastic breakfast no negative spacious room amazing view great location staff very happy to help and lovely extra touches made to the room for my mothers  th birthday all our booking requests were met with a lovely view of the london eye on a high floor great value for money for   of us in central london perhaps some recliners and relaxing chilling area in spa but this is in mo way a complaint i need to do a full review on tripadvisor the staff were amazing an upgrade bottle of wine left for our anniversary food really good a fabulous hotel and can t wait to go back the only thing was the washbasin tap that looked a little tired all of the staff were friendly and room   was excellent our evening meal in the italian restaurant was delicious the staff were poor on discovering a hair in my room service meal refused a refund of the whole meal just generally set up a bad scene for the remainder of the break away wanted to refund me the one meal i said the rest was ruined they came and collected all the food including the absolutely fine desserts before actioning a refund terribly backward way of customer service breakfast lots to choose from there was nothing i didn t like about hotel or our stay we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the london eye which was fantastic staff were lovely especially in the restaurant very friendly and helpful the central location meant that is is possible to walk everywhere if you feel inclined some language barrier with a member of staff as he didn t understand but overcome with help from his colleague beds very comfy and super helpful staff amazing location and great views as we were upgraded by compliment only that the hairdryer didn t work and i had to wait quite a while for someone to bring me another one so my hair was nearly dry and not sitting right i love the decor and that the hotel rooms are a good warm temperature on arrival the hotel is modern and sleek while still having a cozy feel and glow there was a strange howling noise that disturbed my sleep in the morning i think it was the wind through the vents the breakfast was good but a little over priced the location was perfect literally a   minute walk to the london eye and westminster bridge there was a car park that was just outside the hotel so extremely handy no negative the staff was extremely friendly it was my birthday so i got a room upgrade bottle of wine and a bday card and balloons in my room amazing location too no complaints very pleased with this hotel stayed there for my wife s birthday and they decorated the room for me with balloons and happy birthday message on the window plus a little card ment a lot was upgraded to a studio for free with veiw of london eye will stay here again ac and warm air needs to function better and be more user friendly i was upgraded fantastically to which i chose to stay an extra night views perfect cleanliness spot on honestly my wife and i were really looking for a room with a view on london eye and or the big ben plus we did not like the bathroom door style a bit transparent and openable from outside our little son has no boundaries no positive the shower wasn t very hot and the windows didn t open at all which for one night was manageable but for a longer stay would have been a problem as we like fresh air we were thrilled to find a reasonable rate at a central location and were even more pleased when we were upgraded for free we have a studio with kitchen and living space and hope to return with our son for a london weekend break thank you no negative location is fantastic short walk from waterloo station and very close to the london eye and the riverbank room was very clean and good size with impressive views of the shard and central london wifi signal television could be positioned in a better location location was very good and a very nice hotel staff all politie and helpful definitely want to stay here again later on in the year honestly the only thing i would say is not great is the expensive mark up on drinks in the bar i understand the overheads etc but even so its just a nice atmosphere in the hotel and i have stayed there on many occasion did not like the same breakfast menu every day people with long stay gets bored with eating same thing again n again you need to change the menu on alternate days the self laundry service is a saver for family with children and health club spa service is fantastic but quite expensive should make it bit economical no lock on bathroom toilet door glass door that slides not much of an issue staff were delightful the ability to alter the temperature of the room with ease was great and the rooms were comfortable the room was clean the shower worked well and was easy to use great location and great value for money amazing price no negative very friendly and attentive staff excellent food in the italian restaurant delivered hot and correctly cooked we were given a courtesy upgrade not expected which we very much appreciated i booked using this site and i admit it was a little last minute however my savings via the website weren t showing up on their systems and they were going to take the full price at first in my case they were quick to resolve the issue however it took much longer to resolve the same problem for my colleagues also their system tried to take money from my card even after i had paid for my whole stay be vigilant and check your card now and then during your stay the location was very central with good restaurants within walking distance and lots of tube stations nearby a bit chilly in the main areas because open plan is contiguous with the front doors to the hotel very nice locale well equipped comfortable but not spacious fitness center very convenient to waterloo station which connects to central london well went for larger room which had nice sitting area and worth the extra price no negative absolutely loved our stay staff couldn t have been more helpful and we were even upgraded to a penthouse suite free of charge highly recommendedno negative i loved our room it was very spacious nice decor we had a beautiful view of the london eye which looked great at night the staff were polite and friendly they made us feel welcome with little touches such as a birthday card for me and complimentary wine they also gave us a free upgrade on our room which was great the breakfast was good on both days we had it a good variety of different foods the room service meal was very poor a half toasted cheese sandwich with cold fries i asked for fresh brown bread way too expensive for the quality spacious room the bar staff didn t explain they automatically added a discretionary service charge to each drink i questioned the price because it was   pence more than in the menu the barman was not happy and showed this when i asked him to remove the charge service was slow and the bar staff were not engaged the bar was not busy at the time good location nice area easy walking distance to covent garden i felt the breakfast was expensive and there was a long line on sunday morning of people waiting to be seated however once seated the staff were extremely prompt and helpful great location friendly and helpful staff nothing to complain about love this hotel view of london eye was amazing stayed for my partners birthday and when we got in the room staff had left birthday cards and a happy birthday message on the window which was lovely the room was very spacious and clean bathroom had bath and shower staff were friendly would recommend staying here the only thing was the mattress on the sofa bed not thick enough great location for sightseeing south bank near underground for covent gardens theatre land lovely hotel great value for money would definitely use again would have to say thought the bar prices were a bit steep even for london nearly   for a juice room very quiet considering it was adjacent to the railway and a busy road my room was very comfortable and well equipped and it s very handy having a gym on site very close to many london attractions and travel connections not a bad experience but would suggest   armchairs in a double room would be handy instead of   especially if staying in room for a while and not wanting to lie on the bed this is really nit picking as room was very comfortable very close to waterloo as travelled from dorchester south for   day break rubbishy a c we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm i would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months appreciate that lower windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue location suite upgrade great staff and ease of check in not a bad experience at all just a minor quibble please replace tinned orange segments with real orange slices grapefruit at breakfast also suggest replacing mackerel with smoked salmon great location nice restaurant very comfy beds liked the ice maker on every floor really handy little kitchenette in the room good sound and light proofing great view over london breakfast was cold and   extra for my boyfriend to have eggs benedict meaning his breakfast cost   and he didn t eat off the buffet we got a free upgrade and the room was lovely staff very attentive the car park is very tight to park and their staff are rude and unhelpful although it was nothing to do with the hotel it was my wife s birthday the staff decorated the room with balloons and gave a complimentary bottle of wine and card although we don t drink it was a very sweet and thoughtful gesture small room sliding frosted glass bathroom door which didn t give much privacy when using the toilet contents of mini bar were too expensive breakfast at   a ahead is too expensive no natural light to room as window looked out to internal spaceno positive the fact that there was dirty stinky socks in a cupboard and view to the train station room was amazing and access to tv movies music our lil kitcen area too no negative issue with room a leak from above causing dripping in service cupboard staff attended straight away and moved me to another room so v happy with that no negative my boyfriend and i had a great stay i arranged the trip to celebrate his  th birthday when we arrived the staff on reception were very welcoming and we were told we had been upgraded for free the room was immaculately cleaned and all the facilities bathroom kitchenette television lighting were great we spent most of our time out of the room and exploring london but if we had wanted to spend more time relaxing in the room then it would have been extremely comfortable to do so the location was great a very short walk from the london eye and other attractions it took us about   minutes to get there from the hotel and close to waterloo station which was ideal for our arrival to and departure from london i would highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again on return trips to london staff has a poor level of english no bathrobe and slippers were provided tv and phones inside are very old paint coming off in some of the corners cleaners were knocking my door very early in the morning which was inconvenient overall poor value for money considering that i have paid   pounds for two nights location of the hotel and view were okay it was really busy and nosy so difficult to sleep if you are above the restaurant bar avoid rooms over the left side although they do have the best views it is very expensive even the food and drinks we ended up going out for everything perfect location close to so many things and well connected sliding glass door of the bathroom it doesn t fit the conception of park plaza in general needs something better excellent location for the purpose of our trip very convenient to walk around and discover the near by london eye westminster big ben jubilee bridge etc westminster and waterloo tube station are very close by warm and spacious suite the one thing i d say is if using the restaurant avoid the steak the location is perfect for sightseeing and transport services great staff and facilities poor checking in rooms tired wardrobe door didn t close no proper shower tray supposed to be suite with london eye view but could only see top of it and no skyline view location room was not cleaned until very late afternoon bathroom floor was very wet after using the shower as the shower screen was not adequate room also felt quite cool with no way of increasing the temperature excellent location for our visit to the new year fireworks good party in the bar afterwards good breakfast and thank you for the nice touches as i was also celebrating my birthday elevators at rush hour temperature and air not easy to regulate in internal rooms end of the year in london very good experience hotel was part of it quite expensive specially   dec dinner we would go back to this hotel but for a more reasonable price bar staff took forever to serve me and then was threatened with being thrown out when i complained customer service non existent manager apologized and gave me a bowl of fruit but by then the damage was done cleaning staff threw away medicine from my room safe did not work in my room paid nearly   pound for a room on new years eve and breakfast not included location was good went to a new years eve party which was good nothing worth mentioning the staff were all very pleasant courteous and helpful and made our stay extremely comfortable special mention to mr daniel north the duty manager for arranging our room with a spectacular view of the new year fireworks from the eye of london a memorable stay indeed in welcoming   breakfast items should change every so often staying there for   days the same breakfast items got old great location to get to attractions and underground friendly staff and had laundry facilities nothing great location close to the london eye and southbank easy to get around bus and underground stations were less than   minutes away room was spacious and extremely comfortable bathroom was really nice with a bathtub and a shower area kitchenette was well equipped and promptly cleaned by the house keeping staff each day staff was helpful had requested early check in and the room was ready when we arrived free left luggage facilities were available thus we could check out and go around even on the last day when our flight was late at night the stay was awful dirty room unhelpful staff and the room was too small for three people not worth the money and very disappointing there was nothing about this hotel that i liked the restaurant within the hotel had very slow service even when it wasn t particularly busy we had to ask the staff where the food was after waiting an hour when the food came it wasn t worth the wait friendly reception staff and very close to big attractions and local shops also a very nice cafe close by that i would recommend called barbarellas great for breakfast or lunch rooms too warm even with a c turned to cool disable accessible shower flooding the floor of ablutions esp arround toilet design of panel allowing water to run out of shower location and friendly staff very slow lifts lots of guests taking the stairs the room for a junior suite was a little tired location and nearby parking good in house italian restaurant spacious room well equipped no negative we were treated extremely well it was my wife s birthday and we were upgraded and the room was decorated after our last stay when it was our  th wedding anniversary and the occasion was ignored we could not have asked for anything more no negative i booked in for an anniversary the staff went all out to make our stay as special as possible putting us on the  th floor with the most amazing view of london lovely room clean and cosy i would defiantly return here great location internet tv was hopeless sound and picture were not in sync and no amount of rebooting etc would cure this the shower in the room had no edge to the shower tray meaning water went all over the bathroom floor hopeless design fault offered a high floor room and disappointed to discover it was internal with no views at all staff were excellent and location very convenient the double room was just a big single had to pay for expensive soya milk to use with complimentary tea and coffee drinks at bar very expensive extremely high sided bath made using the shower potentially dangerous location nothing we originally booked the executive suite but was upgraded to the penthouse suite free of charge had the most amazing view and could see all the way to wembley had to queue for breakfast on the saturday for quite awhile and was a bit hectic tables very close together good location very friendly and efficient staff hotel room good still think the price is a little high i did get a deal on my stay but still thought it a little expensive overall really like the location as its suits me for where i like to hang out etc i asked for three beds for three men and we were given only   beds one rolled over sofa which was extremely uncomfortable rusty taps in bedroom very loud aircondition even our executive room was tiny and we paid a lot of money for this discomfort location is very convenient standard rooms have indoor window view only executive rooms have outside view which is nice but pricey in floor one especially room number   it is very noisy and couldn t sleep at night because of the continuous noises coming from the service lifts one of the managers and some of the reception staff are very rude and impolite and i can add more details in this regard if you want i liked the cleanliness of the rooms and the hotel in general had to ask for sofa bed to be made up and extra towels although booked for   adults apartment style room excellent for extra space with disabled partner and privacy for adult extra guest to stay good accessibility for wheelchair user great view of the shard comfortable and quiet but   minutes from waterloo we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a studio with a view of the london eye it was  gbp per night but the view was obstructed and not worth the extra outlay in my opinion location is excellent walking you can get to westminster in   minutes with waterloo station just two minutes away some staff could not speak english very well especially the woman that checked us out cook had difficult time making eggs to order the location of the hotel was close to the main sights of londonno negative we had a lovely corner room on the top floor with a balcony offering fabulous views over london the room was spacious and well equipped the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good slow service in the bar early morning i wanted a coffee to go but simply didn t really want to serve opened a few cupboards looking for take away cups so i said i d leave it and i got one elsewhere great location nice staff at night light in wardrobe kept turning on even when doors are closed location of toilet paper had to twist and lean down and it strained my back room size and facilities in roman and hotel much further from train station than anticipated one say room was not cleaned completely but once discovered staff were speedy in rectifying situation staff were lovely and it was close to parliament hotel was a bit hot from check in to concierge keeping our bags bar staff comfy beds this hotel was perfect fantastic location right by the southbank we come once a year with the kids and will stay here again i don t like having to pay a service charge thats forced on me by the bill in the bar area i always tip anyway we did have our money taken twice for the room but this was explained on our arrival as a  rd party mistake problem was rectified competently on arrival by the duty manager and we were offered a free upgrade and complimentary drink which was nice breakfast was extra and far too expensive even for a london hotel great studio room with view of the eye and helpful staff spectrum bar was good for food and drink bar service at a glacial pace upgraded to a really lovely suite with great views over london location was great on the south bank next to westminster bridge we only had two issues on the last morning of our stay the hot water wasn t working in the shower disappointing also we had room service for breakfast but the order only   correct the rooms are loverly clean comfortable etc staff are very helpfull and polite the location in london is ideal for attractions and easy access to the tube station no negative upon booking i let the receptionist know what i was booking the room for my   year anniversary with my partner when we arrived the room was decorated fit for a king and queen with towel swans petals and a very sweet personal card signed by the staff who set up the room of which i have kept and resides in my bedroom extremely touched and happy with my second visit to the plaza even happier than my first visit as a celebration for my  st birthday shower room was a little small and the door opened inwards and brushed the edge of the toilet it was spotless and well equipped so i am being a little picky super room with a great view of the london eye attentive staff and a very comfortable bed the mattress on the sofa bed in the studio was filthy with at least five horrid blood stains the shower hose was leaking and the sink was dripping on to the scales stored under it needless to say the scales had long stopped working as a result as they were soaked in water location the studio the view nothing it was great we were upgraded to a room with an amazing view and given a bottle of wine free as it was my boyfriends birthday was a lovely gesture being a club carlson member and having upgraded the room on arrival for an additional   total of   to include breakfast and a view i would have expected more than a pair of slippers no dressing gowns only three tea bags only two tissues in box in bathroom and a duvet which only just covered the bed on arrival at breakfast we were told we had not pre paid and subsequently seated on a table totally surrounded by other tables guest bags etc so you weren t able to get out without inconveniencing people by asking them to move no explanation of how the buffet worked and no offer to top up tea this is a shame as we have stayed here on a number of occasions previously and experienced fantastic second service lovely hotel centrally located for travel in london fab view from upgraded additional payment room let down by small details as listed only one member of staff that we dealt with had english as their first language resulting in us struggling to understand them and them most certainly not understanding us we also found someone else s dried urine on the loo seat upon arrival we contacted housekeeping but they didn t understand us so it wasn t rectified until we had yo go to reception and complain the view from our upgraded room was fab breakfast are was very cramped and the food quality was below average sausages were not nice tasting fried egg had a hard yolk  nd bed in the room was a sofa bed very uncomfortable for     for one night also the air con only worked on one side of the room and the hotel was extremely hot everywhere we went not just in the room the decor and overall look was good did not like the  st room we were given however without too much trouble we were able to change to a nicer room the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired far too many people for such a small restaurant not enough room to enjoy breakfast leisurely location had to chase for room servicing day two and then not serviced very well decided to do it myself front desk friendly and very helpful location excellent the reception staff is not at all courteous after paying so much they need extra money for everything we asked for good view room they need extra money for it we asked for late check out they need extra money for it the hotel does not have a lobby for spending some time you sit in the caf and they want that we should order something so that they get money the rooms are so small i will not recommend this hotel to anybody the location is good that is it no negative the service we received was brilliant it was my partners birthday and we got treated amazingly well in particular a staff member called kasia who greeted us at the reception our executive studio was amazing with views of the london eye and big ben no negative fantastic room with outstanding views of the city the staff were extremely attentive and our room was spotless and comfy loads to choose from at breakfast which was served until  am great for a nice lay in would recommend to all nothing paulina from housekeeping made an amazing job cleaning all the room and bathroom truly made me felt home and comfortable bbig thank you to her small rooms with the inside ones having windows onto the atrium were strange overlooked by passage way on other side of the atrium and claustrophobic with curtains for privacy and no connection to daylight location excellent although not easy to find with   park plaza s almost next to each otherno negative customer relations was great to the girls at the front desk all the guys of concierge the room service crew the massage therapist at the spa and last but not least the incredible kim she was kind happy spirit and always had a smile on her face her compassion towards people was superb thumbs up to a great hotel glass door into bathroom short bath incomprehensible shower controls mystery phone rings in morning free upgrade to suite view of trains comfortable bed and pillows long queue for breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby location is excellent and the rooms were a decent size lots of privacy for anyone sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge area our flight arrived very early and the rooms were not ready we didn t expect them to be but staff organised access to the gym for an early shower which was great room not ready at  pm checked in at  pm no credit card was asked for at checkin caused a lot of issues when ordering drinks once into room we waited   hours while it was cleaned it was filthy dirt all over the bathroom nothingno negative we enjoyed our dinner in the hotel restaurant the location is very handy for westminster big ben and the houses of parliament the southbank of the river thames with its many restaurants cafes and waterloo station for connections to london underground and national rail services the alarm system was started at  am and we left the hotel to the evacuation point and we were asking the hotel stuff but every one gives us a a different reason then in the day after at  pm the alarm started again and then we left the hotel again but they told us it was a test test at  pm no positive no issues would recommend visit and stay to friends and others very convenient location perfect for our visit to london eye staff were very friendly and accommodating not overly priced for london with good quality food luggage drop off and collection was excellent the italian restaurant was a bit too low level with respect to the overall impression of the hotel inspite the chianti was superb the bar service was super lousy nice hotel very convenient and friendly service fire alarm was working   times the first one was at   am and the second was at  pm and they said it was test while they asked of evacuated and all the gust went to the evacuation point no positive breakfast is the same all monring i stayed   nights and every morning you had same things little bit boring but hotel is in the centre just behind the big ben we stayed here   times during our holiday and a couple of the rooms on the lower floors were a bit tired soap holders falling out of the wall fridges that didn t work etc great location also had guest laundry which is fabulous for those travelling for a few weeks no negative loved the fact that the hotel was so centrally situated each evening went back to a really comfortable room where we could relax and look out over london at night the minuses were athough they did not influence me to give a goog review is that the restaurant may not be so expensive but we had room service once had a basic pizza and it was horrible and it costed   the second situation was in the hotel bar when the waiter took our order we waited   minutes for a drink and again waited after he renturned for the second time the hotel is absolutely great when we arrived we were given a warm welcome from eloise the girl in the afternoon shift we were given a upgrade to the executive studio so we had a view on big ben and the parliament all the time the room was perfectly taken cared of when we were departuring we check out with tiffany who welcomed us again at the park plaza and again we shall stay here whenever we visit london we dropped our luggage off early which we were told is not a problem but when we checked in later we were told that our luggage had been taken to our room but had not it then took   calls to reception and a wait of    hr for it to arrive making us late for our evening meal location and cleanliness of the hotel is very good with easy access to the transport system and attractions the food is excellent with lots of choice and breakfast especially no negative all staff were friendly and helpful in all parts of the hotel we had to change our plans to eat out and switch to the hotel restaurant this was sorted with ease the hotel restaurant wasn t the most atmospheric but the food was lovely as was the service room very well eqipped and comfortable scrambled eggs at breakfast were actually the texture of creamy scrambled eggs almost unheard of for hotel breakfasts great location for south and central london for our visit the hotel was rather overcrowded because of half term long waits for the lifts and long queues for breakfast although we hoped for a view over the river we looked over waterloo station the room was very comfortable clean and quiet and well equipped with everything we needed no negative upon arrival was told we had been upgraded to the penthouse suite and as it was a birthday we had been given a card and bottle of wine aswell perfect touch to a nice weekend     wasn t given a good room room had no view or window to outside so was claustrophobic was charged twice so wasn t able to access my money i specifically bought for my trip no positive poor view from our room  nd floor to a car park bins sofa bed for kid should have a thicker mattress location next to bus and metro stations friendly staff kitchen in the room confortable double bed large bathroomno negative excellent service warm and well informed staff spacious and very comfortable room with outstanding views breakfast was tasty and the in service entertainment user friendly had resplendent stay the bed it was a little flat futon looking and not very comfortable the receptionist was very friendly i arrived about  pm to check in and he was most helpful upbeat smiley and made me feel welcome he actually gave me a free upgrade which was very nice of him i was only there on business and would be checking out   hours later at  am and the upgrade was an added perk i booked a family room for   adults   children ages     but on arrival i was given a standard superior double room with just   double bed   people on   bed was extremely uncomfortable having travelled for almost   hours prior to getting to the hotel around midnight i was simply top tired to complain however my family i were very disappointed no positive i dined in the restaurant the food and house wine were of poor quality the lasagne gave me indigestion all night and what was described as a cheesecake was a mousse on a biscuit base the d cor crude black and white paintings of famous italian scenes was appalling nice room but view of the station roof the staff is unfriendly and unhelpful not all of them but mark was so tough and unhelpful another lady caused me the problem of having another room reserved and paid without chick in she supposed to contact the reservation for me since morning and she did not do anything in more than   hours the guest manager did not help me as well and never apologise for inconvinience i was not waiting to refund my money but at least to give me my right to use the room anf to apologise come on they know nothing about communicating with customer their english is poor a man in the comcierge treated me like a he shouted in my face resusing to bring my luggage bcause he is too busy right now while i have not asked him to bring them immedietely i had then to bring them by my seld the blond gentelman in concierge was so friendly and polite and apologised to me for what his colleage did finally i would never go back to that hotel i paid more than   per night and staid for   nights the value for my money was zero i booked there because i was a loyal customer of park plaza westmenester bridge i like the view there and the value for money but with county hall it enjoyed the view only bed was not the most comfortable inside room so no natural daylight no disturbance from other rooms or the corridors good size room and bathroom friendly staff no view we looked right into the back of waterloo station but we were not in that much to look at the view so it was nt really important we did not have breakfast as it was very expensive which was a shame only a few minutes walk to london eye and southbank restaurants lovely room with lounge area and microwave facility very clean and everything we needed one of the staff blocked amount from the credit card as it is prepaid mastercard without asking that she will do that however i was planning to pay all amount in cash as well as she charged from the card deposit amount without informing us this is impolite and unethical way location rooms are clean and bigno negative staff were helpful well informed and took the time to answer questions in detail re travel time to allow etc the hotel was scrupulously clean smelling fresh the only thing wrong was the height of the bath tub as i am not very tall   ft   and i hurt myself getting in and out of the bath and has a result my legs has bruises on the front and back we loved the location and the attitude of the staff lovely people the room was fine no negative the hotel was amazing the room we had was lovely and clean beautiful view the staff was polite and helpful we paid extra to have the breakfast it was lovely room wasnt ready had to wait   mins was offered a free drink but only beer or wine we got a flat glass of prosecco expected better considering   for   night stay had to pay extra for breakfast   a head too location cleanliness frederica on reception was very friendly and efficient considering she was being let down by other members of staff no negative the staff were very nice there was a mistake with our room and since it was my boyfriends birthday they gave us an even better room with complimentary wine for both of us was really special i only stayed a night for the occasion wish i stayed longer noisy dark rooms fruits from breakfast spoiled personal didn t realy care the spa sauna and steam bath very small and dirty just no fun at all absolutely too expensive for what you get the hotel is good located london eye is near waterloo station with good connection to the underground room was small highly overpriced and noisy bathroom looked tiered and time for a change or refed not worth the price paid never again staff were mostly friendly and accommodating nothing the room and view the friendly greet at reception the complimentary bottle of wine and hand signed bday card for my misses the fact that the room had a great view really made our weekend i can t thank the lovely lady on reception ebough genuinely freindly and profesional room was small air con did not work poor check in breakfast luke warm damaged hair dryer replaced staff unsure of breakfast payment and aggressively interrupted our food terrible phone service when questioned by customer service location room a little small extremely high step to get into the bath shower good location close to train station warm welcoming staff concierge were very obliging and quick to assist with luggage to room and storing luggage on checkout no negative we were two friends sharing a superior twin but were upgraded to a penthouse lovely views and meant we could also have separate sleeping space using the bed settee we did have faulty air con light bulb and the bath was very slow to drain but reported and apart from the bulb was resolved housekeeping very efficient to make up sofa and arrange opening of patio doors while the room was good enough for our short visit its inside facing position would have been disappointing for a longer stay the location of the hotel is perfect as there is lots to do and see in the area the staff were warmly welcoming and efficient at check in and check out the room was fine for our visit which was only one night a world of difference between the outward city view facing room and the internal room with its futuristic lift and darkness ask for the city view when booking staff were fantastic location is brilliant nice touches for our birthday boy which was appreciated complimentary drinks voucher whilst waiting for our room was very much appreciated tables for breakfast are too close for every ones comfort a little too far from london underground stations to walk with suitcases a large lounge area would be great good staff good sized rooms great location for trips that we made very quiet considering traffic outside the     surcharge that is in the small print any tips should go to the staff and not back to the company coffers this is not fair and not clearly stated location the design and layout of the toilet make less sense since the flush button is behind the lavatory cover and the toilet paper rolls are quite inconvenient to reach but after all it is not a problem amazing location and view overly priced for a   star hotel even in good location   per person per night for breakfast location ideal for central london comfortable and spacious room all staff very pleasant issue with the room choice we paid extra for a city view got to our room to find a view of train station which wasn t pleasant complained at reception to get a response saying u can see the shard barely could she then went on to say they were nearly fully booked we still weren t happy so she spoke to the manager and he said we could upgrade and get a better view for just   which we weren t happy for as we had originally paid extra for a view that we never got to have to pay even more breakfast busy took forever to get a fried egg that someone stole our seats never got offered tea or coffee after asking someone for tea they brought over with no milk so had to ask again great location evening dining in the restaurant was lovely views were stunning once we had sorted the room situation out booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price no fridge it is only for extras location is perfect nice view spacious room shower and bath being italian i was very happy to find a nespresso machine as well to long to check in and the sounds coming up from the restaurant woke me and my friends up at  am saturday morning and sunday morning the radio was so pound that i thought that someone was having a party the spoiled the week end for us staff very helpful clean room was internal with no natural light and a windows overlooking restaurant fine for a night but no longer comfortable stay location perfect for the south bank and a short walk to trafalgar sq houses of parliament big ben etc didn t dislike anything but would be helpful to have more glasses in the room bar is ok but not a touch on park plaza westminster bridge next door thank you so much park plaza county hall it was my friend s birthday we arrived to find the room decorated balloons birthday card and all in an upgraded suite amazing on the first evening i asked for some more milk and sugar which i never received shower hose had leak making the water shoot off to the right stingy with the toiletries barely enough for two people room too hot air conditioning either not working properly or performing to its optimumno positive the breakfast was too expensive we were able to be moved immediately after asking after our shower broke and maintence had to be called however due to the inconvenience we were moved to the executive suite which was amazing staff were so kind i would definitely stay there again d staff also left a lovely surprise for my other half a birthday which was so kind couldnt find anything the staff at park plaza were second to none our group of   were celebrating a friends  th birthday and i had emailed ahead to ask of they could assign us a room with a view studio apartment upon our arrival we were given a lovely welcome our room had a great view of the london eye there was a card for the birthday girl even a happy birthday written on the window the room was clean and a good size for   breakfast was lovely plenty of choice friendly staff would thoroughly recommend this hotel did not dissapoint in any way staff were terrible on check in we arrived late and last minute so booked on bookings com beforehand when we arrived they said their system hadn t updated and we were then treated like an inconvenience despite showing booking references and confirmations one receptionist even pulled faces and thought it was funny more training of late night reception staff interestingly the trainee receptionist was actually the most personable of them all rooms very comfortable good location how cold it was in london i loved everything the staff was very nice and gave us a special birthday request everyone was extremely helpful and i loved the view of the london eye originally booked a room with twin beds for my granddaughter and me however the only window faced an interior wall no way to tell the weather so i had to change the accommodation i changed rooms paying a   pound supplement to have an outward facing room this room may have had the best view in london it was perfect so for an extra cost it made our trip to london sooooo much better the restaurant was also good value for dinner the cooling compartment to put our things was very small compared to the minibar in the room the location was near to all the places we wanted to visit and the neighbourhood is very nice breakfast was poor and i had to wait an hour with   kids to check in i artived an hour early before checking so went for food and came back an hour and   min later room still not ready had to sit in the bar for   min with me asking   times is room ready yet before being allowed to are room and spending money in bar that i didn t have we then had to rush as we had booked attachions and where going to miss them due to waiting for out room staff where lovely and friendly room lovely apart from the pull out bed was right in front of the door so a bit awkward to get around i ened up folding it away excellent location for family s going to attractions we were disappointed that breakfast wasn t included in the price of the room as considering the price was almost   per night also i was charged for   adults in the room when in fact there was only one adult and   children location of the hotel and safety when walking around city view was exactly how it was described staff was extremely slow to respond to requests for assistance sometimes taking them hours to fulfill a request   for   days in which i sat in a hotel room because i hurt my back assisting one of your employees get the curtains untangled from the balcony door location and roomno negative great location near the london eye waterloo underground station is a   minute walk from hotel the hotel was perfect for our group of three sharing a room the room was very spacious and clean the bathroom had both a shower and bathtub which was a bonus the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful i am an american so was very happy to find an ice machine when i first got there i had room with broken a c but when i called the reception they changed it for me right away i like the laundry room and the free wifi and the location about   min walk from the london eye and   min walk through the bridge to thr big bin if u are group of   make sure you take room number end with   like   or   these the one i had alot of room breakfast was chaos we waited forever for all cooked items and when bacon arrived it was so under cooked we ordered fried eggs but they only arrived as we left the table the que was huge even thou breakfast served till  am and we were there at    am in our room there was a big rip in the carpet which was very dangerous for my dad as he his legs are not to gd a c brill rooms lovely and cold location perfect the breakfast area is too small and the queue was unacceptable in such a lovely hotel the tea was weak and the hot food was only warm and on one occasion the mushrooms were cold the staff were very helpful but the breakfast system needs to be reviewed it was our mum s  th birthday and the hotel staff made a fuss of her they were lovely balloons and a card in the room plus a bottle of wine the sofa bed was hard and uncomfortable in the studio room i felt the breakfast should have been included in the price as it was quite a lot of money to pay the location was perfect for our needs the rooms were a good size plenty of room to move around and the beds were comfortable a medic was needed for a member of our party and the hotel staff were wonderful no negative excellent location and fantastic room on the  th floor super quiet which was great also organised a taxi for us to the airport taxi driver ahmed was a real star and comes highly recommended breakfast is good but way overpriced like most london hotels have to avoid rush hour times and can be quite noisy easy to park close by rooms well equipped comfy beds pleasant helpful desk staff the main bed was great the opened sofa terrible hard uneven small lucky for us the  cm male can sleep almost everywhere but this will not fit   persons or any type of a princess location is great nespresso machine in the room plus capsule great shower good air condition excellent gym it was all wonderful the staff were very polite and courteous and made us feel very welcome they wrote a happy birthday message on the window of our suite as it was my wife s  th birthday she was very touched by this couldn t check in until     expensive coffee whilst waiting for check in great position comfortable room well insulated from noise nespresso coffee machine a nice touch the floor to ceiling window meant there was no fresh air but the air conditioning was adjusted from the hotel norm to make it more comfortable for us the hotel was situated within walking distance of the london eye and other attractions yet the rooms themselves were quiet with no traffic or associated street noise the view of the city was great the italian restaurant had an affordable menu the apartment facilites were clean and adequate no negative the view from our penthouse room was amazing the location is perfect and we couldn t fault the hotel the staff were really friendly and made our three year old daughter welcome they give the children a passport with money tokens for them to spend at the bar the room was very clean and modern we loved our three night stay some of thw reception staff have communication issues and do not understand your requirements if you don t have to communicate with them it s a great stay the housekeeping and staff at the restaurant are excellent and work really hard the location of the hotel is superb as it is easily accessible from all major tourist attractions stayed in same room several months ago reported bed was lumpy and extremely uncomfortable obviously the same mattress still housekeeping was poor bits on floor lampshade still stained no bath robes location room very quiet staff friendly lovely birthday message etc i booked   executive suites and for the cost of these rooms we did not expect sofa beds also the rooms were very small and felt crowded easy fast check in the bathrooms were very nice being a muslim family we didn t find the breakfast buffet appropriate also the a c wasn t cooling well at night comfortable room in excellent location bathrooms clean but could do with a bit of tlc i like how easy it was to all attractions so close to london eye tube station the view was bad but it didn t bother me at all modern hotel the room is big the bathroom is big and goodno negative was a lovely comfy bed and they gave my daughter a birthday cake as we came london for her  th birthday nice clean room and lovely breakfast buffet breakfast is the only thing is fine the room was not clean the both tube cannot be used one of the twin bed was not comfortable no negative excellent staff including the chef at breakfast who was able to accommodate for a food intolerance fantastic room very clean comfortable beds our misinterpretation that there was a pool but this was next door in the adjacent park plaza hotel the views from our studios the room had no sweetner and very little milk for coffee s or tea for the time we were there the room price and view was great no negative absolutely wonderful staff was especially helpful on tips on how to get around london through the faster and cheapest routes loved everything no parking breakfast not included when we thought it was when we booked cost   pound per day for parking at nearest car park way too expensive next time i ll go with air bnb nothing special for the price was a good size room considering it s a london hotel room the first room they gave us was very small we had to upgrade which meant spending more money close to many of the london attractions our room wasn t ready when we went to check in the mini bar was dirty the design of the building and good breakfast no negative the staff was extremely helpful and the concierge was very patient we loved the room as well the taxi from the airport was expensive didn t have any mirrors in the penthouse suite just in the bathroom other than that it was the best place i ve stayed in london everything really needed a full length mirror all the amenities in the room the fridge coffee machine microwave dishes etc was like home from homeno negative i would like to thank the kindness of mrs rocio of the restaurant and manuel of the bar they was very polite and nice slow check out due to it problem gristle in sausages at breakfast misleading hotel name comfortable junior suite with views of london eye nothing very childfriendly and helpful staff the children felt very welcome and said that people in london are much nicer than in sweden the main door rotating is awful spacious rooms excellent staff good breakfast and working wifi overall we enjoyed the stay at the great location the bath tap was broken and leaked

to the top floor a large room with a view of big ben the bathroom door is semi transparent it s a door that can be opened easily you can hear and see the person inside location staff courtesy i felt that the cost of the breakfast was excessive especially when you compare it to somewhere like premier inn couldn t fault our stay i only had time for one nights stay i got upgraded for free to a penthouse thanks free wifi and midday checkout was a plus couldn t really fault it we were fortunate enough to be given a room up grade the room was excellent and well appointed very comfortable was

have done with more of them i found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful and it was very good value bath has wide side so difficult for an older or short person to get in to and out of comfy bed good breakfast will stay again breakfast is too crowded and not very nice also the bar was very cold because of opening doors the location is great the staff is really friendly room was set up for

quiet room nothing to much trouble for staff the bed needs a better mattress the quality was not there for the price of the room that was paid the location is excellent the food at breakfast also our room was not looked at until     at which time we were back in it position bar and meal prices bit expensive all staff from the front of house to the cleaning staff all very polite and extremely helpful the fish and chip ordered to room services not value for money four chips the hotel was lovely great location staff really helpful very long queue for breakfast and breakfast room was smaller than expected we were upgraded due to husbands birthday nice touches in room thought the staff should be a bit happy and more helpful and not worrying if they get tipped or not the location was great nice atmosphere one of the bar staff was very rude if you don t like your job customers then do not come in to work no positiveno negative lovely hotel great location and great price lots of staff around all if whom were vert pleasant and helpful what s not to likeno negative i liked the fact that our grown up daughter could comfortably stay with us without having to pay for another room the breakfast was really over priced for what it was we also didnt receive all of what we had asked for the room was absolutely beautiful a day after using express check out i still haven t received a copy of the bill friendly staff handy for westminster and waterloo too expensive for the quality and comfort not different to premier inn rather go to premier inn instead location wise but lack of car parkingno negative was upmost grateful for not just one upgraded room but all three rooms check in was a pleasant experinece and all the staff were too location to london tube and bus is not so convenient it is also not convenient for calling uber cars the bed is comfortable and staff friendlyno negative great hotel for a good price in london service accommodation and location excellent the staff is really nice with the hosts asked for   rooms next to each other before booking due to   children under   yrs not available when we got thereno positive booked a twin room was given a double room they did change but should not of happened location and feel of the hotel the spa was very disappointing just   cheap beds round the pool nowhere else to sit the treatments weee nice but not good value for money the room was pleasant and the bar area niceno negative we stayed here on our wedding night and the staff were incredible they treated us with such warmth and really made it feel special the room was wonderful and the breakfast delicious what really made it were the staff who were incredible recommended the shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything the great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though the hotel is very conveniently located to the theatres and covent garden the room was well insulated and the bed was very comfy so much so i slept through a thunder storm tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them i feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger the staff were so welcoming and the little touches in our room like the rose petals and electric candles by our bath made our stay extra special the pillows were a dream to sleep on considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed the furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned you can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom all in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about would definetly choose another hotel in london next time first thing we got an upgrade from a room to a suite which was very nice staff was helpful real beautiful bar with terrific looking bar menu cocktails a lot of attractions of london in walking distance the really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud i was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms wonderful staff so switched on and so genuinely helpful and concerned about pleasing guests although i have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top there really was more food than anyone could sensibly require my niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big the staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat the staff were all very friendly and attentive the food was superb my   year old great nephew could barely believe the breakfast enough food to feed an army served by a waitress who deserves special commendation very professional cheerful and obliging the porters were also all very helpful the lobby bar is well worth a visit the hotel is within easy reach of many of the west end theatres and other attractions i understand that room rates are high in this part of london and that one aldwych is a very high standard hotel with  hr room service but i felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices however the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices high level of service and comfort throughout the hotel having to leave wish we could of stayed longer all staff was so helpful to make our stay a memorable one from organising a special birthday treat in the room for my daughter to personally taking us to the taxis every time we needed one the rooms beds were so comfortable with everything you need hotel is right next to the theatre which with children is great after the evening show being able to walk back no negative great small luxury hotel good size well equipped rooms excellent location for central london on the strand near the thames and close to covent garden spa nothing wonderful hotel in an excellent location rooms are well furnished and comfortable with tea coffee facilities iron etc supplied on request the hotel also has a great gym and pool area the staff are without doubt some of the best we ve encountered in the hotels we ve stayed at very professional helpful and friendly cocktails in the lobby bar are fantastic if a little pricy we dined one evening at the eneko restaurant in the hotel basement which is very highly recommended fab food ambience i think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it the hotel location is perfect for a weekend getaway walking around covent garden and getting in an evening show the hotel is very stylish the staff were extremely helpful friendly and professional the bed was very comfortable and the room temperature perfect the breakfast was delicious no negative appreciated the customer service and attention to detail with the service all staff were friendly and professional the bar very smart is a welcoming comfortable place at the end of a long day in london sightseeing celebrating especially for for a late night drink snack noisy kids in pool meant i didn t go in but it was easter so to be expected i guess gorgeous sink in pillows on the bed door staff always friendly and welcoming steam room super hot which was wonderful nothing to dislike the rooms are as you would expect in a   hotel beds comfortable bathrooms are fine the location is fantastic covent garden literally around the corner right next door to the lion king and mumma mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better we went with a group of   to celebrate our daughter s  th birthday from the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful we received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group the bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to   wardour street which i would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly the doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our   year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free all in all one aldwych is now our favourite london hotel and that is really down to the staff and location they also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options thank you so much for making our daughter s big day so lovely no negative the room attendants attention to detail was excellent and we were impressed with the small touches like the fresh fruit the advisory notes left the tea tray with the fresh flowers etc room very small wardrobe access in particular small shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over   years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive the lounge facilities for residents is limited a very warm greeting on arrival and everything very well explained all the staff were lovely and very friendly the room was well equipped and spotlessly clean very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful bathroom toiletries very good fluffy towels and a good size complementary newspaper water and tea making equipment nice quiet room outdated room design much nicer in pictures than real life was very disappointed expected it to be nicer for a   star hotel loud plumbing noises in bathroom after use of water great location and very friendly staff the bed was too hard thats all staff very polite and helpful stylish decor very clean quiet despite busy roads not too big restaurant served lovely food for dinner and breakfast no negative the hotel provides outstanding service and is in the heart of the theatre district and just steps from the savoy hotel covent garden martket and a bridge to the west bank with all its food carts excellent restaurants surround the hotel and the hotel itself houses outstanding restaurants and a bar with novalty drinks served until midnight for what iv paid   for   night didnt even gt a breakfast we could av been told that thers a safe in room the chair in   was disgustig filthy wasnt very impressed with the serviceno positive incredibly noisy miniscule bedroom broken toilet water issue plumber finally fixed it at  am key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar receptionist in the morning a complete robot knew we d had a terribly night instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night i commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes i heard for   night and   glass of fizz i don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do i expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers eggs benedict breakfast was awesome pool amazing no negative we loved the charlie and the chocolate factory tea it was the perfect girl s afternoon out during a celebratory weekend the staff was incredibly helpful and made us feel very welcome the concierge arranged for two fun tours that we thoroughly enjoyed the lobby bar was delightful our room was quiet and very comfortable the location couldn t be beat with a short walk to covent garden the theatres the thames and many restaurants we will definitely be back the breakfast was not up to the level of the rest of the experience at this hotel expensive and not tasty slow service location perfect bed a dream staff outstanding loved the fruit cookies small cakes left in our room each night the box at the front door of the room for the papers each morning was a nice touch no negative there was special attention regards to the celebration of my husbands  th birthday with a bottle of champagne and amazing chocolate cake in our room i booked five nights and each night i was charged a different rate i booked my stay through booking com although the booking site mentioned a daily rate i was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me   different rates i wonder who s responsible for this lapse hotel or the booking engine ota very friendly and carering staff they make you feel like you want to come back over and over again the walk in shower was pretty tiny the location is perfect the staff warm friendly and accommodating the rooms are lovely with little surprises delivered daily by the staff high tea is a treat and the lobby bar is upscale and lively this is definitely my favorite uk property leaving probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in staff were excellent and very helpful from the doormen to the front of house staff the champagne and cake for a birthday treat was a very pleasant surprise breakfast to order not ideal for young children even part buffet would help film projection in pool great idea but unfortunately you can t really see it bar area and cocktails and swimming pool for our toddler toilet blocked and drains noisy would have preferred a walk in shower as rim of bath far too high for short person to step into absolute perfection the staff were all attentive and well trained they could not have been better the staff were a little over attentive although very polite at lunch i felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every  mins the spa and pool were lovely especially being in central london afternoon tea charlie and the chocolate factory selection was delightful size of room and bathroom were very spacious i would definitely stay again pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure the bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol the hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience the pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel staff were very friendly prompt check in good turn down service etc good location close to river and covent garden our room was spacious clean and very quiet nice touches in the room like free champagne for our anniversary reception responded promptly to all my emails prior to arrival we arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and i specifically wanted and booked twin beds the lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative car to airport did not arrive agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least   minutes prior to getting into a cab i personally checked on the car about   minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which i found unusual for great britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there i felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask   minutes later hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility we had the specific pleasure of having a wonderful concierge agostinho he went out of his way to do anything he could for us he helped book and hand pick theater seats for us for   plays arrange a trip to the cotswolds and just in general gave us tips on places to eat and where to go with very specific directions no wow factor and there was one waiter that did all the things you shouldn t do as a waiter at breakfast leaning across you etc loved afternoon tea the location it did take   attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds they need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card i did get confused the after noon high tea and having the beds turned down at night after a busy day great room service of food which was beautifully presented fresh flowers in room and real orchid plants every were room was quite small for a luxury double and the bathroom was quite basic with small single wash basin and basic small glass enclosed shower very comfortable bed quiet room very pleasant open bar area the water saving toilet flush is very loud in the middle of the night but better for the environment extremely polite warm staff we have stayed before but they made us feel like regulars actual bedroom was a little small but to be fair it had all the necessary resources staff excellent location really good they went the extra mile to provide child friendly equipment to have been offered the   for   nights offer by the hotel which we were unaware of as we would loved to have stayed another night staff couldn t be freindlier and do enough for you but remained professional at all times booked a private function for   of us ages ranged from     the catering and events dept were faultless perfect location for soho covent garden and theatre land no negative the staff kindly let me and my family have a     departure which was appreciated the hotel bedroom was very quiet which was wonderful the night porter mark was charming no negative the staff we re amazing and went beyond the call of duty my daughter and i were made to feel welcome and taken care of the room was clean and well laid out attention to detail was superb no negative best location for covent garden theatres restaurants and the south bank and its attractions are a short walk away i ve never slept so well the beds are great willy wonka afternoon tea a must all the staff are helpful and friendly will defiantly be back a possible inconvenience for business travellers is that the in room safe is not large enough for a laptop the is a lot to like at one aldwych the room was large comfortable and well appointed the staff are corteous helpful efficient and cheerful the private lounge available to guests for use after check out is a nice touch that in our case made a late evening flight much more relaxing there were many small touches too many to mention here that added to an aleady excellent atmoshpere and the location is excellent no negative this was the perfect hotel for a night away in the city room was well designed staff were fantastic attentive friendly and helpful but not over the top and remembered our names each time they spoke to us great location and lovely residents lounge the cocktails were delicious and we felt we were in the buzz of things without the hassle fantastic the foyer bar was lovely but gets very busy no where else as a guest to go and chill out if full fantastic location comfortable and good size room quiet despite being in the centre of london small grumble we had the afternoon tea however there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the baftas so we had to eat in the general dining area i think we should have been told that when we booked then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners no one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there for a special occasion this will always be my first choice in london ideally placed for shows or covent garden excellent service lovely lobby bar for drinks my wife had a poor cut of meat when in the restaurant but when we advised the staff the whole issue was handled very well everything about stay was excellent staff accommodation location and overall facilities first class we ve now found a base for our visits to london nothing   aldwych in my opinion is perfect the room was lovely with a view looking on to the lyceum theatre lobby bar made fabulous cocktails lavender cloud in particular staff were lovely love this hotel and cant wait to go back againno negative can t recommend this place enough and i visit london every month fantastic friendly professional staff impeccable service nice quiet rooms comfortable beds room service was quick and good bar is perfect for a work coffee or an evening cocktail there were lots of nice touches from the call just after arrival to ask if there was anything else the hotel could do or provide to water at turndown to the ziplock bag which appeared in the bathroom the night before checkout the pool is lovely no chlorine and just the right temperature but above all it s the staff one of the best run hotels i ve ever seen from the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for   mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after   mins table still sitting empty will never return location great for the theatreno negative from the minute we stepped into the hotel we were transported into another world the ambiance the staff the whole atmosphere was excellent and nothing was too much trouble we were treated like royalty and did not want to leave thank you everyone one little point i had for milk for my tea every day of a   night stay fabulously comfortable bed nothing too much trouble for the staff reasonably sized room for london no bad experience but surely this quality of hotel should provide complimentary tea coffee water in rooms on arrival good location very helpful staff lovely old building bedroom very comfortable no negative the concierge services and the staff generally are extremely helpful and professional they were able to get us best seats it s a great place to bring teenagers and the viewnof the bridge from the room is magical i say this after every visit but please put tea and coffee making facilities in every room and an iron very cheap b and bs do this so why not an exclusive hotel excellent staff and service lovely rooms and excellent food in indigo not much choice of food on the room service menu would have liked hot chocolate in addition to tea and coffee in room lovely staff good atmosphere nice room we were well looked after room quite small tv faced   degrees to the bed so no possibility of watching it wardrobe light would not go off bathroom very noisy when other floors used their needed better soundproofing in the bathroom bedroom was fine excellent location nice bar great staff the serving of the breakfast took a long time the dining room was very cold air condition the friendly staff at the bar front desk concierge houskeeping they were all excellent very professional no negative this is my favorite hotel in the world and it still is i wrote the manager a good letter especially about his great staff but for some reason it could not be delivered please tell him because i name names and want them rewarded no negative based in the heart of london with everything on your doorstep warm friendly and welcoming staff that make your stay truly pleasurable the twin beds couldn t be separated may as well have shared a bed with my business partner bang olufsen soundbox in the room for a five star hotel charging   a night for a room at the very least there should be coffee and tea making facilitiesno positive the room was quite small and nothing special for   a night the hotel is beautiful and the flowers in the lobby are amazing staff tries to be nice and some are but over all feeling of hotel was disapointing for the price location is really good the lounge area is a bit small side and therefore gets busy quickly other than that the place is excellent the atmosphere staff and service no negative hotel was excellent the amenities and location couldnt have been better the lobby bar and staff were superb nothing was too much trouble paying   for one night not including breakfast so in total   the staff were friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for us the bar was too busy to serve us on saturday evening location pool leisure facilities and the massage that my wife received all excellent for the same cost i had a much smaller adjoining room than my daughter in law and granddaughter and for that reason i felt i should have paid less no positiveno negative great location for west end and covent garden excellent welcoming staff and very comfortable i feel at home when i come here restaurant and bar closed sunday evening not informed in the website water in the room first night only why do hotels charge a lot for the room then not leave water complimentary in the room we were told to walk to the shop at   pm for water excellent location wifi was very weak i was able to get it on my laptop computer but could not get connection on my ipad or iphone staff was incredible everyone at front desk extremely helpful and friendly they could not do enough each day i returned i felt like i had come home based on research i asked for a high floor with partial view of arc de triumphe i got exactly what i asked for room large especially for a city like paris bright with a balcony that had the view to the arc amenities in room were everything you would hope for large and well lit bath metro a   minute walk bus to both airports just across the street no negative our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff we got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice this was our first time in paris and we loved it farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had would definitely recommend it nothing we had an amazing stay the rooms are very cozy with an amazing view of the arc de triumph i felt like home my entire stay staff was nice all the time would definitely stay again at this amazing little hotel no negative the staff and location of this hotel were great the hotel is located very conveniently near the arc de triomphe and the entrance to the metro underground it was very easy to access my office at la defence all the resturants and shopping as well as all the tourist sites and it also had a great view from the balcony no negative the room with the view was just fantastic very confortable cozy and clean amazing balcony where you just wanna stay whole day comfortable bed very polite and helpful staff nothing no faults at all brilliant location staff were very helpful and the view from the room was excellent would definitely visit again and highly recommend nothing very helpful i got engaged and they helped in every way they could had roses in the room and rose petals on the bed and they made the occasion perfect couldn t ask for more perfect location and views no negative rooms were a really nice size excellent location nicely decorated the hotel reception staff were so friendly and helpful really appreciated this as it was our first time in paris would definitely stay here again the bed is supposed to be king size and actually it is very small and uncomfortable too much nose because of contraction that they did not warned me about it which they should inform me once i booked the staff are very rude you asked them for a missing item in the room kleenex towel toothbrush etc they had an attitude the location is excellentno negative the hotel location was great the hotel room was excellent and i can say that it can be compared to   stars hotels the room was always clean with beautiful views the lifts are a bit small so big suitcases might be a problem the view was absolutely amazing very nice and cozy room perfect location at the arc de triomphe and champs elysees right in front of the metro no negative beautiful room friendly staff and an amazing view of the arc de triomphe well placed for attractions in paris close to the metro and within walking distance of the eiffel tower no negative excellent hotel wonderful staff very convenient location as it s right on top of literally a metro via lift definitely worth getting the arc de triomphe view staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat missing a bar or place for a drink limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the high street champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced   for a simple coke but this is a more paris issue in general perhaps clean rooms no noise even when so close to the main street excellent balcony with a super view  th floor nicely decorated safe everything you need for a perfect stay close to the metro station and this line brings you to all good places can t think of anything we didn t like we had a beautiful room for three on the six floor with a full view of the arc de triumphe and a partial view of the eiffel tower every detail was lovely newly decorated i believe and tastefully done in soft colors it was a pleasure to stay at this hotel no negative had a one night stay at this hotel and have nothing but praise for this hotel be sure to get superior room that has fantastic view on arc de triomphe and enjoy your morning coffee routine or wine evenings on terrace overall room was clean and cosy and very quiet and comfortable for good night rest hotel staff was very courteous informative and helpful i ll definitely stay here again and make sure it is more then one night the wifi was extremely poor there are a limited number of logins allowed shared across the entire hotel you would have to keep refreshing the login page and hope that someone logged out of the wifi or turned it off so that you could get connected the chief concierge farooq was extremely helpful with all our luggages it was of walking distance to the champs elysees and generally not difficult to find for taxi drivers the cafe across the road was also pleasant and does good cheeseburgers there are not many facilities like swimming pool or gym and the different areas are very smal like the breakfast room the lobby or the bar not hot food for breakfast very comfortable clean refurbished and great location the breakfast was too expensive and   euros meant that i never got to try the breakfast the staff were sooooo friendly i am a young woman who stayed alone during a business trip and i felt very safe and welcome all good but if the breakfast was included it would have been perfect the room was very good on  rd floor and balcony view of the arch fab location great helpful staff breakfast expensive wifi was not working for half of my   day stay fantastic location and staff this property owner is involved and attends to detail it shows up with the clean and well maintained property along with his staff s attention to the guests the breakfast hot breakfast items need to be refreshed more often eg at   the bacon was crispy excellent value for money room very clean quite and had a great view we stayed on the  th floor would definitely stay there again and recommend t anyone bed too small for a double way over charging during the euro   championship but i guess all other hotels in paris where doing the same next to arc de triomphe with beautiful view well run and maintained hotel elegantly finished no negative could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in paris in terms of location it doesn t get any better than this if you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all arc de triomphe we did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately the rooms are large by european standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view friendly and courteous staff added to our stay a special mention of mr farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas thank you splendid etoile you truly made our stay splendid no negative this hotel was in an excellent location just a minute or two to charles de gaulle metro station from where you could catch a train to any location in paris rooms were beautiful and staff were super friendly and helpful and all spoke excellent english would highly recommend this hotel breakfast not included cleaning lady frequently ignored do not disturb sign even though we complained about it at the front desk excellent location great staffno negative the staff were very friendly and helpful my room balcony had a beautiful view of the arc de triumph and the beautiful surrounding leafy streets the hotel is directly opposite a major metro station right near the arc de triumph and champs lys es restaurants and a little supermarket fantastic location staff member being loudly told off by lady manageress i assume she was right but not in front of client never do that saturday evening at  pm left outside of hotel door locked desk unmanned not good location location location quiet room mostly do to double windows bf ok no negative fantastic location by the arc de triumph and opposite the top of the champs elysees with a metro station and airport transfer bus stop right outside the front of the hotel incredible views from the balcony very helpful staff the bed was a bit hard but that s probably personal preference very friendly staff lovely room good size good location great view from our balcony no negative very nice hotel everything was excellent staff was welcoming the view was amazing the balcony was the best part with a view of the arc and eiffel tower the room was big comparing to other hotels in paris defiantly going back again the room photos on the website do not entirely correspond to reality because only newly renovated rooms are shown but we received an older room although very clan excellent location easy access to metro main tourist attractions nice central yet quiet neighborhood very friendly personnel much attention to cleanliness very comfortable beds coffee toiletries available overall i would recommend this hotel cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel the room was so small very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the a c because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it very friendly staff location was not bad the view was great they allowed us to check in very early the breakfast was really expensive   per person the staff was really really helpful recommended us where to eat how to travel around paris etc we are travelling in a group of   people with many large luggages at first we decided to go the cdg airport by rer cos if we take the taxi we would have to take   taxis then it will cost a lot but the staff arranged us a minivan taxi to take us all together it was very convenient loud nights during the weekends people screaming shouting from nearby bars the small balcony overlooking the arch and the metro station which is right outside the hotel entrance the wines provided are terrible and expensive   for half bottle we were very disappointed specially because france is famous for good wine we opened   bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible we were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it location is amazing very close to champs elysees staff were so friendly and helpful doing everything to please us and our little dog we were upgrade from classic room to superior room what made our trip much more special the room balcony view is spectacular we had such a wonderful time that we decided to stay an extra night no negative the location was perfect right outside the rer and metro walking distance from the arc de triomphe and the air france shuttle bus the hotel staff found out that we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room throughout the stay they were very helpful helped us print tickets quick to bring up requests like towels pillows and glasses and gave directions and suggestions for tourist to do s in paris the rooms are a bit small but it s an average size for european hotel rooms they also look exactly the same as the pictures advertised on the site overall a great place to stay in paris highly recommend it the beds was little uncomfortable location was exillant staff was very nice they offer me upgrade to a privallage room with balcony arc view specially mr farouq at the reception was very helpful and polite also he talks different languages he gave us a great help the hotel is nice and highly recommended breakfast was great specially the madlien cakes baked fresh and taste perfect sure will be back again leaving i would say the best hotel we have stayed in and we travel a lot i like watching hotel impossible and this hotel passed all the tests with flying colors super clean i felt right at home this was the first hotel i went in the shower with bare feet the staff is simply   stars from housekeeping room service and of course the front desk staff just amazing thank you all best location too we shall return no negative we stayed in a room with a view of the arc it was exceptionally nice all staff were helpful and made things easy the location is superb would definitely recommend cannot flaw anything no negative staff were extra helpful loacation was fantastic veiw from balcony was exceptional stayed in paris before and expected the rooms to be a lot smaller and was pleasently surprised on how spacious this hotel room and bathroom were would deffo return to this hotel change the carpet in the halls for wooden floor please fantastic location for shopping and to be reached early by metro from major trains stations friendly front desk staff clean and freshly renovated bath rooms no privacy there s no lock on the door so we couldn t lock it the house keeping staff entered the room while we were sleeping and we got panic elevators are pretty small the location is perfect food is good cleannessno negative exceptional hotel with incredibly attentive staff in a beautiful location we had a wonderful break and will absolutely stay here again when we return to paris the lobby smell and the redecoration during our stay small lobby with no space and facilities helpful staff specially mr farouq at the receiption and the hotel location one receptionist did not speak english and made it difficult to communicate requests all other employees were very helpful and accommodating i was accommodated with an early check in and provided a room on a higher floor as requested no negative comfortable location most of the landmark around there rer elevator is in front of the hotel most of the bus lines are near hotel i have been there   nights it seems to be wifi however didn t work for all   nights i told the stuff for this comment no positive the medal of key was heavy it will be better if they substitute keys with cards staff are very kind location of the hotel is very goodno negative concierge mr farouk was extremely helpful the room was a bit small from what we are used to but it s paris very clean and proffesional staff no negative rooms were pretty neat and well maintained supermarket just   mins walk nice cafes nearby just next to arc de triompheno negative hotel was in a perfect location for us close to lots of the paris attractions metro station just across the street no negative the location was very good and staff very friendly and polite hotel very clean and high standards very good for value of moneyno negative it is in a very good location in paris everthing is closed by metro and taxis shopping roads staff were friendly and very clean rare for one of my posts but no faults zero the perfect stay best place to see the flypast of bastille day stunning hotel i can t find any faults this is the third time we stayed at this hotel it is simply great perfect location and the staff is lovely definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting paris this time i was traveling as family and they gave us a lovely family room on the  th floor the view was absolutely superb there were no outlets in the bathroom police sirens were loud at night but weren t frequent very quiet otherwise don t use the elevator if you re claustrophobic we squished   adults and a   lb child but more as a challenge location surpassed expectations very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful large window to open almost like a patio which overlooked the cool old neighborhood wonderful breeze as i laid in bed no screen but no bugs i think we had a tiny glimpse of the eiffel tower from the window the tiny elevator was actually really fun for my daughter the tub was great the staff were incredibly nice they even helped me to my uber which wasn t necessary and made sure he was taking me to the right place the proximity to the wonderful luxembourg gardens was heavenly everything was great the view was amazing the hotel is wonderful and the breakfast was great already planning our visit back thank you for the best stay in paris bath towels are the size of a face towel for an american hotel i would have thought that they would have had bath towels fits for the average american i am not american who are rather larger than the average european location good for the rer b for both airports no negative the hotel was in a brilliant location the staff were very nice and welcoming and the rooms were quite comfortable and cosy would definitely recommend staying here when visiting paris very small thing i m short the side of the tub shower combo was a bit tall to climb over the staff are extremely friendly helpful there are nice extras in the room like robes with slippers a mini fridge the location is exceptional right in the heart of the latin quarter st germain des pres neighborhoods beds were very comfortable the air conditioning worked like a charm nothing location very quiet street but only a stone throw away from bars and restaurants nice modern room very clean friendly and helpful reception staff who all spoke excellent english slightly slow internet location was awesome breakfast was good the rooms are a little small but are much nicer than others i have been in in paris lovely lobby area the air conditioner stopped working but the staff were very apologetic and gave us a fan for our room and a complimentary breakfast the staff were great very friendly and helpful the hotel is in a great location and our room had a view of the eiffel tower loved it no mini bar no slippers no toothbrush a bit disappointing for a   stars hotel very well located in between st michel and luxembourg staff was nice and smilingno negative very convenient and cosy hotel close to some of the nicest places of paris the view from the room is amazing from eiffel tower to montmartre and notre dame the staff is helpful to have a nice stay in paris the place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway friendly staff excellent location furnishings a bit aged but not below expections the room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow for example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there but they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go   or   blocks the location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help the breakfast had more items than i expected for example i don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea to my surprise they had both regular yogurt and greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the eiffel tower that was a totally unexpected treat although i also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small it could barely fit   person i don t know how the bellman got our   suitcases and   rolling carryons into it i imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor  th nothing location was just excellent staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for paris really very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting paris again not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore fantastic hotel near the sorbonne on the paris left bank close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone our room was a decent size and very comfortable the hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated our room faced the street but at night it was quiet there are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff the elevator is small the environment around is great a v lib station is in front of the hotel it takes about   minutes to go to cath drale norte dame de paris by walking there are some asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss udon with hot soups no negative nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator the breakfast buffet was good the cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice my daughter especially liked the pc and the candies in the reception area no negative the location is very convenient but quiet my husband and i were traveling with our adult daughter and were able to book a connecting room for her she had a completely separate room but we did not have to pay double the price of one room the rooms were large by european standards elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building we managed ok wonderful staffs beautiful breakfast room and foods elegantly displayed and served gracious hospitality overall convenient location for public transportation the housekeeping was a little flaky face towel disappeared and never returned milk wasn t topped up room was small but parisian hotels usually are double glazing would be good despite being on  th floor there was noticeable street noise we had a really good deal on the price i do not know if i would have been so happy paying full price excellent location and comfortable hotel very pleasant staff     minutes walk to isle de la cite and about     walk to the metro plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby i really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating my room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room i saw no drinking water in the room or fridge staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day before my check out like i was a thief or something similar and i felt very uncomfortable about this i travel for work every week and i have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time i felt this way the location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper just location shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time i took a shower asked about a room upgrade with balcony the staff offered a great upgrade for   euros more it had a view of the eiffel tower gorgeous limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit great location for pantheon and shopping breakfast costs   euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway very good location safe and quiet in latin quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and rer directly to the airport and late afternoon i can always have a recess at the bueatiful luxembourg park around the corner plenty of nice and affordable local and asian restaurants i like especially au p re louis and sushiyaki i stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day this area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service my room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day i saw sunset on effel tower and it was amazing room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch bed comfortable staff very friendly location super early breakfast in the room is very convenient when you are in a hurry like i was all great for me thanks the staff could not have been more obliging i arrived direct from australia was seriously unwell they are definitely worth more than     for sevice no shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested we had requested a quiet room the room we had   was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors it meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants luckily they were not too noisy people it should not have been allocated to us if they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window we like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in paris room is small but is normal in paris facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works great location staff was friendly and helpful we were told we got upgraded on arrival to the eiffel tower view room wow great in we go into the smallest elevator ever  people max to the top floor the room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the eiffel tower for what that was worth what they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing i mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor crazy we informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the eiffel tower from the balcony so much for upgrades nice hotel in a great location next to luxembourg gardens and the pantheon and   mins walk to center of saint michel the hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors lacking on the fine details some tlc will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things great location comfortable small rooms descent though slightly over priced breakfast the wifi was quite slow at times it seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around my room was a good size for paris the decor was lovely and very french which was nice size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for   people the   beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person beautiful view of the city including side view of the eiffel tower easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries some staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface good location and comfortable room room serviced everyday buses nearly opposite hotel go to the gare du nord for the eurostar excellent choice of restaurants a short walk away in the closet was dust i had to clean hangers at first and then put my things good location not so far from notre dame cathedral   metro station frendly staff beautiful view from room nice area around price quality ratio a lovely well placed hotel i was however only able to afford it when on offer every thing was wonderful the only aspect i would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup the beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central paris the breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order there was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas the reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations i think the price for breakfast at   euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby hotel is in a great location with metro nearby the luxembourg gardens are nearby which are lovely to stroll through and are perfect for relaxing in during hot weather the hotel was modern and had a touch of paris to its interior with staff always haply to help the room was nice and spacious enough for   people in both the rooms we have stayed in it was difficult to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom we ve stayed here before and enjoyed it just as much a second time excellent location near jardins du luxembourg friendly staff tea and coffee in room is a bonus for paris no negative we loved that it was located in a nice quiet neighborhood not in a touristy location so close to public transportation and walking places the staff was always available and friendly breakfast was tasty and the hostess was so sweet she remembered exactly how we liked our coffee although the rooms are small ours was perfect we will request a room higher up and with a balcony next time there wasn t one available on this trip staff rude i had pre paid before we had arrived when we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice hotel is quite old fashioned not up to  star standards rooms are very small also bathroom wouldn t return again no positive could only have the continental breakfast in your room dont understand why room was pretty compact though comfortable not sure where i would have put the breakfast see above nice parisian feel to the hotel loved the lift which was modern while keeping the old fashioned appeal very nice reception and guest area great location for exploring the left bank notre dame and louvre areas room claustrophically small very dark decor even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out if you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it skimpy small hard towels in bathroom hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions on line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large it s a very small lobby and maximum   suitcases and   people in elevator hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway this was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls a few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room we d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard we made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use was ok for purpose used but not one i would recommend to others staff very friendly and will g to assist in either english or french nice clean bathroom large tub ok water pressure the bathroom could be better designed good price great location good side view of eiffel tower very good comparing to my other hotels booked in paris which usually have very small rooms only thing i can complain about was that the batteries were dead in the remote nicest bed i ve slept in in paris in a long time also very quiet even though it was on a busy street room service was overly expensive more than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient very close to major sites and great cafes quiet at night as well being in the location that it is in no negative me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel the location is only   minutes walking from luxembourg rer station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g palais du luxembourg and odeon theatre the room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable the best thing about the room was the view we asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the  th floor with stunning view of eiffel tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good indonesian restaurant named indonesia really worth a try please google the location for details the ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning the cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor not very pleasant at all in the eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for   minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door very good location very very small rooms central heating had air in it and clicked all night what anoyed me was at check out i told the staff and in typical french maner the girl could not care less not even a cursory sorry nothing strange for a us owned business small old style hotel breakfast staff considering the rates for breakfast did not do enough e g direct customers to the coffee machine and milk tray in room with coffee sachets and kettle room is a little bit too small very good location just seven min walk from notre dame cathedral twenty min from the louvre museum modern facilities and antique furniture a nice syncretism helpful staff on the first day we arrived internet was really good but for the other days i cannot say that it was fast also hair dryer isnt good if you have thin hair that dries slowly as mine you have to bring your own even everyone who travelled paris before said that hotel rooms are really small it wasn t that much our room was more bigger than we thought the location is excellent near to rer b station luxembourg also a transfer station like odeon and cluny just walking distance to pantheon luxembourg gardens etc in addition near to a big market monoprix i stayed for   days on the end of november staff was nice room was clean and good as i asked for a window with good air because i have severe dust allergy and i m very impressed the breakfast by room service was good and on time bus stop and subway aren t far from accommodation it s valuable to stay in paris if i came back which i will i ll stay in this accommodation again the room was too small for the price the heat didn t work we had a heater to keep us warm no slippers for a  star hotel close to notre dame staff was nice the hotel was looking good decaf espresso is not available for breakfasr i was staying for   nights and the room was really too small they changed me to a larger room without any problem all was good wonderful room at the  th floor huge n very neat tea pot made my stay much warmer in the morning it was a bit chilly in the room really enjoyed the nice stay and great view over the city thank you room not well sound proofed internet spamodic difficult ss business trip brilliant location for palais de luxembourg sorbonne etc friendly and helpful new bathroom facilities and bed great no negative hotel was spotless breakfast was fab something to suit everyone staff were extremely friendly and helpful hotel is excellently located next to the metro the shower should have had a bigger glass partition to keep water from getting on the floor we had trouble getting clean face cloths every day we had a beautiful room with a balcony that had a view of the eiffel tower we were very impressed with the d cor of the hotel which is quite charming the location was great just   blocks from notre dame the bathroom was outdated and dirty with mouldy tiles dirt around the toilet parts and peeling and cracked paint bodged tiles the bedroom was lovely but extremely dusty i had to use wet wipes to dust the bed head etc as i have a dust allergy and was kept awake the first night coughing in the day light i realised why location excellent and the design and furnishings were very good room very small dark and rather claustrophobic bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room bed pretty small too room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers great location friendly and helpful staff good discount on full room rate making it reasonable value for money breakfast provided free when we checked in also improving value selection of juice water cakes and sweets available free to guests in afternoon room was a little small but that wasn t really a problem you trade that for the great location anyday location was superb staff were really friendly and even humored my bumbling schoolboy french room not that big but clean and nice decor the nearby cafe luxembourg is a classic french experience i wanted to give another guarantee card than the one i had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that i repay my booking with the new card which i did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but i suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of   i had forgotten my passport in the room safe and they were quite efficient to recover it small rooms smelly corridors no soundproof fake pictures on the offer there are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc location the lift i don t think i d want more than two people at a time or one plus one case personally i wasn t prepared to chance it so i walked up and down the four flights of stairs every time bed not very comfy ordering room service time consuming and only after doing so and having to wait  minutes for order did we realise it was outsourced and not done by hotel breakfast room ladies were delightful friendly breakfast was pretty good clean and tidy with complimentary toiletries in bathroom no negative we liked everything great location close to all quiet and over all we all enjoyed our stay what l liked as well was the adjoining room as we had   children i would recommend the hotel to all rooms are very outdated old furniture nasty bathrooms which need a complete overhaul lighting extremely poor rooms small by u s standards hotel rating too high for such poor quality and facilities staff was very superb breakfast was excellent location extremely close to fantastic attractions of paris excellent eateries nearby air conditioning was quite poor at   degrees it was way too cold we preferred to open the window but it s not always an option dust noise lightning might be better bed lights high above the bed and no ceiling lamp and lightning above the mirrow in the bathroom for doing make up comfortable room bed and bathroom spacious wardrobe room robes and slippers friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast location is perfect as well rooms were a bit small but it s paris so this was expected good location to explore the city and st germain we were only in paris for one night but would have been comfortable to stay here for more yes it is paris style but the room and the elevator seem really too small i do really love the balcony we spent many days here and every morning when i wake up the balcony made me a very happy morning the location is also great for women there are many nice food restaurants and nice shops you do not need to worry that nothing to do in the evening because near the hotel there are also many nice bar with good view just   minutes walk to luxembourg park is also great bathroom a little cramped but to be expected for this age of building staff at reception were excellent breakfast was very good bedroom very comfortable hotel just off the boulevard st germaine near notre dame not close to a lot of tourist attractions but reasonable wslking distance no negative excellent location can walk to many tourist attractions metro near by only   mins from charles de gaulle airport beautiful park near by and very helpful staff room is small they don t have their own parking space but on street its available staff is friendly they accept my late checkout they arrange my airport transport breakfast is yummy internet speed is good no complaints although the room was a bit small but for paris standards it was fine we were very comfortable the room was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice bathroom the breakfast was also great fresh squeezed orange juice hot food french pastries bread and more we have nothing but praise for this hotel no negative the location is really the best there are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well you re a     minute walk away from the notre dame as well our room was lovely comfy beds and enough space for   girls with way more luggage than necessary we also had a view of the eiffel tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window perfect the receptionist was impersonal eg asked me if i liked paris but couldnt care less about my answer poor qulity toilet paper terrible quality long life milk in rooms dark rooms with deep red decor gloomy location receptionist ordered taxi for us the bathroom was very small and the lift was slow and small the room while not huge was ok for paris property was in a good location away from the main tourist attractions it was in a decent condition feels like it could do with an upgrade soon though staff were helpful and internet connection was good the breakfast was too widely spread it took a while to realise how much choice there was we have been coming to this little hotel for some time now and are pleasantly surprised at the improvements over the years we loved the fresh orange juice machine door was a little touchy tried not to wake entire hall the staff was always friendly and helpful breakfast was great cleaning person amazing great location great restaurants nearby no free parking as stated when booked only a public car park which cost us   for   days breakfast was not included in the price even though it was suggested this was the case at check in   for   people a day is an absolute rip off no positive narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs this was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems decent self serve breakfast buffet rooms were well appointed and by parisian standards spacious convenient location to walking and public transit   rer b lots of bus lines tables were not cleaned up and the buffet was not replenished staff totally indifferent had to ask several times for items like bread yogurts very small elevator hardly enough for two certainly not enough room for a suitcase good breakfast quality small room but comfortable on the fifth floor quiet i was really unhappy when there where no tables ready for breakfast staff was hiding in a kitchen and did not clean tables and did not prepare tables for new guests i start to prepare table myself as there were nobody to ask for help lady in charge appears in fey minutes and start to follow her duties next time i will avoid to have breakfast in this hotel no positive some minor things beds a little hard a bar fridge in room would have been good carpet in need of some repair in entry to room great location very clean and neat accomodation and helpful staff twin adjoining room for kids was big very thin wall if someone who cannot pay attention to the neighborhood unfortunately stays in the next to your room that s too bad i tried to be patient but i finally knocked the wall at   am in the midnight in order to stop happy laughing british english conversation i could not use the air conditioner because i found a lot of black mold in it then i did not feel good very kind staff easy to access to the station the location is a little bit far from downtown that makes more comfortable very small lift the room was small for   people but adequate via european standards loved the location very close to the university of sorbonne college like feel and great shopping around the corner palace of luxembourg within short walking distance staff was very nice and knowledgeable i had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of paris unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room it was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and i had to stand on a chair to use the safe it was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time the windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in i didn t change my room because i didn t spend much time in it the location is wonderful if you like to spend time in the latin quarter which i do great restaurants in the area close to notre dame cathedral plenty of rer metro stops in case you don t want to walk or would like to get over to the eiffel tower or champs elysee i am on my first around the globe trip which means i ve been on the road for while so the laundromat right on the next block also gave me the opportunity to run a load of laundry for   euros rather than the ridiculous fee a hotel would charge breakfast could be a little better limited choice hotel s location is the best thing top floor city view is breathtaking on a good sunny day near to   train stations luxembourg gardens   min walk latin quarter eateries   mins walk notre dom   min walk room was a bit on the small side had no view good location   minute walk from notte dame the pantheon restaurants within walking distance room a bit small but clean very good breakfastno negative breakfast was good not a massive variety but was enough five minute walk to norte dame and back streets to very reasonable set price menu at restaurants the room was a little on the small side the selection on offer at breakfast could have been better the breakfast offerings was also a bit scattered not everything was positioned in the same area of the room it would have been nice to have fresh drinking water in the room every day not just on the first day more information about excursions in the room would have been good the staff were amazing friendly spoke english all recommended restaurants excursions were amazing the staff also gave excellent advice on staying safe in paris the free toiletries were amazing and showers are very powerful no negative no complaints staying at hotel clean and tidy and not far from tube station breakfast was good bacon sausage and scrambled egg and pastries enough to set you up for the dayno negative we stayed there with our two daughters in connecting rooms it was very comfortable   minutes to main shopping areas in st germain area clean rooms very nice staff pleased with our stay its location is really good so street noise is variable even with the great windows felt totally welcome with our younger kids all staff interactions were really pleasant the adjoining rooms were perfect and for paris we had plenty of room and a huge closet to get our stuff put away restaurants super close by so if kids are babysitting age parents can go across the street for a nice dinner dim lighting would have liked a brighter light near to the desk excellent position close to many attractions on the left bank with proximity to rer and metro stations comfortable room and very friendly helpful staff didn t like not to be able to get extra pillows when we requested them we liked the location and the fact that the building kept its old world integrity the staff did their best to be helpful no negative kindly had the room upgraded hotel was in a brilliant location with easy access to all main attractions staff were extremely friendly and the latin quarter is unbelievably picturesque walls are really thin and you can clearly hear everything from the surrounding rooms everything great hotel and friendly staff location is perfect and rooms are big and clean with great amenities the hotel has character i was impressed by the hotels staff and management on how they go out there way to keep us happy for example helping me with a early check in late check out would definitely stay here again no negative very comfortable hotel with nice location small things makes all the difference i e good coffee machine in breakfast table in the room the is separated small room for clothing and complimentary water in room not usually seen very helpful staffno negative extremely friendly and helpful staff room was fantastic with its view of the effiel tower and always very clean easy to walk from hotel to all major attractions and very close to subway if you don t want to walk we had a great long weekend away would come back again no negative great to be located so close to both st michel and odeon stations also short distance to luxembourg gardens the staff at reception were really personable and helpful kids   and   yrs old appreciated and enjoyed the chocolates at reception had breakfast once at the hotel and it was great found the hotel to be homely yet efficient was good to get a triple room too which was really comfortable and not that easy to find poor communication due to language barrier we found it hard to ask nor just say simple words in english the food was good and the servers were helpful the room was really small with a tiny window with view to the air conditions system of the hotel great location really close to luxembourg garden all was good the hotel was in a good place not far from the latin quarter the metro was the odeon on line   direct from the gare du nord no fan in bathroom rer journey from cgd to luxembourg at     nightmare to be avoided staff excellent very helpful perfect location rooms rather tight but i guess that s to be expected in central paris good clean hotel and friendly staff good breakfast choices and facilities too old weary and tiny never four star hotel too expensive for its fercility don t be cheated by the photos only location is good staff not very friendly a smile would have been nice door to bathroom wouldn t close spacious room small dressing room very nice very quiet no negative great hotel romantic and typical french exactly what we were looking for the location is perfect good area central and near everything a grab handle above the bath for safety being a newshound i loved having bbc     and news channels appreciated the coffee tray very comfortable bed no negative good location near train station with direct connection to charles de gaulle airport rooms are small but have everything you need no negative great views of the eiffel tower from our room on the top floor and staff were helpful although breakfast a little pricey so we ate ours out bedrooms could have minibar staff is great breakfast fantastic and the location is just perfect with a bonus view of the eiffel tower staff need to help book sightseeing even if it is in the pm i stay here whenever possible location by luxemborg gardens is awesomeno negative i didn t want maid service but the maid put a bag of fresh towels on the door regardless which was nice no negative the shower was very difficult hard to use without the water going all over the floor we got used to it but not idealno negative the room decor is very nice and new the bathroom is newly renovated however a bit on the small side but convenient triple room was a bit on the small side as was the bathroom location and ease of check in and check out extremely helpful staff as well i was told we were upgraded to a superior room and the room was the size of a shoe box location and cleaniness the rooms are small however it s a small price to pay for the location beautiful view of old paris and the eiffel tower staff not very helpful when asking for advice of where to go what to do about paris over new years eve great location lovely hotel the shower curtains is too easy to leak to the bathroom floor even if you put it into the tube it still leak the room is very clean and the facility is very thoughtful breakfast was not good i had the advocado toast and it was tasteless my daughter had the potatoe rosti and it was awful soggy and greasy door man was absolutely fantastic we got a great rate through bookings com no negative the brochure in the room stated breakfast until noon however it finished at   so we missed out it cost a lot more to have breakfast included on the room rate so was not happy been stopped by the door man and asked to produce our room keys to prove we were stopping there stereotyping due to tattoos beautiful hotel with large stylish rooms super fast service at reception well although i liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge i like the bed and large pillows especially all is good except the room is a bit small avoid the dingy standard rooms facing the courtyard soviet style views dated and worn furnishings and subpar luxury high tea was very exquisite and memorable bar and restaurant staff beyond reproach concierge was exceptional and arranged the best theatre tickets in the house on such short notice the upgraded superior rooms facing hyde park definitely worth the price for the added space and views club intercontinental the perfect atmosphere and setting for breakfast and cocktails the intercontinental breakfast was kind of limited in terms of options especially for the price charged in the room the espresso machine didn t work or i couldn t find out how helpful staff busy lobby great location proximity to the tube stations hyde park i have stayed here occasionally over   years the breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling the cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs the magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else there used to be an omelette area that s gone too for warm food you have to choose off theo randall s italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices if the food we had was a reflection don t even bother the fried rosti tasted like a brick service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor if this is ihg s flagship hotel in london then unfortunately the   star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast i guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs go across to the serpentine caf for a better breakfast also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies so beware if you are not so mobile we will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in london in the future excellent location near hyde park and oxford street friendly staff breakfast buffet has poor selection of foods and i had to pay   for the toast and butter i had breakfast wasn t included in the booking location comfort employees room almost every thing except breakfast not enough coffee in our room only   packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup the coffee supplied at breakfast the following morning was cold and had no taste of coffee whatsoever this was our second visit and all was good i asked for a quite room but since the room i booked was of a standard higher than regular i was given a bigger but louder room facing busy street i had to change at   am in the morning no positiveno negative the staff and the room were very good and we had a bowl of complimentary fruit we did not eat there other than a complimentary birthday cake which was brought to our room jade on reception was very helpful the room s view location the staff should informed me during the checking in that the room will view to the intrnal yard which i may ask them for upgradeno positiveno negative everything as should be exellent location very friendly staff smiley faces all over the hotel they offer you the help without asking very clean room luxurious room very comfortable bed taxis available all round clock hyde park corner underground station is next door main attraction in london is in walking distance hyde park green park harrods oxford street buckingham palace marble arch london eye the bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use i did not have time to use the hotel facilities for a one night stay however the bar service and staff in the lobby area was excellent my over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay the concierge service was excellent comfortable bed and pillows very clean over all the bellman was lovely i was promised another room with a better view but when i checked later there was nothing in the system about it but when karem the night manager heard about it he immediately contacted me and came him self to my room to make it right room size attention from staff especially karem the night manager   bed quality is poor king size bed is simply   singles joined pillow choice and mattress is poor   no free wifi   room size not great for price   excellent location walking distance to most places and tube bus stops nearby   staff were helpful they didnt clean my room for   days even though i called them to confirm about cleaning and tidying the room also i didnt have the clean my room door hanger nor the don t disturb one no positive i was disappointed with the spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment we only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so the hotel is excellent and in a great location all of the staff were very friendly and breakfast was very nice they didn t clean the room one day had to call   times for someone to bring shampoo ordered croissants to my room at     am and they were dry friendly staff nice breakfast menu beautiful hotel this hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel the breakfast is very poor quality and the service terrible the food was like transport cafe food dreadful quality and at     for   shocking our iron in the room didn t work not a big deal but i would have like to run it over my dress before dinner the rooms are lovely we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful as our stay was for my husbands  th birthday this made it extra specialno negative amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect we even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our  th anniversary thanks to all the staff i asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while the staff treated us like old friends and were helpful without being overbearing i took my car which was parked overnight without any problems the room was below expectations although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street when we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com for this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity it was a definete disappointment on our part my advice is either pay a bit more and prefer   seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton they re all  meters away from each other having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm the location was good nothing perfect stay not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on park lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special upon arrival i mentioned that it was our  th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele i was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like vip s you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again my biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests rarely have i spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me the rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay undoubtedly a luxurious hotel excellent facilities and a great gin menu the hotel is perfectly located to explore many of the capital s best known landmarks and shopping streets on foot breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table great location helpful polite and well trained staff although the breakfadt room melee and staff involved were a little less well organised nothing none i m very pleased that we choose to stay at intercontinental london park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment i already rated the property   but what i really wanted to mention here is the concierge micheal petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc we felt so spoiled this time thanks to them i totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our hotels in the gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an english breakfast like any other hotel we are totally booking in it again the rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes i hear sounds coming from the rooms while i am walking to my room everything is perfect the reception rooms cleanliness and the staff i really recommend this hotel very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too excellent breakfast and good service very comfortable room and bed personal touch of card and cake for anniversary proximity to st james park and buckingham palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner the room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it the toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down we ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if i ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental the taste was disgusting i swear i wanted to vomit after i ate the first bite our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for   instead of   for that night this was the worse experience for me ever i didn t like anything in the hotel and i checked out from the second day and shifted to another hotel air conditioning a bit noisy friendly staff great location good size room clean lovely comfy bed good facilities and a great bloody mary in the cocktail bar no negative reasonable price with very clean rooms good stuffs about   min walking to harrods super markets restaurants and the transportation are so close very good location it was perfect for us on a one night stay friendly staff quick efficient booking in and out great breakfast theo s restaurant amazing and he came out of the kitchen to talk to guests could have been more than   nespresso pods if you are a couple it would be great to maybe have   decaf   regular pods but then again not many hotels have a nespresso machine in the room to begin with fantastic first impression gorgeous flower arrangements lovely smell very friendly staff great food in the italian restaurant fab bar bus stop is at   minutes walk to hilton h no supermarkets nearby everything was great the staff are very helpful and kind breakfast was limited in choices but yummy room was too hot both windows open heating low as we could get it so hot my partners asthma was set off and he was up all night as he couldn t lie down had to have water from minibar to cool himself the receptionist let us have the water and advised us that next time to call reception to help big pillows and breakfast our room was very warm even with a c and didnt have the best view the mini bar in the fridge was very expensive     for a kitkat and   for a  ml bottle of water though i guess that the majority of patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water the buffet style breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication location and the chap who s name i sadly forget on reception was very friendly and made us feel relaxed   for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value could hear the guest next door easily at night location service and hotel atmosphere amazing gym looked excellent but not used five star checked us in early  am was fantastic and accommodated us when we were late for breakfast excellent service both times towels smells not nice receptionist not fully respect the ambassador golden card i was carried by designating low quality room location room service room was small for the price and not well fitted i e no hooks to hang things up a free bottle of water would have been a nice addition excellent breakfast wifi is not free the wifi cost could have been included in the room price unfortunately i couldn t to get access to the wifi it didn t work smoothly all staff was unbelievably polite no negative everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous one thing i would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my arrival so when i have checked the price of the room i have booked later in the site i found cheaper than the price i booked my room for so i made i contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website i appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for   people and from this perspective i don t think the hotel offers good value for money we also experienced extremely poor service at the arches bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning great location good valet service clean hotel and pleasant breakfast breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel personal note poor phone reception   for small bottle of evian nice room nice common areas good door staff friendly check in service very slow we were at gin and jazz and one of the young male waiters just shrugged when we chased the already late wine earlier in the day we ordered   glasses of champagne in the bar and it took ages to arrive we ordered   glasses of champagne in our room which took   mins to arrive great location and property this time i had a number of issues during my stay namely there were no slippers or bathrobe in the room there was no complimentary water the mini bar was absolutely empty all my cosmetics testers as i came for   days only were thrown away by the housekeepingno positive staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel lack of experience lack of knowledge and i strongly believe they need so much in training location the rate is over priced the breakfast end at    am would be better if its    am the atmosfer at the hotel is very good location near is excellent close to all activity overcharged by hotel on room and i ended up paying for someone else room service hotel did not care and continued to charge my card great location very close to hyde park green park poor service   days asking for something tell they send me corridors are really dirty and we adked for cleaning but they didn t in the breakfast area the treatment is really auful they way they check your room number is like a school manager wated so long to check in plus they refused to give us even  hour for checkout althoug i explaned that i have doctor appointment and its hard to make it on  pm but they didnt care room service is the worst locationno negative very family friendly proximity to shepherd s market central to most places and most of all everything in the room worked as it should and the beds were very comfortable room a little small no room to put your suitcase and no rack to set it on bed was very comfortable and air conditioning and shower worked great cancelled the buffett by the hotel but still keep the promotions in the room menu its bad experience didnt match the service as five star no positive   for a tiny bag of crisps from the mini bar is steep even having regard to the usual mini bar mark up no positive despite ringing ahead to pay so my wife could check in before myself tge staff still made her wait this is despite telling me everything was ok no positiveno negative amazing staff were so helpful with our young daughter and arranging everything for our stay from car parking to baby sitting service and room and cleaning room i like the staff in the lobby that set and the main door bell boy they are the best room actually small outdated and the decor needs a re think the lamps were bigger than the bed location amazing staff all very very helpfulno negative my wife had a migraine we were allowed a late check out at    h at no extra cost the staff could not have been more concerned or mor helpful be careful with the spa they charge for sessions not attended the breakfast a room service top notch great view on higher floors as i said the coffee maker didn t work apart from that i loved it perfect location for the stade de france and metro to centre of paris good bus links to stade de france bus stop right outside hotel pleasant walk back to hotel afterwards i loved the diverse nature of the area coffee maker did not work apart from that the room was spacious clean and comfortable better than i expected oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids nice selection for break fast good coffee location was far from airport and trocadero where i wanted to mainly visit also the breakfast was rubbish hardly any variety the bar next door was very convenient and brilliant hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine the restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area breakfast was good room very clean and comfortable and helpful and friendly staff useful to have microwave etc in room close to the metro too and there is a cash machine shop and cafe right beside the metro there are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family one night we made a group of   adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely it is very crazy and it will be worse and worse no positive location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside however it is not as severe as any of the reviews i have seen previously yes there are quite a lot and i can see how some may be slightly intimidated there are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are room is good comfy beds good size bathroom and toilet isn t massive but plenty of room for what is necessary fridge and microwave so we could store our lunch for the day area has a franprix and   minute walk to the metro so you can buy cheaper food to snack on and get to the centre relatively quickly i didn t like the fact that it s located close to the refugee asylum seeker camp room was sparkling clean food was awesome and staff very nice saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning terrible views from the room unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter comfy beds good room layout horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small overall not worth the price at all big rooms the location we stayed there so our son could walk to an event at salle pullman les docks breakfast was above and beyond never seen anything like it room was perfect service was perfect clean bright everything you could need refrigerator microwave huge bathtub the location was terrible i expected more from the novotel brand i was very disappointed we booked and paid for   nights and left after one i have never felt so unsafe in my life the accommodation was spacious and clean staffs staffs are not good they don t know how to deal with costumer and even not respect they are very rude and talk with bad manner they have to learn some more how to deal with costomers if they still behave like this no one come back in novetel hotel never and ever they gang up with taxi and charge us lot of money for only   minutes way staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard location location is in a very economically depressed area there were over   homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro the rooms have paper thin walls i not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until   in the morning it was so bad i could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed no positive location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in   minute walk we use metro for all our visits no positive outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping there were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area no positive the location of this hotel is horrible when we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood this hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around when we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station we felt very insecure staffs were okay but i feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling few of them were just lazy with their answers also they don t really smile the rooms are spacious and nicely designed we also had our little living room which was very convenient and it was clean the walk from the metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone however would not recommend for single females especially at night clean big rooms and very good breakfast the area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless while we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe the hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc we did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel so this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there we opted to taxi in most of the time rooms were very nice we had a ac issue with one room but the hotel was very responsive to take care of the issue great breakfast other than that the facility was excellent location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside europe furthermore there is so much garbage lying around it is the worst neighbourhood i have seen in paris one does not walk outside feeling safe staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists breakfast was not well organized dirty floor location of food not logical mediocre food paper plates clean room with decent air conditioning there are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital we mainly used uber to travel to places excellent value for money very cosy and comfortable staff were very helpful very happy with the service provided location as such doesn t look safe specially at night lot of people homeless near by not judging location is far from centre but it s cheap and good also near metro station  kms and cheap by uber staff is amazing u can hire wifi for   a day good speed and   security where do i start   horrible location even though it was walking distance from nearest metro porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times   its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons we reached hotel about  pm we went to bed early about     to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic we spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything   entrance thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con breakfast was nice really nice croissants cheese yogurts etc where should i start this hotel is rated a   star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families the metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area it looks like a war zone the area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel it is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel you have to take taxi to ensure your safety i do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced i asked for a refund and management refused this hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in paris the hotel was clean and staff was helpful the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though the family room given to us was big the kids got a lotsa room to play around we had a double bed and a single sofa bed with a pull out in the room loves the separate shower area in the bath room the bath tub is extremely clean and the water pressure was good the room was very clean the front desk service gentlemen were really nice on our first night there as there s no nearby food outlets the service guy proactively recommended some food delivery services and provided us some leaflets and recommendation we had nice hot yummy pizzas and japanese food delivered right to our room the location is about  min walk to the metro easy asses to where we need to go too noisy in the street by night nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until   am room too hot area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant   min walk breakfast ok bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault still they are clean and large breakfast lacks vegetables great rooms large clean well equipped awesome staff several games at reception for kids and not only terrible parking they let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea i do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families no positive the location of the hotel isn t the best the hotel the staff and everything else is great but the location isn t so good its a really rough area there were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with if you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout we re still waiting for one   weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great the room was amazing value for money plenty of room to spread out for a young family self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay hotel is located in very rough area of the paris due to that we had to order unhealthy take aways unable to explore and experience local area travel via uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet no positiveno negative the rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use   rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty i was travelling with wife and   kids i was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us the reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something i have never seen before the rooms are clean and cosy the staff are polite and helpful location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine especially one lady that was incapable of smiling i felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of paris is not very good the room was nice location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite breakfast selection was poor same selection every day staff were not very receptive room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them rooms were clean and spacious firstly it s located in a bad place just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population it feels dangerous to go alone in the streets facilities were ok as it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant but this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant they claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi rooms weren t cleaned properly someone s inner were lying inside my room toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane it was just an ordinary hotel didn t turn out to be bad but wasn t able to live to the standards of novotel the only good thing was that they were able to arrange taxi for you location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible and in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people this made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e no tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room rooms were nice and spacious the room was so hot i could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak i use my data the location was quite unsafe the hotel was clean and comfort room appears clean but smelly bad odour in corridors as well breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out the area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy could not wait to get out of that place no positive location is really rough and nothing really around we took uber everywhere to avoid walking around the area as it was really off putting had a lot of beggars really nice hotel don t know why they would put it in that location the shower was really nice so was the room the second bed was a bit decieving from the listing we thought we were getting a   bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain seemed like a newly renovated or just new hotel great facilities in the rooms causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible initially counter lady was nice to us but when we asked for  nd floor room spl request already accepted by hotel due to health conditions she put us on  th floor not comfortable to us despite repeated requests nothing done we had to stay at friends house for from paris the location makes you feel unsecure there were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel the hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway good clean towels without visible stains the location and neighborhood is less to be desired graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover please look after your belongings when approached by beggers when traveling at night use vtcs type very reasonable price room was very cosy and good standard two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts really clean comfy and spacious room area in which hotel is located is not the best one clean facilities are good espresso coffee machine in room good size room value for money metro is   min walk nothing everything this is best place to stay very nice people there and they speak more than   language it was just perfect very clean nice quipements nespresso caf machine in your room and   capsules every morning the carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor it wasnt very pleasant to walk over also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope no explanation why i liked the big spacious rooms the fridge and microwave in room was very handy location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it great staff spacious and meticulously clean room breakfast started as early as   am very close to metro station except constant plumbing noises heard in my room we have   persons when i booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me the room is comfortable and staff are nice restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there very poor service it was quiet but that was it the area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility but then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall closeness to metro station and chick appeal of restaurant the location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item the same food was brought out that had been out the day before the same stale quiche had been put out all three mornings i was there the bed was very comfortable as they always are in novotel the price is more relative to the location than the hotel although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times a small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room this didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others the staff were really attentive and helpful with all queries hotel quality was really good for the price and there was a good selection of food at breakfast can t fault the hotel also had a nice view of the sacre coeur from the room although it is right by busy traffic from main roads the room was silent thanks to two sets of windows as a woman travelling on my own i thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant i was also disappointed that the english language tv service in the room did not work as advertised the room was spacious comfortable and clean the bathroom was well appointed with no frills the staff were helpful the staff were super rude and not helpful at all half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave when we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of paris in an area full of drug addicts and some other unpleasant creatures better get a room in the centre if you can afford it no positive if you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush clean and comfortable beds very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood never even try to book there there were people using drugs just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us the staff was not helpful and grumpy on top of this the tv was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of paris right next to the dumping ground a big no if you want to stay safe no positive slightly small reception basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of   euro all day superb lovely modern room very comfortable beds secure and safe hotel air con didn t work properly they threw away my water bottle which was on the desk lovely spacious room separate toilet and bathroom   sinks divider in the middle of the room great location for st dennis stadium and gare du nord modern blackout blinds   sets of windows so room was very quiet parking is super expensive hotel staff really dishonest we had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill room was very spacious clean and stylish i booked for   guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for   person when explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately she would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and i received was one of the worst i have ever experienced i would never stay here again and i would not advise anyone else to stay here nothing a lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if   year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid st denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what i needed avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast i and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle the hotel was close to a venue we were attending also close to a metro clean comfortable hotel good size rooms and bathroom no tap end on the bath and room enough for two the toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell there is no aircon lucky for us it was cool weather but i can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable the area is not safe we walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us we just kept walking faster and went into the metro station it was very scary as we had our   month old baby with us we are so grateful the man did not hurt us the room was a good size very comfortable staff very friendly and helpful paying extra for parking the room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads lots of people begging and living rough outside friendly staff the surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around there also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they had a good knowledge of the area the fact that it was such a direct route for stade de france we were there for the rugby match france v england i could not fault anything stayed in paris last year and hotel was poor real disappointment and not what it looked like in photo s we were delighted with this hotel and it really made our stay more enjoyable i would and have recommended it to others since our departure on sunday the staff were very helpful and friendly the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than   euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms no positive the location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area the bed and room was lovely very spacious and the hotel itself was very clean and well decorated the nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere i want to see in paris although i did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure highly responsive staff new wide clean and comfortable rooms coffee tea water is complimentary in the room the big table in the room and microvawe is a plus is the worst possible location the hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station hotel looked clean but can safely say this is not a   star hotelno negative i booked online for my parents and called the hotel with a couple of requests the receptionist was very helpful and professional the booking and payment went very smoothly my parents said that they loved the hotel and that the room was very nice they also loved the breakfast and booked it for the entire stay the location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area there is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel or maybe there s a secret passage that i missed who knows in any case after walking   minutes i felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro soundproofing was adequate considering that the hotel is located right next to the boulevard p riph rique the highway that goes around paris poor housekeeping service housekeeping staff were not able to understand english difficult to explain your needs spacious room microwave and electric kettles were provided the bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too the hotel is good big room nice bed the staff is very friendly so the good part is the hotel this is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe it was at times like walking through a war zone the room was perfect staff were fantastic very helpful and couldn t do enough for us we forgot to lock our safe one day and nothing was touched would recommend this hotel to everybody just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere spacious rooms with nice view knowing i was in the   th floor with a great bathub near to the metro nice breakfast as well location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard rooms were really clean and i am a very fussy person with cleanness but give it     however the way to that about   minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel my family and i didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security i don t recomend the proximity to the subway was very good the location i would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night nice hotel comfortable room friendly staff and nice amenities we were surprised there was even a nespresso machine in the room the location is very poor there are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel no taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood there are prostitutes in same area saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on the view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc no eifel tower views from my window the suite was excellent as it had the things i like including espresso machine fridge microwave dining table large bathtub separate shower separate toilet closet extra single bed couch good double bed fairly close to metro which is the subway system location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass would not recommend this fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways not good if you re using it as a base to explore paris attractions stay somewhere else staff delightful with one notable exception nothing to say all was good location to main station was excellent and metro station was near by staff where very friendly overall a very good place to stay as you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of paris it is not far to get into town once you reach porte de la chapelle metro station but it is a decent   minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed let s just say i wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless i am in a group of   guys there are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around porte de la chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there gym needs to have some weights and a bench aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups i suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay great amenities and very clean room good base for us to visit all the tourist sites nothing exceptional about this place but great value for the price if you compare to other accommodation in paris very bad service the door card did not work twice have to go down from  th floor to the service disks staff members don t feel any sorry about the door card did not work no sorry don t care customer s feelingno positive the air condition is not working poor in every thing the hotel is no air condition it s too hut you can t sleep or stay in room no way to get more it s better to look for another hotelno negative the bed was very comfortable and there was a variety of channels to choose from on the tv the gym was also well equipped we arrived   h after check in time still we had to wait   minutes to get our room which was not nice cleanliness and facilities of the room weather but didn t put us off huge bed comfort after long travel ease of getting into paris central great breakfast clean room it feels unsafe walking outside the hotel during night breakfast wasn t that good hotel room is big and was nice and tidy location of hotel disappointed that there were improvements going on in the hotel no on site facilities for meals room was very spacious room to small which was difficult to navigate with   large suitcases our room wasn t made up till about     in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day close to kensington palace which is the reason i stayed there georgeous lobby and sitting room full of history helpful staff in relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the  th floor so i could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof as they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so i was happy that they moved us location and staff very small single room and an even smaller shower  ft x  ft square difficult to get in and out at my age   i am glad i was not obese to get to my room was by lift and stairs not easy with a suitcase staff helped staff were very helpfull hotel was clean location close to   underground stations bayswater and queensway close to shops and hyde park the rooms were quite small even though we had a club room in particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge i booked this hotel because of the architecture of the actual building and the price was ok the building was beautiful nothing not to like the room single though small was very comfortable the breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice the staff polite helpful and efficient we were not happy with the room it very small fortwo people it was difficult moving around each other as well has having our things in the way the bed was very comfortable there was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly the breakfast was amazing so much to choose from there s something for everyone none of the windows in the hotel open which can be a little stuffy in the rooms this isn t down the the hotel though as the building is listed and they can not change the windows breakfast was very good style of the hotel suited what we like we were booked into a superior room but the bathroom was accessed down steep stairs and that small that it was in my opinion dangerous the property was historically interesting and the staff were excellent the furniture needs a bit of renovation wanted to have their breakfast but the kitchen smell was all over the dining room so went to out the loacation is very good views from windows always ask for rooms with the view on main street otherwise will get noisy neighbors and some kind of warehouse that starts business     in the morning typical london hotel in historical building friendly staff good location value for money pictures of the hotel on web site are real i m glad that i booked this room for   instead of close to   on the hotel s website the room was smaller than expected but furnished in a way that made it very comfortable and usable i also liked the electricity saving device that turns off all the lights once you leave the room no negative old hotel was grand once no doubt reminded me of genteel poverty our room looked onto back of other buildings and dumpsters which were unloaded early in the morning very small rooms busy street on other side of the square with shops lots of tourist tat chemists and eateries the only thing that bothered me was the size of the room with   people you couldn t pass each other that said all the good things and especially the location compensated this staff was friendly the hotel was clean and the breakfast really good the room was tiny for the price the room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed the window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what i d imagine a prison to have i was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room great staff but just wouldn t stay again as i wasn t comfortable in the room the breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant they were really friendly and always keen to help very close to queensway tube and on the doorstep to hyde park room was so small and bathroom was even smaller showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike hotel was relying on its location undeniably good but the room and bathroom sizes will eventually be it s undoing people expect more these days and are prepared to pay moreno negative the staff and management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them the breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food the rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that thumbs up for this hotel good location just off bayswater road close to queensway and bayswater tube stations the reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems definitely i ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel when you ask reception that can i have a bottle of water you will got right away this answer we have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back you have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning no positive could not get the tv to work not overly concerned room small but i guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items room clean and smart the bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat i had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good i asked for a quiet room and i only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular it was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice the room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel we were told we were given an upgrade i cannot imagine what we were supposed to have also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose the bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up the demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again there was very little thought put into these issues on the whole i feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn breakfast was excellent liked everything i had to wait at reception for check in for   minutes and i was annoyed the kind italian gentlemen at the reception added free breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until i had a smile and accepted the apology the free breakfast was very good and i would definitely of paid for it variety of things to have i checked out but my meeting was at  pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until i was ready to leave the staff definitely cared about their customer being happy thank you i d definitely come again i paid for club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit   suitcases in it additionally there was only a really narrow small window a friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell the room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay i am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our   day stay the carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had   different responses from   different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure the only positive is the location of this hotel the room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors great old building that s kept in good shape immediate access to hyde park and a nearby london underground station were both very nice the staff were busy but alert nice and efficient hot sandwich from room service was cold tiny room but this is typical for london especially a single room very welcoming staff requested a room with a bath i received it gorgeous character and reception lounge area with fresh flowers excellent price service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at     at night and cost of breakfast location near two tube lines and hyde park public areas were beautiful vintage the room was very small and it was an upgrade i am a tiny person and i felt a little clausterphobic in the room the bathroom was incredibly small i would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side the staff was really friendly and they upgraded us to a coach room sizes of room and toilets the rooms were not in good shape the  st room was so small we could just about get   suitcases into the room and then there was no floor space for an ironing board we requested a change the next room was better though in a semi basement but the toilet was so small and the wash basin smaller about  inchx  inches the tap looked enormous since the basin could not have been any smaller the pictures of the rooms should be made accurate the room had no windows which i know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating small issue though not a deal breaker and if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room awesome location very close to queensway tube and bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores hyde park bus stop excellent reception and staff although my room was small which is normal by central london standards it was extremely well appointed had everything one would need breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared no negative all the staff were polite and welcoming and arranged taxis do my destination as required you never felt second best excellent hotel and staff the room was the smallest room i had ever seen it was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos the was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on it was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed the staff were very helpful and polite no negative our room was small as was the bathroombut it was clean and comfortable the location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to restaurants and shopping kensington gardens is right on the doorstep perfect for an early morning run it s an easy walk to many attractions including the portobello markets the hotel is charming with comfortable lounge areas the rooms were tiny this was a deal breaker i do not recall seeing sizes when i booked but i acknowledge they may have been listed at that time i know they are listed now because i looked it up if we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical from what i can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms the single induced claustrophobia we usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc that was impossible in this hotel the hotel was very clean breakfast and tea were great service was great at the meals as well common areas were beautiful each room had its own temperature control including ac location was great no negative location was very close to the queensway tube easy to find friendly check in and check out bathroom was very clean and recently refurbished i will look at staying here again as it is ideal for my business trips they tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues we refused and a room suddenly became available the rooms were not as grand as the reception area near to hyde park which is what we wanted being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience location the shower sprayed water everywhere good breakfast selection and quality complimentary water and teas were great a wonderful last minute stay in a hotel that felt part of the history of london yet was beautifully up to date in facilities rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic staff were friendly and great location especially for the price noisy both out on the street and in the hotel double bed was two single beds together lovely old building pleasant staff very handy for hyde park concerts lancaster gate tube station about   mins walk deluxe twin booked a big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior a bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them if that was superior i d hate to see deluxe what on earth is standard like good location nothing to fault staff were amazing and attentive from the moment i arrived at reception desk the guy at reception was checking   separate groups in at once so nobody had to wait got me a room with a bath as i asked for gave me late check out the next day i have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world for alot more money and the service here was one of the best i have ever experienced our room it was the smallest room i have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose i booked a superior double room it was not a double and definitely not superior i had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom i have stayed in many hotels including in paris and this is the smallest by far when we arrived at the hotel approx    pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience for the price we paid it was not value for money the building history edwardian design in the public areas the room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking the actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at in view of all this we felt it was very overpriced good breakfast a beautiful old building full of character comfy bed quiet the room was on the  th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night the room was the tiniest room that i have ever stayed in and i travel a lot to london and abroad the regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre i literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom the room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy the photographs within the booking details are misleading the location was perfect for an event we were attending in hyde park the room was clean helpful staff who responded to my concern about the comfort of the room politely when i landed in london i received a call from grande royale hyde park booked via your website they informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating after visiting another hotel paddington hotel which was more distant from the hyde park and looked like it should have     star rating i went back to the grand royal and demanded the room magically the room was available about   smaller in size than the one i booked towels with hair on sorry its far from   star disaster location the only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked   be moved they were helpful   accomodete us with another room it was central for   get where you wanted   be it was nice clean staff were helpful polite by room could have been a little cleaner there were stains on the walls and on the lampshades it s in a beautiful location i love the old english feel the lobby has and the staff is very nice the room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money i wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey good location easy enough to get to by tube from kings cross and lovely that the history has been preserved great choice at breakfast i ve stayed twice with different friends and they both agreed it was lovely hotel was overbooked due to multiple people booking same day on booking com hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us so all ended well great restaurant wonderful atmosphere and excellent location no negative our stay at the grand royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room the staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options we loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too we were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit london we highly recommend the grand royale hotel is a little tired in some public areas that need re painting very comfortable bed in a double room on the  th floor so it was nice and quiet good location within a few hundred yards of bayswater road and only four minute walk from bayswater tube station some of the back stairs to the rooms could do with a bit of sprusing up bar area also needs some touching up staff very friendly and helpful hotel rooms and lobby spotlessly clean rooms are small but perfectly formed with all mod cons double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short   night stay a really good location close to hyde park and central london staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful we will definitely stay here again when visiting london good value our room was incredibly small the hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down we paid a very reasonable rate for the room through booking com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get also the communal toilets in basement not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone the location of the hotel as we were visiting hyde park the history ambience of the original edwardian house hotel although not all confirmed would love to be a fly on wall back in the day some very beautiful ornate decor on the ground and upper ground floor we wondered about the history as part of write up states you can very much feel the presence of lillie langtry especially in the theatre bar where she allegedly put on shows a very interesting property we had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed friendly staff tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window no positive rooms are very small could barely move around we weren t in it all that much but make sure you pay attention to the size of the room you are booking staff was wonderful location was perfect couch pull out bed the mattress was so old it sank to the middle and i had to hang on to the furniture beside the bed to pull myself out also slept for the week with the bars under the mattress poking me in the back and leg asked for different mattress but wasn t available needed to just buy a new mattress and throw that one away the main bed was wonderful but i wasn t the one sleeping there unfortunately the front desk staff was phenomenal super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information the bell hops were so professional too we didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress nothing really i was very happy with it the manager of the restaurant was excellent had eyes everywhere the room was small but it was a single room and for central london i was very happy with it really the bathroom was lovely easy walk to paddington station comfortable hotel no negative the location and price was great rooms in london are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick if you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged it ends at   am and you probably will oversleep we booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t when we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked the hotel was in a great location my room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved it s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning the shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain it is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside service for breakfast was excellent manuela especially staff was very responsive and that is becoming rare i paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe the shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked their large towels are big enough to dry a young child it was ridiculous the hotel was very old fashioned which you don t see alot these days it was designed nicely the room was on the small size as well as the en suite did not see a tip box for the staff as i would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size the bed was comfy the breakfast had a wide range to suite peoples taste the location could not have been better with bayswater tube station and queensway within easy walking distance most of all the staff were so kind and friendly nothing was to much trouble for them good location with easy access to queensway underground station although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a club room but was very small friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover no positive bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay very comfy bed and fantastic breakfast twin room is tiny with very little natural light no hotel parking available great location easy to get to using public transport and round the corner from hyde park the size of the bedroom super small bathroom shower far too small no possibility to open windows for fresh air what happened in case of fire looks obvious they have been maximising the profit by reduced rooms size price location staff small rooms noisy air con units little sleep due to noisy neighbouring buildings room at the back of hotel overlooking the bins well presented entrance do not test the fire alarms without informing arriving new guests that are jet lagged and sleeping this was extremely upsetting the location was convenient to buses and metro hyde park and kennsington gardens are right there the staff made up for a major inconvenience towels were small room was a bit on the tight side provided shampoo and body wash smelled good but left odd feeling on hands large bathroom quiet air con it was a heat wave when we travelled free wifi handy phone to take with us with internet access usb and international adapters provided in convenient location staff were lovely tiny room bathroom very small shower size the smallest i have every been in fridge not cold iron and ironing board cheap and barely worked complimentary water   x small bottles not complimentary no notification of such good air conditioning and comfortable bed staff friendly very clean and a walk back in time to style of the communal areas it was reasonably good lovely old building albeit the superior room is there standard room so a confusing play with words so it was a squeeze to walk around the bed we didn t have breakfast there at london hotel prices i noticed the lack of a face cloth in the bathroom i guess this is not a british convention the breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive the staff overall were friendly and helpful to be honest i was disgusted with the hotel my friend was too big for bed ad he s     and the bathroom was a joke tempted to ask for my money back to be honest i was disgusted with the hotel my friend was too big for bed ad he s     and the bathroom was a joke tempted to ask for my money back the shower cubicle was very slippery and no hand rail we were upgraded to another hotel as grand royale was having plumbing problems we were given transport and breakfast for each day of our stay toilet was too close to wall almost had to sit sideways shower cubicle was too small i m not large but it was all too close for comfort the hotel was in great location next to hyde park excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for lily langtree to perform for her king immaculately clean room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room there wasn t anything i did not like extremely friendly staff very comfortable facilities many amenities in a very desirable area of london excellent breakfastno negative convenient location near two tube station very close to the city and all main attractions the hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept i stayed in delux single room for   nights the room is small but it has everything you need wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money the exceptionally small bedrooms a double room can nearly fit two people and two suitcases   people cannot walk around the room at the same time old world decoration very friendly and helpful staff good breakfast good location for central line and hyde park no negative loved the afternoon tea every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and i slept on a cot because there were   of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy bedrooms a little small i travelled with my wife on arrival we were not given the room that we had booked first night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter tony rooms location is very good near   tube stops however rooms are super small tiny in fact and i was a single traveller in a normal room and have no idea how   people could fit no negative on this occasion i had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor the public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs the toilet flush did not work properly the sink could not be reached as it was so small cold tap could not be opened without excessive force price per square meter foot has been in top three of places i have stayed room was    m by    m plus bathroom of the    x    total surface  m very but i mean very small rooms tiny bathrooms in my room the window was stuck and not open even a little great breakfast good staff especially razavan at reception magnificant edwaridian common rooms and loby noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once i d rung through to reception and also the manager spotted the notes when i was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with the building is beautiful with so many wonderful period features the staff friendly and efficient and once the tubes had closed for the night it was wonderfully quiet on the lower ground floor super convenient for queensway tube station too i d definitely go back room was slightly small but given the location and ambience of the hotel was prepared to accept that as a small negative breakfast buffet was great with the option to request a specific dish the rooms are small but it is central london stayed for a single night to see a show  st rate staff  st rate service very helpful very welcoming easy access to hyde park which we strolled through to shop on kennisington high st on day   and then left the bags at the hotel after checkout the following day to visit oxford st queensway tube station is just on the next street small rooms specially when have babystroller had stairs in the hallway and in the room not ideal for us good service friendly and helpful staff location was nice close to hyde park have a few shops and restaurants around the corner hotel and rooms was clean and well maintained small bathroom but was enough for the stay hotel in great location for public transport and shopping staff was very friendly great standard bed was very comfortable and the room was clean poor room facilities says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it rooms are tiny for a   star to not have any room service is poor has a fridge which was empty no guest service book had to guess how to even call reception i travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again comfortable bed no negative the location very close to hyde park for pleasant walking and to queensway tube station for the underground s central line to oxford street and shopping and local restaurants shopping etc and notting hill gate ditto double booked at hotel and hotel has yet to refund me me the cancelled booking have disputed double charges with my credit card company and the issue has yet to be resolved in my favor location was ideal for our purposes the first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small we relocated to room   which was the same size as the first ie very small we hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost room   did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after i mentioned it also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall i guess it did work beds comfy wifi is too bad i was at room   club room most of the time i could not go through this is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise i have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international the location is perfect friendly staff and good value for money there was nothing to dislike what an absolutely lovely time we had at the grand royale from the upgraded room to the fabulous breakfast and very attentive staff nothing was too much trouble i would highly recommend this hotel to everyone faded victorian maybe but absolutely beautiful thanks to all who made us so welcome it is obviously not the hotel s fault but there are major building works adjoining and opposite which could be going on for some time some of the rooms are small and a bit claustrophobic excellent location hyde park just across the road restaurants of queensway round the corner the lounges and bars are very atmospheric in a jacobean sort of way panelled and dark but very relaxing the staff are pleasant and generally helpful the price is reasonable given the location for a superior   star room it was small with a microscopic en suite acceptable but disappointing for the price breakfast should have been included better value breakfast was found close by try the italian gardens in hyde park location was good and room was clean and comfortable staff polite and welcoming the rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep the location was wonderful near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites the public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website that s why i picked this hotel in my price range all the hotel rooms in london were extremely small but the grand royale london hyde park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest the rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious the only down side was the room size it was certainly adequate for one person travelling light and staying for one night for two people staying two nights there was very little storage and hanging space for clothes it was clean and it was comfortable the hotel was conveniently close to hyde park where we liked to walk it was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services a convenience store was close by the hotel is a lovely old london town house style and the reception hall and public areas i would describe as baronial the staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable my sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions the english breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost the history behind the hotel was interesting the lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time i need to cancel my last day booking due to schedule change but was rejected by booking com and hotel disappointed with the poor flexibility good location and average price breakfast is nice rooms very small bathroom tiny but very clean and modern hotel is very old and needs new carpets wonderful wood decor but needs refinished it could be a beauty i probably would not go back park across street bus and tube very close the hotel has a nice welcoming fruit basket with chocolates and wine coffee and tea supplied the size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor you could arrange for a common pot for tips the staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter i wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff the room was tastefully decorated and well appointed the facilities such as lighting and bathroom were excellent however it was slightly too small the room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room it was smaller than our bedroom at home the view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade i couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room the pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown the advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune i ve spent over   less per night in london for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities the overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost as it was my girlfriend s  th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room i can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox a plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about all good we stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel we loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom we were   adults and one toddler in this suite breakfast was great as well and the location right next to hyde park and kensington gardens is perfect for kids mommies can go shopping on the westbourne grove   close from the tube station but a little bit hard to find out the location surrounding by houses   window cannot be opened so hot   welcome service for honeymoon was so touched   luxurious atmosphere at reception area   close from the tube station rooms on floor   a little small but adequate a lovely victorian hotel with original features and very friendly staff very clean did the business for a short stay in london excellent nights sleep we had two rooms and we would have preferred they be on the same floor however this was a last minute reservation and it was not possible this was completely understandable the entire staff was exceptional location ideal and rooms comfortable the staff went above and beyond to provide us with every comfort and kindness during our stay in particular razvon at the front desk was top notch in every way imaginable the accommodations were excellent but razvon s warm hospitality took the experience to the next level i highly recommend this beautiful historic and gracious hotel the room was a little cramped and there was no iron ironing board apart from that amazing the staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming the hotel decor was amazing best we have ever stopped in the room was lovely very clean and tidy i feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with the ambiance of the hotel was fantastic the breakfast was superb we had a superior queen room and to say it was a tight fit for two people would be an understatement the room was so small you could not actually turn around on one side of the bed i have a bruise on my arm from whacking it a few times on the handle of the closet as it was so narrow going into the bathroom and out the door the location and price were great the staff was really friendly and helpful and the hotel is spotless the hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when i was checking in what s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident i had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service the hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us after the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred we had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway they were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time as guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless no positive not sure about shower screen it wasn t big enough to stop the floor from getting wet great location and the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they were really friendly and helpful we booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available at the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything we booked a club room with club lounge access from booking com however we found out that the club lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility at least one of the days the lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests no positive tiny bath area and the bathroom could have been cleaner the property is conveniently located near the tube dining spots and various shopping felt very safe the staff was helpful and friendly no negative staff very polite and friendly great location excellent breakfast rooms are modern and comfortable close to   underground stations numerous bars restaurants shops regularly stay in this area and the grande royale is the best hotel i ve used so far the room was extremely small and for   persons with luggage and shopping the space was not enough the property was very conveniently located with tube stations and bus stops within walking distance small room for two people and bathroom very small nice safe location great local amenities and useful having having two tubes and bikes to get through the parks good shower unfortunately the rooms were very small but to be expected in buildings built in that era nicely updated bathrooms tv etc staff were very friendly and helpful location was walking distance to restaurants and tube lobby was lovely had champagne we had brought and staff provided ice and glasses in lobby the size of room and the mattress was so bad and cheap the house made was bother guest on morning even i past do not distribute just the location the bedroom sizes we were upgraded with our bedroom otherwise the bedrooms are a bit small breakfast was great staff very friendly there are   tube stations in walking distance on different lines none the staff are all very friendly and helpful well trained prim and proper customers are given individual attention and not treated as numbers i will surely visit again i found the room dated not very clean fitted furniture hanging off the wall and a smell coming from the toilet drain i can t see how this hotel is rated as four star possibly two star and that s pushing it nothing really room was small and not enough wardrobe space also stairs from room door to room itself meant difficulty negotiating round bed to get to bathroom could easily have an accident during the night and fall room clean and bed comfy lots of choice at breakfast and all well cooked and presented nothing staff helpful and polite bed comfy storage of luggage for the day of leaving easy accsess to underground and open spaces breakfast well presented and good room mattress water leaking the shameful behavior of one of the reception staff and the alternate manager at the time of my reservation knew what i mean nothing the rooms are quite small but adequate for two people bathrooms are very small the hotel has an old style decor but the rooms have been updated and are very clean good location with shops and restaurants within a block or two good access to paddington station for the heathrow express room was a little on the small side beautiful building packed with original features but with all the usual modern facilities perfectly located around the corner from the tube station the room described as superior double was in fact a single room with a double bed in it touching the wall on one side and only six inches from the other the head of the bed was against the wall with approx two feet at the bottom good location near station and hyde park breakfast was very good rooms were smaller than expected and from about  am there was banging coming from above my room i was told this was the restaurant so i cannot recommend this hotel they did offer a   refund but this didn t make up for the unwanted alarm call of banging chairs no positive the hotel checked someone else into my room kept me waiting while they checked their mistakes and then didn t offer or provide an upgrade by way of apology no positive slight issue with the tv as could not receive all channels but staff member assisted though was unable to completely solve the problem the theatre bar was small but full of character very attractive breakfast room was very impressive high ceilings and classy d cor very traditional downton manor style the room was tiny to the point that you had to step aside for the other person to move and the windows wouldn t open not even slighly to get some fresh air something totally unhealthy the stuff was lovely the lobby bar restaurant very nice the location excellent near the park and arounf the corner from well connected public transport i was disappointed that there was no dinner service i would have enjoyed dining in style in that lovely room excellent location near kensington gardens for a lovely walk and interesting places to visit bus and tube very close to explore the city restaurants pubs shops nearby the hotel is a lovely building full of fascinating history and ornate decoration good facilities and all the staff very helpful wide choice to suit everyone for breakfast and a lovely afternoon tea in the beautiful dining room the room was very small the shower was poor the breakfast was to expensive the channels weren t working in the tv i won t be staying in this hotle againno positive maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at reception attracted a   discount why make paying guests jump through a hoop fair enough for non guest but the hotel has already collected   so not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the   difference that much staff friendly it was located further out than we expected had to take taxis to get to places not a lot of restaurants to chose from and did not like the idea of our room in the basement staff was helpful breakfast at hotel is nice hotel is old and we liked that room a bit small very nice hotel staff very good breakfast excellent great formal areas we had a deluxe double which was very small though but this wasn t really a problem as there were great lounges etc noise from construction work across the road in the morning the staff are very friendly hotel was very clean good variety for breakfast central location good quantity of in room tea and coffee comfortable bed lift available no a c very hot breakfast a bit high but good the beds were sooo comfortable the young men to carry the bags were great it was close to two tubes and kensington the room was a little on the small size and was difficult to get around the bed to get into it gorgeous looking hotel very central location great wifi coverage bathroom was minute my partner who is  ft   struggled to fit in the shower i m  ft   and couldn t move and it was a complementary upgrade i wouldn t want to see the standard accommodation bathroom great location lovely staff they acknowledged my request regarding my purpose for the stay partners birthday they gave us a complimentary upgrade left a box of chocolates a note wishing her a happy birthday and a bottle of wine which was much appreciated we thought the room was a bit smaller than we expected but nevertheless was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our one night stay and did not include things we didn t need or use such as posh note pads and mini fridges a trouser press for the men would have been useful after all there was a hair dryer for the ladies your breakfast was superb and the staff very good the surroudings are dirty looking out from room there is no light above the dressing table in room no   also there is no shuttle van service to heathrow location there are many restaurants to our taste our bedroom could have been a bit bigger sometimes it was difficult to move about close to two tube stations circle and central lines from the hotel it is very easy to reach the main london attractions the hotel bar and dinning rooms are very nice the staff was friendly and helpful our room was smaller than i expected one side of the double bed is along the wall so we could not comfortably open both our suitcases the hotel provides a free mobile phone during your stay with unlimited calls and internet use which is awesome however it was out of battery when we arrived not very convenient but the staff especially claudio was very helpful and looked in other rooms to give us another battery the room size was ridiculously small it was actually a free upgrade so i would not want to our original  pn room i literally have bruises from banging into things the location was great as there were   tube stations around the corner no negative located opposit hyde park beautiful property great facilities lovely room staff were amazing suoer helpful queens park underground only a minutes walk away enjoyed our stay very much i left a top behind rang the hotel told them what happened receptionist took all my details promised to ring back that was   weeks ago not good breakfast lovely in a nice bright dining room room overlooked bins at back but hey one nite buinsess no problem great staff and superb vintage building which oozed class refreshing change from normal chain hotels if more time allowed i would have liked to have appreciated its beauty room is not big few light reception and breakfast room are gorgeous nice breakfast location just next to hyde park is great quiet area bus and metro nearby personnel helpful the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only     m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above location quite good next to two underground stations very nice to stroll through the park in the morning evening the staff is friendly the breakfast is quite nice and diverse but not included in your booking for its price you can find lots of options in the city the rooms were very small specially for a   hotel the photos cheat a little the breakfast was very good the room includes a mobile with internet that you can use for free very usefull for google maps the rooms are small it its a classic old hotel each room has a cell phone to use for calling abroad or using google maps among other things the theater bar was a good meeting place for after seeing a playno negative we had a wonderful stay location is perfect the room was comfortable the staff was very kind and competent at any time the breakfast was really good and service was perfect no negative just by chance i hit upon a hotel with a history it appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story the lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows the breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern apparently edward  th bought this house for his mistress lilly langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate the hotel is in an excellent position being near queensway tube station on the bayswater road and right opposite kensington gardens and about   minutes walk from the palace it took me   minutes to walk through the gardens and across hyde park passing the serpentine and rotten row to reach marble arch no negative even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces and alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness i will recommend this hotel to family and friends i felt like i was in old london which was very special thanks to all the staff as above the bedroom size and bathroom did not reflect the website in our opinion it was misrepresented beautiful building and foyer small rooms and bathroom the room is a little bit small than what i had initially thought i travelled on my own and didnt spend much time in the room so its alright however it would be a lot better if its just slightly bigger and i have a bit more floor space the staff were friendly and helpful the location s amazing so near bayswater station and central to everything around the area very strategic also amazing decor in the hotel itself the beds sagged a lot handi the electronic guide was great i don t know how we would have seen so much without him a fabulous idea also thank you for acknowledging my daughter s birthday the room was not what i expected from the booking and a hotel of this nature the manager has been directly reviewing the concerns and contacted me directly i found the property incorrect for myself i have raised the concerns i had with the manager directly who has taken on concerns and feedback they have responded positively to feedback and been very professional i did not try the food at the hotel but did note the galaxy hot chocolate sachet in the room no negative bed was ok not great room really small staff very friendly i basically slept there and was out the whole day so it s quite expensive to just sleep and shower but generally a decent deal even with a double upgrade room super small double bed for   used to   queen or a king but europe london different breakfast good staff very helpful location there was nothing that didn t come up to description or photographs the location was excellent near plenty of bars restaurantshops coffee shops and two tube stations view from the room was of piles of rubbish bins so we were unable to open the window during the night the bathroom had a very very small shower which was not very pleasant to use bed was very confortable and the room was clean and modern the room was a bit small so it lacked a proper place to work on the laptop but sitting in the beautiful lounge makes up for this fantastic building like staying in a little museum friendly helpful staff i liked the handy device in the room and the fact they had a spare plug converter for me rooms are absolutely nothing like the pics on the net and are grubby with dirty marks on walls and switches heating didn t work in room review would be better if the hotel managed expectations with realistic images of rooms good location and some really good staff beautiful building with some lovely features larger room but accepted it was in london all the staff were very helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble the room was rather small but facilities were excellent fruit water biscuits etc the room was one of the tiniest i ve ever seen there was mold on the bathroom ceiling and you can hear noise from the hallways and nearby rooms on one occasion our fresh towels smelled like feet the lobby is very nice and the proximity to both the queensway and bayswater tube stations cannot be beat bar was beautiful staff member behind it needs extra training in customer service lovely style in the reception and lobby staff on front desk and porters were lovely very friendly not sure i can find a fault the rooms were very clean and comfortable especially for london where they tend to be rather small good value for money and very friend y and helpful staff the cleaning of the room while proper seemed a bit sloppy she must have broken a glass while cleaning because we found broken glass on the floor just once the assistance of arnor was a real pleasure throughout the staff at the front desk were also very pleasant we did not like the exit of the queensway subway station the sizes of some rooms were very tiny i took my students to that hotel and it was great very well located with plenty of affordable restaurants two good grocery stores and access to the subway system with two easy access to it there were lots of staff to assist you they were courteous and doing their best to accommodate our needs i will certainly go back again next time i have to stop in london room was a little cramped the staff were excellent and the location perfect for the sight seeing we wanted to do very close to two tube stations shops and places to eat the original room i was placed in i could touch both sides of the room the room smelt like it hadnt been aired for weeks and when changing the size of the room improved but it was still slightly run down for what you would consider a   star hotel bathroom extremely clean and modern wifi was good and stable creaky floorboards i know to be expected thin walls small rooms at night our neighbours snored very loudly and watched fv in the hours that we should all be asleep location style history staff had breakfast in room for   but sent on   plates and wasnt the best quality also a room for   was double and pull out sofa but no bedding pillows duvet etc provided on request though hotel staff were amazing although noisy in a morning lol but was a quiet hotel on whole steps down into a tiny room with creaky floors too hot window sealed shut and air con not effective great character and location just off main road making it quietno negative my sister and i bought our parents a trip to london for christmas and we all went in the end of march we stayed at grand royal hyde park for   nights and enjoyed every minute of it the staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old london interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in london anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok the hotel is basically across the street from hyde park and only   min walk to queens way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around london very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything so yeah definitely a place we would all return to a really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in london in general awesome staff and service great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening will definitely return nothing really to complain about breakfast is on an expensive side but we did not have it so cannot judge quality it is relatively nice hotel rather typical interior for london based hotels room was fair and wifi worked very well hyde park is close which is a big plus the elevator is too small for the hotel s size on the other hand at least they have one the rooms were clean and comfortable the breakfast is outstanding and an excellent value the staff was very helpful and accommodating the lobby bar and sitting room are absolutely beautiful and very interesting our room was a bit small though well equipped and comfortable great location room we were in was quite small but many larger rooms available lovely location just a moment from hyde park and close to transportation by bus and the undeground hotel is vintage but is in excellent shape staff was very helpful and friendly and services top notch misleading photos th rooms are far too small  by   is hardly a room to relax in there is no heating the day time this hotel should only be rated a   stra and not   which is misrepretations of the hotel i would not use it again no positiveno negative the staff we excellent hiral went above and beyond for our birthday easter trip chocolates wine cake an egg hunt we won and then a lovely complimentary drink in the theatre bar it was the loveliest atmosphere we genuinely loved everything about our experience the staff were   amazing nothing was too much for them the hotel was fabulous and soaked in history and character this was first class hospitality with ano affordable price check in was very slow and although very clean the room was very small and the shower room was worse that being in a cupboard the basin also was leaking over the floor overall not that comortable lovely building and a great location no negative they have smartphones with internet and phone calls in each room available for customer to take with them while going around the city perfect for maps looking up to places and restaurantes also free of charge old blood on the duvet told them about it and got it changed but thought it was a bit odd upgraded room to club and was very small location was good bathroom was small but adequate for our needs staff couldnt do enough for you fantastic breakfast very clean perfect for an overnight or short break very small rooms some rooms have no windows and some have windows but no view there is a wall blocking any possible view clean hotel and very closed to the hyde park and the shops walking distance to two metro stations staff are very nice and keen to help the bathroom in the room we were moved to although we went from a superior room to a club room because of maintenance work the bathroom was     smaller and no bath the wash basin was a cup with a tap the location of property close to all restaurants and transport into city no negative very friendly staff extra warm welcome while checking in felt like you were expected there anytime breakfast had a wide variety tasty the room was cleaned every day it had a romantic setting when we arrived there wasn t anything i didn t like about this stay or hotel the staff hotel manager were so helful friendly which made a huge difference to our stay the tea coffee cups were too small in the room excellent location close to both bayswater queensway tube for easy access to the city but far enough out to feel away from the hustle and bustle customer service was excellent from all the staff experimentalist outside the window violent custody dumping warning nice breakfast marvelous stayed there at my london trip for three days with free breakfast lucky me romantic architecture at the breakfast room no negative the staff were very accomodating and kind we had a lovely comfortable stay it was very convieniently situated being just around the corner from the queensway tube stn and directly across from beautiful hyde park the breakfast buffet had a great selection and no shortage of anything i will certainly stay there again no negative we were given a tremendous welcome by the staff as it was my partners birthday they left us a personal note some chocolates and some wine and soft drinks in the room very welcome after the morning s travels when we arrived back to the room that night there was some birthday cake waiting for her it was a lovely personal touch and very much appreciated rooms can do with some tlc and are much smaller than anticipated room   was quite warm and the split system would blow warm when placed on cool and cool when placed on warm bathroom ventilation is poor also cleaning staff half heartedly serviced our room on two occasions if you need a taxi do not use the hotels affiliate service they will rip off any unnasuming tourist   for a four minute car journey i don t think so lobby and aesthetic appearance down stairs is great the rooms were small in size and had a congested feel not enough space for suitcases and to move around i was initially in a double room then upgraded to a king size room thinking that it would be more spacious but it wasn t no positiveno negative i stay every month and as always staff are very friendly polite and make you feel welcome location is fantastic   mins walk from queensway tube central rooms are clean and spacious compared to other central hotels food is basic but good and a great selection at the bar not too pricey either definitely recommend the room was smaller than a closet it was not reflective of the website and descriptions another guest checked out for same reasons as i was trying to revolve the room issue no ventilation in room manager made effort to assist staff was friendlyno negative staff were really friendly and went above and beyond when they found out it was my partners birthday with complimentary wine and chocolates breakfast was lovely with a wide selection to choose from i would definitely stay here again the hotel room was tiny and couldn t have a nice shower without banging my body against the shower couldn t get   people in the bathroom the staff deluxe double room too small for   people impossible to fit in zero room for suitcases   tiny wardrobe ridiculous staff polite breakfast good location great there was no chain on room   the deadlock was broken just spun around there is no shower door or curtain in the bathroom the front desk staff seemed a little inexperienced the bed was very comfortable the hot and cold breakfast was plentiful the hotel is beautiful there is plenty of staff room size even club room very compact with only one chair for two guests other one had to sit on bed facing wall very good staff and service breakfast food looked good although no restaurant for lunch or dinner unique vibe and decor free wine fruit and chocolate on arrival personalen var tyv rr inte serviceminded loj och l ngsam gick inte att best lla allt som fanns p menyn g ller b de mat och dryck fint l ge vid hyde park litet rum och badrum no positive the bed was uncomfortable and the shower did not have a screen so the floor ended up soaked after every shower also the tv was quite old and did not have the option to plug a usb in to watch movies etc the staff were very helpful and accomodating size of the room for a   is way too small we requested a twin beds room and there was no space left in the room bathroom is tight but has quality features location wi fi and staff were great room was too small to move around in breakfast was too expensive for what it was you can get the exact same breakfast at a premier inn clean hotel staff where friendly nice shower and comfy bed we where basically in the basement very small room and which was very worn out and it did feel exactly how i imagined a cell would feel like hyde park was nice and it was close we had to change room as the first was so disappointing our second room was hot the air conditioning didn t work and the window could not be opened we had a very uncomfortable sleepless night the staff were excellent friendly and helpful the room was small the bed was hard and there was a split in the carpet were it had been joined together staff were very friendly good breakfasts the building is full of character i wish there had been space for a mini fridge the room was a tight fit for one adult and child also i m sure it was a fluke but found evidence that the room had not been vacuumed from the guest who was there before us she must have had a lot of hair this hotel was super close to two main underground lines it was also close to bus stops also around the corner was a tesco express and other shops to pick up essentials all staff was very friendly and readily accessible for any needed assistance extremely small rooms even for london standards especially for the price average customer service difficult to get to from airport via public transport across the road from hyde park the staff are completely unprofessional no customer service experience what so ever i called in before to confirm my staying and the lady that answer my call has no experience on how to answer my question and no telecommunication skills awful there is nothing to like with the hotel room is quite small for the price the property and its history make a fabulous place to stay rooms are very small but common spaces lobby lounge breakfast dining room stairwells are breathtaking room very small had a single bed and the room had a space remaining of less than a metre between bed and wall breakfast was great excellent location friendly and helpful staff the room was incredibly small very disappointing no room for suit cases no table or chairs my dog has a larger kennel the room was clean and the bed was comfortable the breakfast was good very little we would have liked more space in our room we loved to walk across the road into the park and walk to albert hall or speakers corner and listen to the birds we loved the bottle of wine and fruit excellent very small room created in the attic space with a very small window so glad it was only to sleep in the room was quiet but the skylight lets you know when its raining ease of check in and location nice clean well equipped bathroom staff overall helpful and friendly no negative mysigt hotell med bra l ge n ra hyde park ligger n ra bayswater tunnelbanestation flera resturanger i n rheten hotellet har v ldigt god frukost trevlig personal blev bra kompenserade n r vi var tvungen att byta hotell en natt pga problem med vattnet bedroom was rather small didn t matter for me on this trip as i was barely there but a longer stay might have been awkward good location good staff our room was small moist and very cold the bathroom was cold had no bath tub and the paint on the walls were worn down the view was non existent the bar and the lobby is beautiful the staff is super nice and very helpful they provide information take requests and makes sure you have everything you need the rooms are very small if your used to big american hotels this will shock you but for london it s what to be expected the bed was genuinely a bit small to be called a double though will be staying here again but will pay extra for bigger room bed location was perfect for everything queensway tube is really close and the central line takes you anywhere you need to go the hotel is a very short walk to kensington palace gardens and hyde park room was clean staff were very friendly and helpful wish we were there for longer it was over too quickly really grand and impressive building it had the wow factor luanne and ankhur were fantastic really made our trip special they upgraded us for a special anniversary and clearly wanted to ensure our stay was perfect excellent location really close to hyde park and free weekend parking no congestion charge at the weekend either i have booked a superior double room at grand royale what i have got was a two class single room in a bed and breakfast location called shaftesbury hyde park international this is a bed breakfast location without any comfort the room was a single not a double room not very clean so small that i was unable to open my suitcase the heating system was off and the stuff needed two hours to put on the heating system so i have booked a superior double room at grand royale london hyde park a four stars hotel what i and another couple have got was a second standard bed breakfast two stars single room in a bed breakfast location in the same street this for a proice for a four stars hotel this is an illegal practice of the hotel which should have consequences no positive window in the room didn t open bed was much too soft the heating went on in the middle of the night we were boiling didn t sleep at all the architecture of the building inside and out was lovely they offered to change rooms for us they paid our taxi to the train station no negative clean comfortable light airy room hotel is a beautiful piece of history with the thearter bar the staff extremely helpful and friendly it was our wedding anniversary and made more special with chocolates wine fruit left in our room for us     cleaner was smoking in hallway office leaking into hallway and room a little a bit old fashioned particulalry lounge areas need updating would like more food restaurant options good location for my needs reasonably comfortable and clean they upgraded me to a club room which was a bit bigger but not big close to park for running quiet location easy access to transport and local shopsno negative the staff were on hand     to help with travel directions using hotel facilities etc location is perfect   minute walk from subway and in a really nice area room was a little small but very clean the room was very small very and it was a dusty the breakfast was a little expensive but very plentiful the neighborhood is fantastic we especially loved the champion pub and little persia rooms very small first room we were shown had a flight of stairs just inside the door extremely dangerous extremely friendly and helpful staff ideal location for bayswater and queensway stations   minutes walk from hyde park the room we expected was not available alternative was small cramped and noisy with outlook over dirty buildings described as superior deluxe not in our view comfortable bed friendly and helpful staff no one pointed out where the bar area was in case wanted a drink before going out not even sure if there was one one equally no one pointed to us where the restaurant was to see if we could be tempted to eat in so not a real negative just a missed opportunity location cleanliness room was small alright for a single person but tough to share there was a desk with a chair i could not use because it was tight against the bed recent remodeling in the room clean and new bathroom with decent amenities the hotel has maintained the public areas with the original decor adds character and a little bit of history dust behind bed on carpet hotel full of character and history staff so professional and accommodating delicious breakfast in a beautiful dining room hotel really more suited to adults no negative struggle with this one fell up step as i entered the room so not a good start i appreciate it s an old building but the creaking floorboards drove us crazy especially at three am when above us arrived back to there room i didn t sleep bed too small too noisy too hot however couldn t open windows we were told breakfast slot at  am however no room so we sat in the bar waited to be called we weren t i prompted the waitresses a few times overall i was dissapoted the staff wouldn t let my boss his guests vacate the hotel until they had paid for breakfast which i had arranged to settle using the corporate credit card the staff said they couldn t take payment over the phone useless no positive the room was cold at the window had to pull a curtain between the bed area and the sitting area there was no heating in that area would not stay in this room againno positive however i was not aware that my room would be so small and in the basement of the hotel there were no photos of such small rooms on website main area inc reception lovely and reflective of photos the size of the room and taking the     out of our account to put it back in   days later staff knocking on the door at     to say you are checking out today the breakfast was quite good and reasonably priced everything else very poor value for money the bathroom was so small that my friend and i who both have mobility problems dare not use the bath or shower in case we could not get out again we were told that we had an upgrade to a larger room how small would the other room have been would never go there again the bed was comfy there was nothing we disliked this hotel was fantastic i even asked for a large mug as i drink lots of herbal tea they found one in staff room the location is first class amble down qeensway early evening very eclectic and vibrant we seen every sight there is to see and more within a   to   tube ride gave us an upgrade as we were on honeymoon now please remember its bang in the centre of the area you need to be i have seen comments about room sizes being to small remember it s central london the room was great shower brilliant a large head shower can t say enough good things about the property or staff   plus the decor stunning i am in the travel industry this is the best at the best you will find so read this then hit book no money upfront either in case your itinerary changes thank you for a wonderful   days oh buy an oyster card     per day unlimited travel tubes and buses i am a frequent traveling and this is unfortunately the worst hotel i have ever stayed in extremely small room one way in and one way out floor in reception area needs lots of love misleading based on images shown on the website wifi was miserable absolutely nothing we usually book a delux or club room at this hotel but our funds were a bit tighter for this visit so we booked a superior standard room it was adequate for just going to bed in however the bathroom which only had a shower cubicle some have baths with built in baths our bathroom was ridiculously small no elbow room at all there was significant corrosion under the sink on the fittings and the wall was pitted beneath one of the switches in the bedroom area the heater was effective but very noisy and our window was rather drafty our room was to the rear of the hotel and by  am we could hear the faint sound of the tube station below the hotel even on the  rd floor been to this hotel several times before its our favourite place to stay on london the hotel is an old terrace building with beautiful iron work details on the exteriors and gorgeous mahogany staircases and marble fireplaces the breakfast is of an excellent quality and has fantastic choice from full english buffet to cheese salad and salmon as well as continental selection the staff are always well presented polite and service is exceptional it is a short     minute walk from queensway tube station central line so is perfectly lovated next to hyde park and is close the oxford st hammersmith and shepherds bush as well as notting hill westminister is less than   mins away via the tube queensway tube station has   small set of stairs to and from the platform to the upper floor then there is a lift to the ticket hall so if you have luggage its not too many stairs to lift your cases inadequate heating had to move three times shower didn t drain properly cleanliness evidence of previous occupant left on floor location style and history pleasant staff the staff are welcoming and happy english needs a tad refining food was all totally perfect fresh tasty not being sitting around drying out or overcooked we were all most impressed we had all just come back from trips to france scandinavia denmark and copenhagen this hotel far exceeded our expectations the staff are really attentive and on the ball room a little warm we didn t manage to figure out the aircon but we opened the windows anyway lovely rooms good breakfast excellent area and friendly and polite staff would stay again the room was a bit small it was really clean and all but a bit old the location was simply excellent the hotel is close to a major metro line and you can reach any part of the city easily the staff was as well exceptionally kind and helpful loved the hotel style old english style unfortunately there was roadworks just outside our window so we were woken up rather early saturday morning by construction machines but once we shut the window we couldn t hear them room was also on the small side it was more cosy as opposed to spacious and luxury great location superbly helpful staff they provide a computer and printer so i was able to print off my boarding passes easily room was very clean and bed comfortable didn t dine at the hotel but the afternoon tea looked amazing will try it next time just opposite hyde park and next to the tube station however we walked as weather was nice and it only took us   minutes to walk to victoria apollo theatre to watch the show i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be central but also in a nice and peaceful location saturday morning walking through hyde park was picturesque also staff offer city maps and guides or any personal recommendations for those who don t know london very well the foyer is beautiful very exquisite and grand in my opinion a very good value for money hotel would ve paid twice that i paid for our stay was a great place to show my partner what london has to offer the grand royale had an issue with the water boiler so we were moved to the shaftesbury hyde park just down the road we were upgraded and had breakfast included because of the inconvenience the staff at the shp were very helpful staff were very helpfulno negative when we explained we were celebrating a birthday we were upgraded presented with wine a fruit basket and chocolates absolutely amazing hotel and staff will return soon bathroom extremely small bedroom was small wall where case stand was very scruffy and marked beautiful foyer but dusty was told i would be contacted by manager but wasn t bed very comfy location good for our purposeno negative the hotel more than met our requirements for our   night stay we had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of   as it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean the bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting we also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit the reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful finally the location is a real bonus as there are   tube stops within   minutes walk hyde park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops however if you don t mind a walk then the west end is about   minutes way on foot we also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the lily langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special room was very very small and dark with only a tiny window to a dark backyard historical interiour nice bar and entrance hall chocolate and fruit in the room the bed was not comfortable and the shower was near useless as it had no power fantastic staff so friendly and helpful the building was beautiful it was also my sons birthday and he recieved chocolates and cake the single room was a bit small but comfy i stayed on the  th floor but the elevator only went to the  th the property is centrally located very close to kensington park very small room noisy from above because of very creaky floorboards difficult drop off but mainly because of roadworks nearby parking costs reasonable for london no restaurant in hotel for dinner great decor excellent breakfast typical english decoration historical looking inside but modernised rooms we arrived to london at     am and we were supposed to have our room at   oo m therooms were not ready and they gave us something else at the reception there was a male person who was very good and helpfull he was the person who we cold trust he really knew things and had a long experience the furniture in the room was a little worn the desk chair was leather but with a lot of slits and missing leather from it it just felt a little tatty i would also recommend extending the shower door protector screen out a bit further as using the shower to wash hair meant the bathroom got soaked no ironing board in the room though room ready on arrival late check out no problems with check in as had made pre payment bathroom modern and lovely nothing bad it was as described and can t fault our stay we had complimentary wine and fruit for a birthday in the room which was a lovely touch all the staff were very friendly and helpful room   was like a broom cupboard with a staircase above it from  am no sleep due to the noise but we were moved after an early trip to reception thank you the breakfast was amazing x we had to request a bedroom with a bathtub because most come with tiny little showers and the fridge wasn t very cold but these were both minor things the hotel was so beautiful walking in that i was shocked especially at the price we paid the service was that of a   star hotel and i was impressed with the lovely welcome we received the staff helped to carry our bags up gave us a snack and helped us choose the best room for our situation no negative seemed superior to other hotels of a similar price excellent location near to restaurants and underground stations the hotel has wonderful wood decor and comfortable lounges no negative i had a very pleasant staying the room was clean and offered everything i needed the building is beautiful personnel was very nice and helpful the position is extremely convenient room was on the small side but we didn t seem to notice much as we were in and out a lot and the rest of the hotel made up for it everything was great reception were very friendly and helpful had some cool little android thing in the room which was free to use and take out with you around london our room had this really bad odor in it the whole time you could barely move in there since the room is basicly to crowded with stuff but otherwise a good hotel the staff and the location club rooms are not as big as seen in pictures since we were out the whole day for sight seeing it didn t made much of an issue but it hard to fit in   big size bags property is nice and clean with victorian style interiors love the cozy rooms got a good deal via booking com we found our bedroom a club room with complimentary wine water fruit a little on the small side the bathroom was a bit cramped too however they were both clean so we shouldn t grumble we really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel with beautiful character from the outside of the building to the reception lobby area theatre lounge bar dining room which all reflected the timeless elegance of this   s building which was once the residence of lilly langtry the staff were super friendly helpful the location was perfect for us being close to tube stations making getting around so easy also being so close to hyde park kensington gardens was good too making a stroll in nice surrounding effortless nearby to the hotel there s a great selection of restaurants offering avarious worldwide cuisines a tesco express a sainbury s both being   minute walk away was handy too all in all a great stay in london with everything we needed at our fingertips feet we would stay here again was charged twice for room refund takes     days parking cost   and that wasn t mentioned anywhere when booking room was tiny didn t look like anything in the pictures location of hotel and bed comfy room nice actual hotel was nice there was no iron and ironing board in the room the coasters were cheap and flimsy the room we was first given had a steep stair case on entry which wasnt appealing bed was comfortbale the room clean and tidy with enough space for our things the bathroom has a contemporary look with modern features and even loo roll with valentines hearts air con worked well and fresh fruit and water was provided before we arrived breakfast was fantastic choices from english breakfast salmon salad vegetables fruit pastry and so on the quality was realmy good the room we had breakfast in was well decorated and added to our experience staff was also friendly and help me find a replacement room because i wasn t happy with the first unpleasant drain smell from shower which pervaded room so had to keep window open excellent customer service we had been moved from grand royale to this hotel due to maintenance issue good communication from hotel beforehand very comfortable room and full english breakfast provided free of charge for the inconvenience very small room difficult to move around hotel not very meticulously cleaned there were stains on the bathroom floor from the previous guests spider web on the ceiling corner very expensive for what it offers location not bad abt   minute relaxed walk to marble arch queensway tube station just around the corner lots of buses to all directions   minute away personell polite and professional was unable to connect my laptop to the wifi but it was working because i was able to connect my phone to it also the veiw but thats understandable the fact it was central to everywhere that i had to go also it was walking distance to two underground stations each with different lines going through them it was also close to some very nice restraunts and bars got there room didn t have not heating or hot water didn t have another room so put us in their sister hotel   mins away which isn t as good but still charged me same price not happy at all location the facade of the hotel was being repaired i understand that it had to be done but i would have liked to have seen it i must return the staff was very friendly and the free fruit and water in the lobby was a nice touch could not get access to wifi room was small for price for the value breakfast should have been included bathroom looked basic i have stayed in travel lodges that have better bedroom facilities staff and exterior of building basement view after being upgraded apparently room was a little small or compact as they advertise them all pretty standard free phone toiletteries and fruit bowl two minute walk from car park and tube station there was building work being carried out and scaffolding complimentary wine fruit and chocs lovely touch near tube to get around but in a quiet area rooms a little on the small side bathroom even more so in fact it was so small you had to go outside to change your mind friendly welcome stunning interiors nice quiet room so we had a good night s sleep we found the location to be ideal and the parking very nearby be careful about road construction around as it may impact your travel time by taxi location close to hyde park makes it a perfect spot for running staff is always ready to help and show great care this fully refurbished with modern comfort whilst they keep the historical london touch at reception great choice it definitely needs renovation room sizes were really small didnt seem worth the money or star rating we were disappointed location close to public parking and the metro station we were told after our stay that our breakfast could ve been free if we d book directly through the hotel website we paid about   euros a morning for breakfast for   mornings staff were extrememly helpful and polite room was a little cramped but cozy loved that we had a bathtub to soak in after being out in the cold all day do not stay in room   tucked away in a dingy basement with no view it was plagued by a the frequent rumbling of underground trains from     am and b a random outside light switching itself on and off at regular intervalsno positive the rooms while clean are small the location to kensington palace and hyde park is fantastic with bayswater and queensway tube stations a two minute stroll no negative had a club room on the lower ground floor room had been recently renovated so was very nice and modern room was quiet and warm and had coffee tea hot chocolate making facilities staff were friendly and stored baggage for me couldn t really fault anything with this hotel i d stay here again thanks grand royale no negative the location is fantastic right next to the park and very close to   tube stations staff were very friendly and helpful hotel was very historic grand and beautiful the most small uncomfortable bed we have ever experienced for a double room along with the small room and a bathroom that was that small my head hit the ceiling in the showers and you had to climb down the side of the toilet to close the bathroom door to get to the sink and have privacy the position of the hotel is great only   minutes away from two tube stations to get you around london and kensington park right across the road lot of building works and bteakfasr quite expensive at     for a   year old staff were amazing couldn t help you enough it s a shame we were not pre warned of extensive renovation work to the hotel upon booking though enjoy a lovely breakfast in the bar upon request the breakfast room was very busy and noisy as the main restaurant was closed for building works rooms needing a bit of tlc as older but beds were extremely comfy bathroom was compact but very nice bath and facilities and our club room was huge i recommend here for a short stay the room was tiny looked over the back of the hotel it was really noisy early in the morning because of the bin men the bed was very small too soft clean bathroom bedroom far too small and difficult to move around bed shower screen too small which meant we had to use towels to wipe toilet seat and floor dry location very good staff very friendly enjoyed reading about history of building we had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in   also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but   days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take   days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this the bar and reception was very nice the hotel wants to position itself somehow in the upscale but it s not up to that and fails ending up being awkwardly in the average where in facts its real positioning is awesome location nearby the tube and the park hyde park if you fancy some jogging in the morning also the room although tiny was super clean and comfy the view was terrible an alley with skips and rubbish it was covered by broken blinds taped to the window fire alarm at    am no one came to tell us it was false alarm or to apologise for the inconvenience staff just took payment don t do anything else like ask how was stay etc the decor in the entrance lobby was nice tiny room small bed dirty toilet upon arrival dirty walls from scraches small menu for in room dining no slippers and bathrobes in the room they brought them after my call old room needs renovation friendliness of the reception staff the room was very small for two persons the bed very small the bathroom is not existing the location is perfect close to the tube and in the very center i have to attend breakfast is excellent the room was supposed to be a double superior but not big enough for one too small not easy to negotiate with stairs to the toilet the bathroom too small had negotiate round the basin to gain access to shower too small very uncomfortable very clean could be more selection on the food menu very accommodating fast room service and good speed internet   mins from central line tube which was perfect room size was much bigger than standard central london size the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and therefor there were areas closed and sealed off there was demolition signs and danger signs all over there was scaffolding up all over the front of the hotel the room wasn t clean the bed was stained and ripped the carpets were stained and there was damp on the walls a very disappointing stayno positive basement corridors could do with repainting floors in reception need redoing location great friendly and helpful staff hotel not   star debatable if   star however the photographer used to photo hotel was definitely   star bed very basic shower tiny towel almost sandpaper nice bar but the barman wasn t very friendly on the edge of hyde park and minutes from queensway tube station means an ideal location plenty of character and breakfast is excellent some of the towels and sheets were not changed due to my stay there were few marks on bedding so wasn t replaced they had some issues at bayswater grand royal so placed me in paddington one was lovely room friendly service nice shower really enjoyed i thought the dullness in the reception area gave a poor first impression lovely building so lets see it staff were really helpful room spotless breakfast brilliant on arrival at     at night no room was available despite having rung and confirmed the previous day and we were sent to a tiny room in an inferior hotel this is the second time this has happened me with this hotel group this is totally unacceptable particularly with a short break when time is valuable no positive y we like the hotel and the staff were very helpful we did have a complaint and it was put right the management went out of there way to make sure we had a good stay and that we were happy the rooms were very comfortable and breakfast was very excellent nothing was to much trouble to them an very enjoyable stay due to restoration of the building the restaurant was not open although there is no shortage of restaurants and bars near by we loved the look and feel of this historic building its in a great location with lots of choice of restaurants the staff were very friendly and as it was my birthday whilst visiting they kindly put a bottle of wine balloon cake and box of chocolate in room to make the stay even more enjoyable bed a bit too hard and pillows a bit too big but that is just our preference everything you need in the bedroom and bathroom for a perfect stay wonderful breakfast great location rooms facing the back were a bit noisy probably because of the external units of the air conditioning but it was manageable rooms are rather small but this is common for london comfortable double bed very clean room and bathroom professional and helpful staff excellent location just opposite hyde park and very close to the central line of the tube queensway the closest station   minute walk from the hotel   minute walk from paddington station complimentary coffee and tea in the room regular size bathtub rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited   minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned awayno positive room was very small didn t look like the photos and there was construction going on during our stay which we weren t aware of loved the staff quite cool in the reception area needs heating or an open fire to compliment the building no hot water for a shower on the evening or the following morning staff were very very good and issue with the above was resolved but put a dampener on the trip location in a quiet street location to the tube and local shops rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day bed was v comfortable staff v helpful the rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom and for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and i felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from honestly i was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to london for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this i definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small not sure if i may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a   poster bed which when i purchased the superior double room i expected to get and if what i got was a superior double room i would like to see how big a suite is another point would be the view i wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however the view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better one rude female member of staff at reception see first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout london however it is here i am almost   sure that i booked the hotel room and i received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff i previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay   each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing i wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the london eye or houses of parliament and the thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful the bathroom was very nice and well kept the male staff were very helpful at front desk at night and so were the general staff that helped carry your luggage they were very kind and helpful however there was a down side to the staff as they were let down by one female member of staff who i thought was quite rude in her mannerisms and the way she spoke and definitely needs to either try and enjoy her job or find a new one honestly working can be crap and boring but get over it we all have to work however not to discourage the other female receptionist who checked us out as she was very helpful and friendly the photos are enhanced on the internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if i m honest a bit dreary from outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of windows it needs sensitively being freshened up throughout the decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded we had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely i wouldnt stay again location was very good as we could walk from paddington station with our overnight bag the staff are very good and friendly and efficient nothing too much trouble did not eat there so can t comment on this sorry tea and coffee and extras in the room were very good nice big tv and enough towels provided controllable heat for room was good too unfortunately the hotel had boiler problems and we were move to another in their group the grand park paddington     devonshire place which was not where we wanted to be no positive the room was very very small so a couple with   medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room the breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast i would expect a little a bit more than that the hotel is in a fantastic location both by tube bus as well as walking from the heart of the city the room was clean and the stuff friendly the best thing about this hotel is that it is quite and in a fantastic location value for money for sure room was a club double but a little small the issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so i endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one service and location both excellent hotel was a beautiful building we did not eat at hotel but bar and dining room looked very inviting we had an issue with the room and it was not possible to resolve it in time but we were offered and accepted a complimentary taxi to our train station club rooms slightly small especially shower toilet smaller than expected very friendly staff liked the premises and location very clean enjoyed the quaint bar nothing the rooms are compact which is not unusual for london they were however well kept clean and modern with everything you need it s perfectly placed for exploring london s tourist attractions one thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait   minutes walk from kensignton park and hyde park about   minutes walk from the main shops at oxford street staff all very friendly different restaurants and shops in the street behind the hotel hotel is dated hallways are marred and marked with luggage collisions construction in progress on the entrance side of the building room was neat and clean beds were comfortable tv with lots of channels tea with percolator provided and some snacks best is the location lots of different type of restaurants close by favorite for breakfast was la roma a small boutique restaurant located just around the corner great breakfast and lunch very easy access to underground bedrooms very small but ok also when renovations complete i would think the hotel will be even better fantastic location beautiful hotel breakfast excellent room was tiny designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in little more than   inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous  g loan phone provided with the room was really useful had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though i had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side lovely hotel great to look out on to hyde park and walk through to the centre of london staff are polite but don t have authority to rectify things just explain politely that is policy the layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly the location was ideal being very close to a tube station also being close to hyde park if you like walking the staff were friendly and helpful we had the chocolate and prosecco afternoon tea which was very tasty they were renovating at xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together we had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower i was very disappointed the old england style of the hotel i was transferred from the original hotel i booked they couldn t provide a twin bed and i asked for a room with windows instead i was given a basement room they complementary phone didn t work good location dont go here if you like to spend time on your room go here if you sleep in the hotel and you re out the whole day a lot on walking distance if you re a walker otherwise two underground stations within   minutes walk nothing in particular room a little on the cool side but not uncomfortably so some of the decorations a little on the tired side but this is an old traditional property would recommend and have no hesitation in staying again quirky hotel full of character from the past loved the bar especially the memories of lily langtree friendly and helpful staff great location opposite hyde park and a couple of minutes from nearest tube station no negative great location close to two tube stations tasty and fresh breakfast good service only the bathroom and shower was too small to feel super comfortable other than that perfect hotel for a stay in london the overall look of the hotel was a bit neglected the picture on the web did not reflect the image the staff tried to help but some feel short where as some went beyond say what you mean do as you say the room was okay the staff was helpful the front desk was okay ordered a taxi from reception and they they did not know where they were going abd had not hear of the ritz do not order uber cabs for guests friendly man on reception the reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel with the exception of an asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people the location extremely cheap in comparison for the level of comfort location room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced good location very close to hyde park underground cafes and shops what they call a double bed could even fit     year old adults in dent in middle of matress fire alarm went off both rooms we had were so cold and drafty the whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down the hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid i have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary no positive the room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose we only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners i asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still hairs on the bed so had to shake it off went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel will not be going back to this hotel free wifi and honest when i miss laid my watch when i moved from our hotel room the hotel moved me partner with no problems into another room staff was polite and friendly on check in and out i didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc location staff was very nice and helpful bar was nice but wished they had a restaurant beyond breakfast the room was very small thi s made it difficult to walk around the bed without catching your leg on the bedroom furniture staff were very good breakfast good the hotel environment was excellent and once the refurbishment is complete it will be evan better there was mould around the bath the bath wasn t clean there was someone else s hair all around it the breakfast was amazing and the bed was very comfortable the staff was very polite getting to the hotel was very easy they are renovating also a good thing ofcourse but the staff did everything to please us location at the parc staff and bell boys are really friendly nice old typical english building room size we were upgraded to club room which was one of the larger room sizes this room was still very small incl the bathroom exercise care when selecting room size good location for hyde park and central line tube station to west end less than   mins walk rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more difficult to pull my luggage in staff was accommodating esp when i had super late check in without informing them beforehand beautiful lobby and dining hall sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly bathroom could have been a bit bigger the old fashioned interior and the helpfulness of the staff no need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me warm comfortable room very polite and helpful staff near tube bus quiet it was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space overnight it was very cold we asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it no positive the london weather the staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinly friendly looking after us in a fantastic way the hotel is very centrally locatef to all the main attractions having   tube stations witjin   min walking distance there are plenty of shops and tasty restaurants all around the hotel the room was tiny it was so disappointing considering i booked a superior room as soon as you opened the door there was   steps leading up to the room there is approx a foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel location was good right around the corner to two different tube stations about     minutes walk with access to the central district and circle lines across the road from hyde park kensington gardens staff were friendly and helpful bed was comfortable and good bathroom facilities no negative it was exquisite beautiful room was a little small and shower room tiny i think you might have problems with it if you re any bigger than a size   overall though fabulous location for birthday celebrations room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback beautiful hotel with great late  th century decor helpful staff recently renovated comfortable bed roomy bathroom great location tube stop just a block away nearby commercial street with plenty of restaurants the room we were in was small compared to other hotels we have stayed in also mentioned to reception as i left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process bed comfortable only used the room no other facilities location good bus nearby straight to oxford street and elsewhere the hotel rooms are quite small they were clean but in need of decoration the entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate we didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on   different floors we booked these rooms over   months in advance we were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed i would not rate this hotel as a   star it s a   in my opinion no positive felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped i would not of paid the price we did for the room if i had seen it before hand i feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of   would never use this chain of hotels again hotel was clean and complementary breakfast was given due to the inconvenience of having to move hotel bed was too small and the property was loud this was the only property i used a debit card in and on return to the us someone in the uk area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash not recommended no positive view from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing bar area is excellent barman looked lonely though hire him a friend staff on desk very helpful lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that very close to subway friendly staff the room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really the window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy but my main gripe is that on arriving i was told i have to provide a credit card i didn t have the same card on me as i booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount when i got home i noticed that i had been charged twice and i phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take   days for the money to be returned to my account it would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues the bath was lovely great having a decent bath with central tap the room was clean and the hotel was in a good location very basic and ungenerous place without feeling having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper staff member dimmed lighting at     pm really rude towels grey instead of white bedding low quality you just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap location shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler extremely friendly knowledgeable and helpful staff from restaurant recommendations to booking cabs a big plus the room was absolutely tiny the smallest i ve ever stayed in my boyfriend is     and they put us in a room in under the eaves the night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested mtv was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or   star status we were also not informed of the renovation works being done the whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas the building work outside woke us up at about    am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough our stay was not that of a four star hotel we liked the cleanliness of the room and valeria who checked us in scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit beautiful hotel clean tidy breakfast although extra was outstanding complimentary extras were a lovely touch we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark the rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on  nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins however the rooms we moved to in the basement   and   were much more spacious all the staff were fantastic courteous polite and extremely helpful they offered us complimentary breakfast and upgraded us to club rooms then upgraded us again to larger rooms they went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay for mum s  th birthday the building is beautiful and full of character the location is great a stones throw from kensington gardens palace and hyde park when we arrive the hotel we   rooms for   nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about     months in advance we were very disappointed it was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station none no tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff the hotel staff made our stay very very good my wife i were celebrating my  th birthday the hotel gave us chocolates and wine to help us celebrate a very nice touch thank you all we were first shown room   which was so small it should only be listed as a single certainly not as a double but we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better so i cannot fault the service the bathrooms are fabulous best i have ever seen however the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas the bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there we came back in at around     pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area others came in later and had to stand unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed which is a shame as it is a beautiful building all in all a nice stay but not a great one room was very acceptable with nice touches although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it this was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again the staff were extremely polite and helpful the single rooms although small were very well equipped modern and clean i had the best experience ever thank you i was standing near bond street station by the traffic lights contemplating whether to travel back home to luton or stay a night as i only had to travel back the next day for training the booking was easy and within half hour of me booking i was in my room it was the best process ever for me that day i was very comfortable the staff were great because they interacted with me and noticed that i had stayed there before with that i was given an upgrade as you could imagine in my head bonus my day is getting better it s a great location for leisure of business small rooms confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems offered me to stay at a hotel nearby after   mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel excellent location clean the only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed so we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate the bathroom was small but had a bath the room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best they never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter the check in process was a pain we arrived at     so   minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready that was ok and we decided to wait in the hall no one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after   minutes i had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else when we finally got the key   minutes later we had to wait another   minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for london the hotel is located   minutes away from   underground stations so it s very convenient it s perfect for a stroll in hyde park as well as you just need to cross the road the hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie we had a club room and it was quite small it had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow the bed was small but very comfortable small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy the staff are amazing very attentive and very knowledgable the fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller grand royale hotel the breakfast that we had to make up for being sent somewhere else room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing this hotel is not for us great location to hyde park and tube stations beautiful reception areas and staff welcoming shower was great and large wardrobe space wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half   at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel on arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the tvs were shut down with no signal on the screen totally dissapointed i made sure staff where aware on our last morning i took it upon myself when i got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since september had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing avoid breakfast was nice booked in october for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in january it was around   cheaper staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom back of bathroom door was very dirty very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel location see above window looking out on the rough side room was very clean comfortable although a little on the small side the only negative would be that the outside was off putting with scaffolding close to all the shops and travel stations would stay again there was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot the location of the hotel was just right for us building work under way but was not informed when we booked for food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor location and the staff are very good breakfast ok initially we stayed in room   we couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes it seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise however to credit the hotel when i complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect excellent central location very professional courteous staff breakfast buffet was great the room was tiny and not enough storage for   suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room reception was always busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating its proximity to central line was exceptional the room was not cleaned properly the tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned not very thorough the bed comfy and staff pleasant and friendly we were upgraded to a bigger room for free the attitude of the staff during the check in the assumption that i wanted two single beds even though i booked a double room how the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple so called technical problem with the room i wouldn t recommend staying here no positive even though im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving as this is our honeymoon and we had advised when we booked we were pleasantly surprised to have a gift basket of fruit and a box of chocolates on the bed when we arived room not very big limited space between bed and wall small wardrobe front of the building covered because of repair great breakfast excellent location nice building free smartphone with internet available which is super convenient for foreigner great bathroom probably the smallest double i have ever stayed in if this was a superior double i would hate to see a standard room i couldn t use the safe as there wasn t enough room to open it location was good we arrived at     and our room was still not ready so we waited in the bar for   minutes until our room was ready which delayed what we were doing that day by over an hour no positiveno negative the location is good near hyde park and quinsway and bayswater metro stations the hotel is good but could have been better you can find a lot of restaurants and coffee shops around within   min walk room was super small very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside very uncomfortable bed decent location but not for us as we thought we would be closer to winter wonderland when we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had we said no we had booked this room   months ago at the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the  th floor the rooms are very small the hotel was near the metro renovated bathroom very clean coffee machine in the room comfortable bed rooms were too warm at times the bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet shower was extremely small with very low water pressure close to shops and   tube stations the first room the gave which it was on the  th floor its was like a grave and not even a room it was really shocking then they moved me to the basement which it was a bit better room it was no   but the  st room i didn t recall what number was it the rooms are very very small so i can t eve walk in the room the bathroom was tiny the d cor was good staff were friendly and the room was comfortable the stay consisted of myself and a friend just for one night we didn t have breakfast at the hotel so i wouldn t be able to comment on the food quality the hotel was perfectly located to get to winter wonderland in hyde park a short cab ride or   minute walk the room was so small for   people we had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable the property was beautiful we stayed right before christmas and it was just so cosy warm and beautiful inside really close to the tube so very convinient i don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel i would definitely return the room was tastefully furnished and very quiet i particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold christmas period the windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in england with kensington gardens literally   minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again location is excellent surly unhelpful staff and no room available reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability frankly told lies most unhelpful would never go near the place againno positive the hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view had i been informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room i would of looked for an alternative property for our stay this was disappointing as it was a special evening i booked for my wife as a surprise breakfast was good quality and fresh property is not quite a   since it needs some renovation no mini bar in the room great wifi good breakfast nice friendly staff great restaurants nearby rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs staff was extremely polite welcoming and friendly english breakfast was really good excellent location in between queensway and bayswater metro station my room was tiny had to shuffle sideways around the bed the bath bathroom were tiny felt i d paid to stay in a cupboard we will never go back there didn t eat there no water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork no offer of compensation or change of accommodation found nibbled biscuit on floor delux double very basic with view of scaffolding no response from hotel despite   emails to manager very disappointing experience entrance hall and bar attractive some rooms are tiny no room for big luggage or movement or without a window towels could have been bigger and there are no robes or sleepers no ventilation in the bathroom and the waters were running out from the bath  m from queensway station and  m from bayswater station renovated rooms with new wc and shower bath very comfortable beds very friendly and helpful staff the room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case feel like   odd was a bit steep for a small room shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped the hotel staff were excellent and the bed was very comfortable like the idea of the portable handy phone very homely place would defo come back if slightly cheaper the double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap complimentary bottled water is given on  st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that i have stayed the plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and queensway there are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice no negative the beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed the staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again the room aren t that great the pipes makes a lot of noise during the night which didn t make us sleep really well the staff was excellent from the reception to the restaurant really rich breakfast the room was very cold the radiator did not work the tvs channels didn t work the front door did not lock a lot of the switches in the room didn t work i asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later leaving my boyfriend and i wanted to spend a special christmas in london and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish london hotel the room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised it was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the   s or something the breakfast was   pounds per person which is ridiculous the staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare the bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks overall i was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel our room looked straight out of a motel   and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move this was not a supposedly a   star grand royale hotel i will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in london for the amount we paid we expected a lot more its not as advertised the lobby was beautiful our room was in the attic i think it was very small indeed however we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally room a little tired and should really be sold as a single typical old london hotel looking a bit tired from former glory days first floor reception area has a nice homely feel and staff were pleasant and efficient the price was right and we didn t look much further you don t mess around in london over christmas the superior double room was small there were no bedroom slippers n toothbrushes the cloak cabinet were tiny like a budget hotel there is no space for large luggages there is no fridge as compared to the twin which has a fridge complimentary bottled water given during check in but not for subsequent days of stay the location is nearby   train stations queensway and bays water there were lots of eateries nearby the place was nothing like the picture on the website we requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket after they put it together we didn t fit the room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable i didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but i regret not spending   more ando going to a better place the location especially the proximity to the park the room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable excellent location near hyde park queensway little shops and restaurants rail stations hotel itself nice and quaint tiny rooms old and smelly having work done inside and on the front which wasn t aware of when booked so appearance wasn t great didn t like the stay the staff are so lovely and friendly restaurant to serve meals rather than just sandwiches ice creams were advertised as ben and jerrys but were a different less well known make value for money friendly staff and location the free fruit wine and soft drinks in room especially the fruit upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty i would say a rating of     at most such a shame as staff were so nice no positive i didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk we he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets the hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us the police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally i wouldn t recommend the hotel i had saved to take my boyfriend to london the location was very good and was the best part of staying there was able to get my boyfriend to the winterwonderland nothing negative to say everything was beyond expectations have stayed there before and will definitely make it my first choice again highly recommend we didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the metropolitan hotel this was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day in addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the grand royale the sister hotel did not meet our expectations either when we returned to the grand royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room all in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in london for two nights we were compensated for the inconvenience caused by the defective boiler on the second day of our stay by getting a room upgrade the room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well not good value for money false advertising expensive for what you get no positive the staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less very disappointed and i m not normally one to complain no positive room was fairly cramped the shower screen was far too small water kept going all over the floor and the water wasn t actually on for the first few hours we were there the location was really good so close to the tube if we needed it but lovely walk through hype park if we weren t in a rush loved the handy phone really came in handy couldn t get a sit down breakfast in the resteraunt in the morning we had to perch on the small double in our room single glazing and noise from the street made for an uncomfortable night internet was intermittent the mobile phone inoperable receptionist the bellhop room was small and they gave me an upgrade bed comfy staff friendly nice bathroom nice area near hyde park i like hearing about the history of the hotel especially about how it was built for lily langtry the king s mistress and well known actress nothing the staff were very friendly and as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary the hotel made us feel very special the location was also very good as it was   minutes walk from a tube station and to the park there are two truths to this property s description yes it s in london yes it s on hyde park this is where it ends the grand royale is no hotel it is a hostel whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here the room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else staff was barely accommodating they state superior double room but not kidding it s a box size the  st room had no space on one side of bed a day was  ft space between foot of bed and wall we requested change they did but then  nd room smelt of damp so  rd time lucky staff were very helpful and nice would have been nice to have a ramp for our buggy and we had to leave our buggy at reception as it would not fit but that was ok the feel of the hotel the friendless of the staff and the location also the in room gifts unexpected and nice sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users dining g area only had   high chair which we had to wait for breakfast was nice not being informed of scaffolding outside and fireplaces blocked up with polythene there was even a delivery of toilet rolls heaped outside poor impression really bed was comfortable bathroom clean and refreshment facilities good the bed was too small we are used to kingsize and concequently we don t sleep too well it was a great location clean and friendly staff breakfast was good value too lifts rated as for   persons which could only accommodate   people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded but as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor the times gone by grandeur of the reception area and other public rooms this coupled with the ultra modern interiors of the bedroom to which we were upgraded as it was my wife s special birthday all the staff we encountered were pleasant and most helpful from the moment we arrived secure car parking available within a few hundred yards as was the london underground they had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in another couple walked in when we were having a nap not great room are tiny however i appreciate that goes with the territory in london location was good quite expensive from last time we stayed brother in laws room was cheaper that our by     and we had same room and staff could not tell us why nice hotel need a nice part of town room is a bit small you could hear people walking on the floor from the top room all the time staff however claimed that they would look into the matter excellet location close to pblic transportation staff was very polite and helpful hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station i cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site complimentary breakfast as hotel changed expensive breakfast small room and small bathroom our room was on the ground floor but we had to climb some stairs with our luggage and no elevator very good location extremely friendly staff old classic building but when we traveled it was in renovations so we could not see much of it quiet and friendly hotel the filthy sheer curtains in my room and the tiny night stands my view was pretty bad too also there was scaffolding on the building which couldn t be helped but destroyed the atmosphere the responses of the staff the bathroom was quite small the room was spacious the decor of the hotel outside the room was lovely particularly the carved staircase the bed was lovely and comfy the smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in i tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened no positive upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke stairs inside room to the bed room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do would not recommend this hotel hyde park location tube station proximity and good water pressure in shower bar area was musty smelling and the sauvignon blanc chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy two minute walk from tube small but perfectly formed bathroom plenty of fresh clean towels and ironing board arrived in a matter of minutes after being requested i could just about set the board up and iron my shirt without the need to kneel on my bed just for the price the room was a little small but it was only to sleep in so it didn t really matter the decoration of the hotel foyer was lovely and the paintings on the ceilings were fabulous being woken by housekeeping staff talking for ages and very loudly right outside our door even though do not disturb was on display beautiful old world charm of hotel club bar coffee good but such a strange room to call a bar its an internal room with no outside light old world charm friendly staff not told restaurant was being renovated or we had to book a table for breakfast so no room for us in the morning room very small and draughty no nice lobby lounge as on website as restaurant now there got charged for breakfast even though couldnt get in no positive staff failed to warn about building work and we were disturbed by banging above the fruit platter contained a mouldy plum and unripe pear comfy bed nice shower rooms very tiny and lower ground a bit like a rabbit warren staff very friendly and helpful location to hyde park brilliant and very close to   tube options the room is too smaller than which we see on the website especially in the bathroom i cannot even turn around the lobby s design and the staff there were really nice and quite warm hearted some gifts have been prepared for free like wine chocolates and fruits work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were tiny very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room there was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos the cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests the staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic they did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price the location was fantastic bar could have stayed open a little later staff really friendly and professional breakfast fantastic standard room a little small but clean modern and had everything you need the room was of poor quality asked to be moved the did to a room that was just as poor the area where the put me up bed was damp the wallpaper stained had not been cleaned throuher it was a mess waiting for the manager to contact me with no effect had to pay for breakfast when i booked with you breakfast was included i can go on an on the breakfast was nice just as well the first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in december isn t great they did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm i thought overall it was very expensive for what it was best thing about this hotel is definitely the location   minutes from the tube and right on kensington gardens which was fab the staff were friendly and when we did have a problem fixed it right away the value for place is absolutely ridiculous the price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received i would give this hotel  stars minus just for the location the hotel charged mi   pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for i have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details i like the location and probably the staff was trying to assist to accommodate mi in the hotel when three floor was out of order bedroom was the smallest i ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a club room god knows what the standard room size is like they accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine reception area has character but has scaffolding over the front of hotel at moment staff were friendly and attentive staff attempted to relocate due to maintenance issue but weren t prepared to pay for taxis staff were unhelpful waited   minutes for bags at departure and when asked they hadn t even given the ticket to the attendant scaffolding outside poor room was clean bed was comfortable we didn t appreciate the hotel trying a bait and switch on us they tried to get us to move to their sister hotel using the same spurious maintenance excuse they ve been using all year it seems after making a loud fuss at reception a room was miraculously available for us after all handy for hyde park grand royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard we had to ask to switch rooms as the tv didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed this hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates not much at all really no negative the hotel is quaint the room tiny location is good overall satisfactory but pricey especially as no breakfast is included a continental breakfast would do it was the worst experience i reached there   am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem they have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room they never contacted us or phoned to say anything moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy ac which we couldn t use to heat the room so it ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed no positive we booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room   was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and i had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than macdonalds restaurant there were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests friendly and helpful staff i imagine it is a nice hotel if you could access it all during our stay it was covered in scaffold and the whole first floor was out of bounds which includes the dining breakfast room my reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum i could say single superior and when i complain to the receptions they says hotel are full and no compensation was offered location good room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck room   right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn def not worth then money beautiful reception area and dining room friendly and helpful staff breakfast extra but nice with enough staff to keep on top of the tea coffee demand i had a sleepless night at this hotel the room   must have the air conditioning system outside it there was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through i won t be staying again location is the only thing this hotel has going for it the front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this we were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal the building has great charm the entrance and history along with the location the bed was very comfortable and the room was well stocked the staff were always happy to say hello and there were plenty of staff to offer assistance renovation works in parts of the hotel were perhaps an eyesore but this didn t stop us enjoying our stay the staff in reception were excellent helpful polite and went out of their way to make sure my husband and i had a wonderful overnight stay on our anniversary the room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in london we booked for a  th birthday weekend and had a great stay very friendly staff kind and generous gifts left in the room thank you spotless room with a very modern bathroom everything but the most shocking was the room i paid   for a room that didn t had nothing to do with what showed in the pic disappointed nothing the building was a under construction arrived to find hotel covered in scaffolding staff then lied and said it weren t there s even though it was blatantly surrounding their building no positive single rooms too many stairs items towel holders safes mirrors when foggy too high     people wardrobe unstable no headboard     loo roll need sliding door to ensuite not enough space dangerous at night location showers breakfast breakfast not being included within the fee shown st the time of booking the hotel suited our needs and met with our expectations the staff were very welcoming efficient and of a pleasant demeanour the hotel was clean and tidy and facilities in the room all worked rooms were a little small and the bathroom could have done with a bit of a clean very warm welcome from staff with an offer of an upgrade given email received from manager the day after we checked out which was a lovely touch the room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all there was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night not worth   for   nights at all and definitely not   we ended up staying at the paddington hotel as there were issues with the hot water here i ordered a bottle of prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by   minutes whilst this was organised then when i got to my room there was no bottle i had to call reception and wait   more minutes the pictures online make the rooms look much bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable a wonderful reception staff very helpful the room was clean and kept well stocked the location was great and the cost was in keeping with the amenities and locale the bathrooms were well stocked with everything you could need and the bed was comfy and getting was powerful the room was a little cold responsive heating but had to get out of bed to switch on room   window blinds did not move so could not see outside felt like in room without a window altho view was not good from the room nets or voile would have been better with working blind no positive the room was a little to small but we manged fine shower was perfect bed was cozy and each day all sheets were changed along with towels we were well looked after thank you if your looking for a place to rest after your long day this it nothing to comment that s right nothing at all very friendly staff beautiful hotel very accommodating will definitely stay again all round perfect stay had a slight problem with air conditioning but quick thinking staff came through with an electric fan was overwhelmed with the fruit basket delivered next morning couldn t ask for more the fact we got separated as a family we booked   double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across   levels and a mother and   kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overallno positive i didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem i was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which i had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it i like the location and the great restaurants nearby i read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how tiny it is until i saw it you literally cannot have   people walking around at the same time the staff are not fully informed about london and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist the room was clean with modern clean bathroom friendly staff great location the bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded loved the breakfast the quiet yet convenient location and the fascinating history of the place which is said to have been refurbished by edward vii as prince of wales for his actress mistress lille langtry the ornate public rooms are lovely as is the pocket sized theatre my room was cancelled they offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen the next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room no positive as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this staff really helpful clean and tidy there were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all location is excellent staff are lovely rooms are small but very cosy and adequate decor in main lobby is very victorian room service was only sandwiches although plenty of places to eat nearby the ambience and the rather quirky decor the rooms however are bright and modern bathroom was tiny shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around the room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk location was great staff was very helpful unlike every other hotel i have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website awful customer service i was waiting on the phone for   minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in no positive the building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty very than the pictures and various prices in different websites the location was great lock on bedroom door was broken exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc at checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite the room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available the upgrade was clearly a con we d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset the family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos the bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture it lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the windows the beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double when we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my     beer tab from the bill my wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated no restaurant or room service we were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked   staff were pleasant enough no positive the first room i was given was   which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and i could not sleep the staff were really helpful and when i asked for a change of room the staff did this instantly and i have a much better room in the basement section it wasn t the hotel i oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel then i find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused they had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there   nite stay and had excursions booked in the staff were ver good and friendly at arrival i was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room it had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size the lobby is depressing it seems to be from the queen victoria era the staff is very courteous and offer great attention we got upgraded to a club room lord knows what standard is like room   almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value bar closed at   and breakfast was a whopping   each we didn t have it reception staff helpful i had a superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small not great value for   per night bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing very little other than the location the room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner london to compensate we were within   minute walk to hyde park staff were great and when they realized we were celebrating our golden anniversary they prepared a surprise for us in our room which was lovely the hotel is grade   listed and has all the original features in the main rooms and the hotel has an interesting history rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly staff were really friendly location was great for morning runs in the park the bed was one of the most uncomfortable i have ever slept in and very small for a double good job only  ft   the bathroom was very small the shower was adequate but you could not turn in it the hotel was situated exactly where we wanted so an ideal location we didn t use any facilities and it was just a base however the staff were really friendly and professional the hotel was clean overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage bedding very poor and room very small even in the club rooms decor bland and dated the staff are very attentive extremely keen to ensure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable their interest appears very genuine and without exception the staff are this hotels greatest asset location adjacent to hyde park was lovely in the autumn the room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out ok location was excellent near hyde park the train underground and bus routes food was superb atmosphere was old english just as we d hoped the bed linen wasn t changed we were there for   nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy we were a   minute walking distance from the tube station and hyde park the rooms themselves were far below average extremely small with almost no room to move the lobby area and restaurant has beautiful old world decor the staff at check in were calm and helpful despite the huge line decor and condition of rooms dated and tired very small room but i guess it is london hotel bar very nice place to have a pre drink very friendly and helpful staff arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready ok so they had a problem won t hold that against them asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and i had upgraded to a so called club room taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny frankly if i hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre i would have found somewhere else the bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard the room was very small and there was no natural light windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area we were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but i don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller just labelling the door club room is meaningless my basic beef is that i paid extra for what i considered was a very basic room didn t have breakfast there after checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could i gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied sadly would not stay again booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience very clean though tiniest bathroom ever comfy bed some staff porters very friendly bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window it was also very uncomfortable everything was small shower area towels etc on arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel they left us alone rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard what sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at  am excellent wi fi the bed was comfortable the lobby is lovely but who sits in a lobby for long a huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration i booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with british charm and character what i discovered when i arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room this was not disclosed when i booked and i wouldn t have reserved if i had known in advance they requested full payment on my credit card when i checked in and i regret agreeing to that as i should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere so if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed i liked the location as it is very easy access to central london i have friends in the area so that made it convenient for us to get together tube stop is a minute away hotel is close to paddington station if you are coming in from heathrow and there are plenty of shops and services in the area as an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways they had a very comfortable bar lounge where i was able to have business meetings they were one tube stop from paddington station where the heathrow express terminates in london the staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost the staff and the room was fantastic i would like to stay again soon thanks avoid g floor i was in room   and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food i guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen not good for resting good location it is closed to queensway station and hyde park   mins to bond street and oxford circus indeed ideal for those who enjoy running either in the morning or afternoon small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart oh yes and no coat hangersno positive we couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse the bed linen was stinked rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it the four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by uk standards i will give it two stars location bathroom was very clean our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass very small room and very small bed considering that   people should slep in there no positive the room was absolutely tiny never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost   euro is awful first night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger location only scaffolding outside the whole building i paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available the hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor nothing see above they gave us complimentary wine and chops for husbands birthday but hotel dark dreary and building works at front of building and bar shuts at     hours bed was too soft location staff friendliness beautiful architecture of building inside room a little bit small not that we spent too much time in there price is bit high for the size of the room per say but considering its located in only   minutes from oxford street and its right next to hyde park its quite nice pricing they should have resupplied water on the second day as well no fridge available in the room no slippers provided breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical english style and it is rather subjective matter the location is exceptionally good you can rule out every cons just with the location only     minutes away from oxford street which is the main shopping area in london the place is very nice and calm the hotel provide with here mobile device that you can carry it around the city with you in which it provides unlimited data and local calls with many information about i could take it around the city and search the web including the map very clean traditional style hotel very warm nice staffs that speaks different languages we could keep our luggage behind the desk for free of charge until we get back to take off to airport tried to have a bath one of the evenings i m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing room was compact but very comfortable and quiet staff friendly and close to great transport into centre the room while clean and updated was very small i know that is not unusual in london but we were disappointed at that price point it was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open that s really our only complaint hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs good location especially for access to paddington station for the heathrow express also a short walk to notting hill and portobello road the night staff are lots of fun and provide great service angels overnight julian carlos claudio agnelo it being close to halloween count dracula was roaming the lobby and bar our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel thankfully they changed our room with no issue we had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl the stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed the old world look of the interior and the opera bar extremely small rooms look nothing like the picture if you take the lowest category you won t have any space left for your luggages some of the staff were rude other really nice no standards convenient location big queues so took a long time to check in room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal central clean good shower and bathroom comfy bed and just what i needed rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage bathroom was the tiniest i have ever seen hotel staff are very professional but nothing is too much trouble very attentive hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue when i said i reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if i did not like the new one they remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel no positive the location was not    miles from the venue i was attending there was scaffolding covering the front entrance the road was shared with several hostel type buildings they let a colleague check into my room without id and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker the room was clean and the bathroom was quite new some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark rich old wooden floors and moldings but fresh cleanly decorated rooms tiny of course delightful breakfast for just   pounds just a block to kensington gardens and hyde park restaurants all up and down within walking distance a     cab fare to most anywhere but we used the tube over two days and got around just fine we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar wonderful building great location excellent staff the twin room we shared was extremely small would have been suitable for single room there was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on the staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated the hotel was extremely interesting the d cor was beautiful with decorative stained glass windows and beautiful timber interiors the staff were helpful and friendly can t think of anything to complain about staff were really helpful and friendly ever such good value for money top tip would be book direct as same price only breakfast is included although they upgraded us to free breakfast rooms small but clean and comfortable the  st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them also getting to the hotel we paid a extra   for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us   for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking com and either the fact that the manger gave some money back as a good will gesture disabled access really needs improving great location and such a beautiful interior the historic connection added to the glamour too fabulous restaurants nearby and excellent transport links the building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings the rooms slightly too small location of the hotel was central the staff were very friendly and helpful hotel is clean and comfortable very welcoming atmosphere i had booked online and was informed i could pay at the property the hotel debited my account on the friday prior to my stay on the sunday which i wasn t overly concerned with as i had no plans to cancel on checking in they asked for the balance of the room i explained that the money had already been debited from account and i was told that it was just to hold the room and i would need to pay again so in theory i have paid twice for the room i have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within   days but this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again the rooms were nice and clean but very small   stairs straighr down into the room from the door if you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book beautiful building and charming staff excellent breakfast rooms are very old fashioned and small bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower the location we got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening the bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed the power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices i think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience location and proximity to tube and park the account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms the lift didn t work properly there was building work going on everywhere the place was dusty no positive the rooms could have been bigger the first room i was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing breakfast and toilet were very good housekeeping staff could do better job fridge and air con didn t work we only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now no good coffee shops close the service was faultless no negative staff extremely helpful friendly and professional facilities very good rooms somewhat small but modern and very clean photos a little misleading all looks larger in the photos very good value for money the room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception i liked the reception and the location the stuff were nice and the house keeping was very good room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut location was excellent close to the undrground easy walking to shopping district great bar and snack facilities staff excellent rooms were really small which was fine for one person but i would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult there s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway the location was amazing and super central to everything the cleanliness was fab and the staff were really nice they claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking they said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called grand royale and equally good but sent us off to shaftesbury hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night the second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room that hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast after much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the grand royale it appears that the grand royale london hyde park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel in my opinion they are confidence tricksters one guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason the hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms since i was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night they killed the joy and ruined our holiday no positiveno negative it is a beautiful hotel full of old charm and character beds comfortable showers hot wifi works well plus you receive a complimentary handy phone to use during your stay this can be taken with you around london and can be used for internet and local calls for free hotel vey close to underground stations and plenty of restaurants and shops around the corner on queensway to grab a bite to eat would highly recommend this hotel the hotel was having building work which was not advertised there wasn t noise but it wasn t as beautiful as expected due to the works the rooms were also very small the staff especially razvan on reception were friendly and extremely welcoming no negative being from australia we wanted a nineteenth century experience in a beautiful authentic olde world hotel it was all that the lily langtry theatre bar was outstandingly beautiful we had many gorgeous cocktails there amid the gilt and finery loved it although single rooms are small they are just enough and very comfortable the deep british bath was fabulous too we were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at  am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and i told them but never cleaned it the bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off free bottle of water and coffee and tea location and reception room very small hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it hotel was very modern and clean staff very polite and helpful great location the rooms are smaler then photos but is a national trust old building so it s worth it the location is great you have acces to hyde park within   minutes and you can find anything you need at the local shops the beds are very comfortable my requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room i booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom no positive staff disorganised trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke member of my team asked to change rooms due to room door not locking member of staff who assisted was very helpful pricey for what you get and bathroom could get cramped at times couldn t have a shower without flooding the room amazing location comfy and staff amazing the door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe the bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only  cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving  cm up the side of the bed we had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this i refused to pay any extra as i couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms no positive bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold wasn t really worth the money spent would stay somewhere else next time very close to the bayswater and queenbridge underground the staff was rude the air blew cool the first night but warm the second night the temperature outside was not low enough for heat when my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit i didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money i paid the staff needs more training don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place the location was close to eating places and public transportation bed was small i m     but was given what we think is the smallest room room in basement with no view and a noisy aircon outside nice building pleasant staff the room was very tiny i had to put my luggage on the bed to get my clothes the heater was not working near the tube station and walking distance to cafe resto and shops liked everything the bed was extra comfy cosy the staff were really helpful friendly the breakfast was delicious nice welcoming bottle of wine bowl of fruit we waited   minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready the guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed the employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly excellent location next to kensington gardens and a beautiful old building buffet breakfast was good and staff efficient when we had a problem with our room they upgraded us without our even having to ask the room and bathroom were very pleasant and all the staff were nice was building works and scaffolding one floor below us we really should have been informed when booking or checking in especially as the workmen started at     excellent location friendly staff the room was super small and the bed was not comfortable the manager was nice enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room but even that was too small to fit   adults and a one year old staff were super nice and the location was very close to the station and hyde park room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after i had stored it on check out since i had an evening flight otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception location is great when we arrive after a long day we were told that i had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room we informed we would have to pay for both rooms until i spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms but got sorted in the end also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads hotel was absolutely beautiful comfy bed and very pleased to have a bath in room service was fantastic location was amazing just near kensington palace and tube station   minutes away very happy with location and service will certainly book again luxury at the end of our trip before heading home the room was ridiculously small considering it was advertised as a superior double i couldn t find and information on what the hotel offered a tad run down and dirty the area a bit gritty but close to a tube station the bed was very comfortable all the staff excepting one were very pleasant the staff in the breakfast room exceptional book the club room which didn t feel like one the first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held   separate rooms the room was not well furnished despite the price paid one side of the mattress has collapsed i called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long  mins before i could address the change of my room i was told that it was the last room and i can t make any changes i was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap when i came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night thank god for the curtains the room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint i was too tired and upset to even request for another room change the staff which helped us changed our room and offered water when he saw that we were worn out from the change of room and the extreme long wait at the reception no negative cozy botique hotel clean rooms excellent location with easy access to tube queensway station and bayswater district line also very close to kensington park which is worth a visit exceptional service levels very helpful staff with smile on their faces helped me in booking a luxury cab till airport at very reasonable price the team has accommodated my request for an early check in by couple of hours super speed wifi i will surely stay back in this hotel and would strongly recommend for a comfortabl stay and pocket friendly prices booked a club size room and i must say it was a very decent size considering london room size standards loved overall experience keep up the good work team nothing love the hotel reception bar breakfast room staircase lovely and the room was extremly comfort clean and quiet though a bit small definitly re visiting again rooms are really quite small which is ok for a couple of days but if you are staying for an extensive period it can be an issue excellent staff and a great location beautiful hotel lobby and unique architecture no negative the courtesy shown by the team at the hotel for changing my room immediately as there was some problem with the wash basin and hence they gave us a better room as previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for london this is probably typical upgrading to a club room provides access to the club lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price we found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in london in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked   months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds upgrading to a club room provided us with a lounge area on the  th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean the location is excellent the hotel is within a   minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores the staff was very friendly and helpful no negative the location was fantastic a two minute walk to kensington gardens we felt very well located and had everything we needed nearby the staff was exceptional and extremely helpful and friendly we highly recommend rooms are small a bit of construction going on really good location for hyde park great reception team helpful porters clean linen and towels water coffee and hot chocolate supplied in club room bathroom size the hotel is rich in history and in great location for transportation food and entertainment the staff was very helpful the room itself was large for london and had ac but the bathroom was tiny and claustrophobic we were told all other floors had larger ones we would definitely stay there again but not in that room laundry was available just a   minute walk away no negative such a luxurious hotel with comfortable and stylish rooms that has it all the staff are amazing making you feel very special i really enjoyed my experience there again as it was my second time fantastic location too as it s next to hyde park and one street away from loads of eateries and superstores all huddled together in one place i had late check out and the staff came to the room asking to go out because was late and i dont know why start the fire alarm and only in my floor the rest of the hotel was without fire alarm the hotel is really nice and the location is perfect the staff was not as good and quick that i would have desired the breakfast was pretty good i wish the eggs were cooked a little longer it seems people in uk like their eggs runny due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property the staff was amazing they helped us with everything and anything the rooms were clean and the property was centeraly located the room they gave me   very small and have   stairs between the bathroom and the bed it should not be used and kept as storage they changed the room the second dayafter i told them i will leave no positiveno negative room was extremely tiny small double bed with barely room to get around it but the bed was clean and comfortable excellent staff and very convenient location hotel is under repair our room was in the lower ground floor with no natural light and was noisy the   nd room booked for our friends was rather small but being on  th floor they could see out of the window friendly staff good breakfast our room and bathroom and also the bed was very small for two people not even place to put the cloths or luggage when you entered into the room you had to be very careful not to fell down the stairs as the room was on a lower level than the corridor not very convenient when you opened the window you had depending where the wind came from probably food smell from all the restaurants around the room was clean and the staff very friendly and the breakfast was very nice also the location was good the bed is a bit hard the locations is perfect as it is close to restaurants groceries and tube stations four season restaurant is in a neighbors staffs are helpful size of the room was a bit small though for such location and money it s not a big deal very beautifully decorated entrance reception breakfast room and other common areas friendly and helpful staff great location in the city center though in a quite area where you have proper rest the size of the room was very small and i was in a club suite the staff were helpful and friendly and i could check in early and they gave me a late check out as was flying home that night so meant i didn t have to spend as long waiting at airport superior label for the room is a joke it was small with a standard size bed not a superior bathroom either the steps up to the main part of the room from the entrance came a a suprise no positive the room was very small with narrow stairs inside the room door leading up to the bed the floor was creaky and the walls were thin leading to noise from other rooms the bar is beautiful and the service there was great scaffolding around the building typically the room was perfect for a singel traveller but would have been small for two exec double room wifi unstable and signal weak in room wish for more coffee in the room and a minibar no minibar in room i loved the atmosphere in the grand r hotel historic deco and reception incredible charming i also really liked the fact that the staff changed my room straight away when i didn t like   view straight into concrete wall and gave me a nice room top floor   this room was cosy and warm with view of roof tops the porter was extremely helpful and nice too the rooms were incredibly small which was challenging for us travelling with a lot of luggage we were offered a club room but the extra space was minimal and the bathroom even smaller than in the standard lovely historic building in a great location close to central line tube and kensington gardens staff were polite and very helpful even storing luggage for us during an interrupted stay breakfast offered plenty of variety the smaller room is too small the exterior view is not great the building facade is great the entrance is great the reception staff are welcoming thanks for the room upgrade due to someone smoking in the original smaller room split level room with bathroom downstairs staff were courteous friendly and helpful walking distance to queenway and bayswater underground stations eateries and convenient stores within walking distance room size i expect a superior double to be superior to something not to be told that is the standard size in what i can only describe as a box room location room was smaller than depicted no room for a chair just a small stool for suitcase very tiny bathroom no space for an ironing board room meant for a double but only suitable for one person hotel was quiet bed comfortable superior double room was tiny difficult to get in and out of the room steps down with a suitcase also no room to walk around the bed bathroom also tiny bath with no screen so when showering the entire bathroom was a big puddle the two lifts are small and one was out of action so the working one was very busy we had a train to catch so gave up waiting and struggled with our suitcase down the stairs no positiveno negative i loved the history of its royal connection and the entrance hall reception is a period beauty it is elegant and a lovely cosy size its fabulous old world charm our room was deluxe and very special on arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from  pm great we thought that all fits with our plans however this relaxed feeling was short lived when we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took   minutes to process before we made it to the front only to be told the hotel was fully booked how we wondered could this be we d booked     months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed we were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within   minutes   minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up so far we had been well over an hour a further   minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront no positive i didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel the staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so i didn t know what was going onno positive the bathroom was fairly compact although useable the view from our window was of the windows of another part of the hotel but you can t have everything really friendly and helpful staff delicious sandwiches that we ordered from room service bed was comfy complimentary toiletries bathrobes slippers soft drinks bottle of wine and chocolates all made our stay feel more special we intend on coming back again very soon it was lovely the room was very small when i booked the room it was a deluxe single room but actually i could not move inside it the historical design of the hotel it was clean the service staff was excellent on arrival we were met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work they said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in   mins an hour and half later we were still waiting i asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in they agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small tv didn t have a remote to operate it either it definatley was not a four star room or experience we had to que   mins to get into the breakfast room when we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt they clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times worst hotel experience for us for a long time shame as we were there for my wife s birthday no positive the breakfast was too busy and we had to sit separately subsequently you were asking for coffee and items that were running out on the buffet the room   was excellent and all staff great in what was a busy weekend room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous room was in a very confined space with   steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and i am of reasonably small build comfortable bed great shower decent breakfast extra nice personable staff very atmospheric impressive reception bar dining areas the pictures of the hotel rooms bore little resemblance to the actual room in particular the size of the room they were exceptionally small to the point of being claustrophobic the hotel was very good in most respects and the staff tried to help as best they could breakfast was very good and there was plenty of choice it is our honey moon and we requested specials to our room nothing was being done for us extra small room for us while it says deluxe double room location very good lobby area very classic which we like there were problems on arrival with our rooms we were asked if we could move hotels we selected the location to walk into hyde park the next day then the rooms were confirmed but only one out of the two rooms was made available by  pm the staff were incredibly helpful and respectful the inconvenience was fully recompensed the breakfast was worth the money considering the convenience and the general cost to eat out in london we missed out on high tea on our last day we left it too late the night before but it was booked out by then so book it early location is great close to   tube stations lobby public areas lovely old world feel but rooms spacious very clean all requests followed up quickly with smiles beds very comfortable with a choice of pillows a four star hotel i don t think so just overpriced there was nothing special about it just four very thin walls and a bed lack of ambiance super small shower cabine my neighbor called home after midnight could hear his entire conversation glad we didn t stay for breakfast friendly staff rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room on asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid i would expect to pay in a yha but not in a hotel of this standard ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have i had to pay in advance the building we were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel after explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in hyde park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal when we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card this meant that i was now   down for a   bill next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past all through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception i can safely say i do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main no positive the rooms were a bit small it is a beautiful place and in an excellent location if you like to walk you can easily get to many of london s main attractions the tube is also conveniently close and easy to use no negative fantastic property great location the rooms are clean and comfortable the staff is extremely helpful especially julian who was nice enough to upgrade my room i would definitely recommend this property to any business or leisure travellers only issue we has was on check in we didn t have the credit card that we used to make the booking as the card had been cancelled make sure you take the credit card that you use to make the booking this was sorted but frustrating bed in our room had broken springs but this was quickly resolved and we were given a new room straight away nice hotel with a lot of character and history nice staff especially razvann who sorted our issue with the credit card with lots of patience and a friendly manner breakfast was nice and plentiful great location just a walk to lots of restarants  min walk to bus stops and train stations staff were helpful and provided good information for tourists we booked a superior double room which on the whole was fine however if we had been staying for more than   days it would have been very difficult to store suitcases ect as room was a tad on the small sideno positive trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort the finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves i often stay here when visiting london the location is great and breakfast is very good staff are excellent when i arrived after   days of travelling i was told that my room would only be ready in   hours and that i should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale the rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had in london the breakfast was about average but over priced manager was helpful porters were friendly very noisy area and noisy hotel very small double rooms staff unable to help or call back regarding complaints no door man and no help with luggage upon arrival the room wasn t cleaned as well as expected good transport links the bedroom was of reasonable size and bed comfortable but the shower was minuscule and the toilet difficult to access a larger person might have found it impossible to use there are steps at the front of the building and to some of the public areas handrails absent comfortable bed and the hotel worked with me to ensure i had a shower and ease of access to my room staff were helpful room service prompt and food adequate but not exciting the only thing i could think of was that its a bit pricy for what it was we booked this hotel because it was on offer through booking com at   off usual price otherwise we wouldnt have been able to afford it we booked a superior double room for my mum and i wouldnt have described it as superior but it was a beautiful room bed was comfy bathroom was spotless and old building itself was just stunning breakfast was superb and well worth   prebooked a selection of hot food including boiled eggs pastries and toast fresh fruit yoghurt salmon cheese and ham location is just around the corner from queensway situated on the central line tube station which had a lift great for luggage the room was so small and dark it was unpleasant the shower was soooo small you couldn t move and i am not fat the worst hotel room we ve ever stayed no positive there is nothing i don t like about this hotel i love this hotel we have stayed   times now and have enjoyed every stay the staff are welcoming and friendly and it is good value for money very central i have stayed in many london hotels in the past and this is my favourite poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts i would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise the neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until     we could hear everything clearly from the  th floor with the window closed narrow corridors difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom expensive breakfast so many good cafes in     min walking distance good water pressure and temperature less than   mins walk to queensway bayswater tube mattress uncomfortable like it was old i could hear the tube till late view from window was a concrete courtyard room very small and no parking even though booking com said there was shower drenched the bathroom complimentary wine chocolates and bathroom products room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the  th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the  th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room location was good staff very professional lobby was lovely unfortunately i saw the mattress when the cleaners were changing the room and there was a large blood stain on it put me off a little great location close to the underground staff were very helpful and lovely to deal with a little faster check in staff were very helpful and efficient the location is excellent with both underground and buses just around the corner the room was ample and comfortable we enjoyed our three days here i had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but i took a chance i had requested and early check in and we arrived very early  am upon arrival i was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me i quickly went into defense mode and told them that i had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it she called and told them i had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready they kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said i was high priority to get in our room we returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited while waiting i heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests i kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in we did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room club room was what it was called it was in the basement but clean and nice we had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit tea and hot chocolate upon checkout two of us left early and one remained i stopped at desk and said that one person remained and i wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything assured we were paid up when last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning she replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast we weren t charged the hotel made things right by my reservation but i am not sure i would stay again most of the staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was close to tube station and the area was safe no negative we were allowed to check in an hour early with no fuss we just used the hotel as a base for somewhere to read charge on the evening the stay was pleasant and would not think twice about returning the bathroom was like a coffin and not a clean one at that the entrance of the hotel was lovely but the rest was awful you could have been in a travel lodge and saved some pennies very noisy at the front of the hotel the bed was comfy and it was right next to hyde park and queensway tube as the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they still called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning every monday morning or so they said the hotel has a fire drill advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception staff and location the lobby looks great the hotel has elevator and air conditioning room was modern but very small for   people   lrg suitcase only   would fit lying down there was no lift very narrow staircase no porter also no fridge good location close to train station easy walk to oxford street bathroom was great very modern room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break great location we stayed here for the notting hill carnival which was walking distance very close to the tube staff were all very helpful let us leave our bags in the luggage room come back to get things out of them later staff couldn t do enough nice clean bathroom some of the staff is not fluent in english but they do try to be professional for the money i thought the room could ve been a little bit bigger there was barely enough space to walk around the bed the bathroom was great the breakfast buffet was good but i got food poisoning from the room service food late one night the bedroom walls were all dirty and the trim needed a paint job needs new wallpaper quite badly and the woodwork throughout the whole body of the place is long overdue for a full restoration i read that it was last done in   so it has a bit of a tired feel the location was ok except for trying to get out to a good club but to be fair there was one in the area that just happened to be closed for an event it s colourful there and it was nice to enjoy the park the bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous lol the bed was clean very comfortable and a big king size the bathroom was clean perfect i ve stayed many times in different hotels in london some are bloody noisy in the morning with rubbish trucks or noisy kitchens below this hotel was ok great location for the city busses and the tube remember if you are over   bring your bus pass from home i m from liverpool we could use ours for free bus trips after    am service on arrival felt that the staff member on reception was rude we arrived after  pm and the room wasn t ready so we has to wait location was great long narrow maze of hallways and repeating corners to access rooms beautifully crafted historic structure elegant sitting room and bar carved stairway leaded glass windows with window seats cocktail bar and high tea available a fresh bowl of apples at reception every day and bathtubs booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at   pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate public rooms were very impressive and comfortable the location was great kensington gardens across the road and two underground stations within minutes staff helpful in arranging theatre tickets clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip i m not happy about place were i stayed in but location is really good good but not value for money i did not like being at the front of the hotel we stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street the service was excellent and staff very professional and very accommodating when we had to move hotels because of a burst boiler the fruit bowl was limited there was only an orange banana and an apple loved the comfy bed had a great night sleep the staff were very friendly no negative the location was excellent staff very friendly the bed was very nice the bathroom was extremely tiny and room considering that we were given an upgrade was very small nothing last minute deal that made staying here affordable for an overnight trip and the hotel lived up to its marketing as an executive environment very plush with great staff a tiny noisy room very deceptively photographed the breakfast booked the preceding night but forgotten was good when it finally arrived comfy bed size of the rooms is small and i don t think management can now do anything about it location of the hotel and the attitude response of the staff simply marvelous i didn t like the fact that the sink and bath wouldn t drain properly and would fill up and you would have to wait half an hour for the sink to drain friendly staff very helpful rooms were very nice and tidy the room was a bit small the bathtub did not have a door or shower curtain so the whole bathroom got all wet from a shower also no fan in the bathroom the wifi was fine but not the greatest the usb port the room came with did not even work the hotel was very close to hyde park and a lot of restaurants with   tube stations one street over excellent location the staff was nice big room big bathroom the room not same on booking very small bathroom very small supreiuer room not comfort and very small and not occupied couple internet good we were given the broken boiler story too and they tried to move us to another hotel until i asked for the price difference to be refunded we paid   and the sister hotel was advertised at   we were suddenly found an available room at the current hotel also the room smelt of drains sewage breakfast was great as was the history of the hotel tiny bathroom to be honest not suitable for the price of offer also very odd window blinds in our room meant there was never any daylight which i didn t like great location quiet yet very central good staff on reception clean and comfortable rooms and a nice character hotel with the lily langtry history the presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration the hotel was conveniently located close to a main tube and good car park so we were able to avoid the congestion charge and not have too far to walk for the hotel i was sorry to leave but god willing i ll be able to swing by the grand royale before i leave i like cozy places so i was right at home the staff was helpfull and very kind it was my birthday when i arrived and they brought me a complimentary box of chocolates and a bottle of merlot it took them almost half a hour to check me in and in that time   people complained who were not in front of me but were still served first i was ignored until i complainedno positive the room was very small there was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window for the price we paid i would have expected breakfast to be included the staff were attentive friendly and helpful it was in a good location ideal for the tube the facilities in the room were good checking out excellent location   mins from st pancras lovely clean and comfortable rooms a great choice for breakfast hot or cold staff lovely kind and helpful a brilliant last minute find and we will be coming back here again and again special thanks to ankur for looking after us the bathroom was too small i m small and struggled but my     partner found it far too cramped the staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that the bed and pillows were very comfortable great location the shower screen in our room was not big enough had to point the shower head at the bathroom wall and be careful moving so that water did not splash off me still ended up with a pool of water on the floor and the toilet had a bath the next day to avoid the hassle the history of the building and original features in the public rooms were fantastic we ll typical of london hotels small rooms though it s a   star bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet there s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management they offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then location wise very accessible to public transport near hyde park kensington park the staff were all accommodating the hotel itself tells a lot of history breakfast buffet is excellent when we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels   minutes away the boiler had broken in the hotel they did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem they also had us sign a paper committing us to full   night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move we were then transported at   p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full   night stay without inspection of the room or area at that hour we had no choice but to make the payment we were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a   minute rail ride away we asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request we called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels we then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location around   p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel although i was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the  nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an   year old child the room was tiny much much smaller than most small european rooms worse yet it was filthy dirty the carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled the courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside we have pictures to support this description it was shocking that we were not released from the reservation we have used booking com in the past but never again they should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment the location and buffet breakfast were ok the staff seemed to care that we were incredibly disappointed about how we were treated and the poor condition of the tiny room we were required to stay in but they did nothing to release us from the reservation no negative beautiful hotel great staff the manager himself made sure all my requests were in place the staff was so helpful and mannered the location is great close to everything no comment wow the main lobby and reception area looks gergian victorian and edwardian style good location for everything very close to the bayswater queens underground train station and walking distance to paddington train station lots of restaurants to choose very near also close to hyde park that you can relate with the nature and get some fresh air the place is quiete and peaceful and very relax at room   the staffs are friendly and helpful the buffet breakfast was excellent i had a healthy breakfast option this four star hotel is highly recommended well done keep it up the excellent service folks rooms are little small beautiful lobby kind personal comfortable bed breakfast is good served at glamourous interior location is very close to hyde park with a lot of small restaurants around we arrived after a long journey only to be told they were going to transfer us to one of their sister hotels in paddington when we objected they miraculously found a room for us the foyer is beautiful early   s with wooden panelling and stained glass windows this was why i selected this hotel as it has character we were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view shower was a bit small but fine to use free coffee on arrival was a very nice touch lovely wood panelled public rooms giving a nice comfortable old fashioned club atmosphere our room was cosy but contemporary and very comfortable being lower ground floor this was expected and reflected in the price not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to london so there was no going back this wasn t the hotels fault no positive rooms were very small and they only service the room for your arrival then after your departure though in saying this i actually asked them to service it while we were out and they did only other negative wos that they gave us keys to a room already occupied so we walked in on another couple beautiful old world style building and very curtious staff accces to the main attractions of london wos very easy and pleanty of bars and caff just around the corner the bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day the welcome the nice gestures the friendly helpful staff the wonderful breakfast the location the beautiful building the room was very adequate for my granddaughter and me the bathroom is small but very modern room was like a box literally no windows couldn t swing a kitten very claustrophobic would not consider staying here again dining room and reception areas the area isn t as nice as the hotel but beyond the hotels control lovley place great helpful staff went out of their way to make us comfortable the room was superb i wouldnt think twice on booking again bathroom was very tiny not even a proper sink no breakfast included location is good just outside hyde park walking distance   min from the city centre very accomodating staff members they overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink i saw this because i dropped a soap the shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean i would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel i ve ever stayed at beds were soft breakfast selection and variety was good not all single rooms have a bathtub showers in some singles are very small by us standards normal for uk though walking distance to many good restaurants hyde park   minute walk to underground rooms were very very clean both times i stayed felt pretty safe walking alone at night in this area felt that premises room were secure and it s pretty the bathroom was clean the   shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning room was a shoe box so small couldn t use the dressing table as was up against the bed and was a struggle to open dresser drawer to get hairdryer carpet wasn t the cleanest one key for room with   guests bar closed at  pm main sitting area closed off for magic show you had to pay to go to room was very small also we would have loved to have dined in the restaurant but it is only open fur breakfast this is a real shame as i m sure it would be a lovely place to eat this is a beautiful hotel with some amazing features and a superb bar rooms far too small booked a superior room but nothing superior about it bed was hard pillows were hard no sheets only a duvet that had seen better days shower leaked all over the bathroom due to inadequate screen staff friendly breakfast was nice but felt should have been included for the room price also weren t told by reception if you pre booked the day before it was   instead of   i couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road the entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out after a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall absolutely disgusted at our treatment no positive we were moved hotels due to an electrical fault i understand this was out of the hotels control but the alternative accommodation was not in such a good location i d been looking forward to a drink in the grand looking reception area and a short walk to hyde park the alternative accommodation was sorted fast the room was not very clean and was extremely hot couldn t open a window we were upgraded but it was a tiny room with a small bed there were cracks in the tiles it was in desperate need of a refurbishment they provided what i had requested which was a nice gesture a very small room but it was clean very friendly and helpful receptionists specially one guy who worked in the evening i forgot his name he knows how to take care of the customers on arrival i was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available although i asked for another room i was told there wasn t one that i would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard when i got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one i d paid for and was  aud cheaper per night i asked to be transferred back to the hotel i d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic this all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time fridge would be handy i like the beautiful old world feel of this hotel respect for the character of the building the service at breakfast was excellent the staff were generally friendly and professional my room was lovely and very comfortable the location is very good room very tight to work around the bed and bathroom tight was expecting an iron in the room location was good and close to central landmarks staff at reception pleasant and helpful facilities good in the room difficult to move around the room as the area around the bed was a bit tight the building is beautiful old style with lots of carved wood and leaded glass natural light in the bathroom which was modern and super clean no dinner available in the restaurant but there are loads of places for dinner and breakfast also if you want just a minute s walk away the hotel is on a really quiet street with a busy one around the corner not just one but two tube stations a minute or two away the new hotel was in an area where we did not want to be the hotel was fine apart from its location we were transferred to another hotel by free taxi given free drinks in the bar whilst we waited for taxi no tv remote in room single room so tiny maybe i am naive but i still think   is a lot for a single basement room with no breakfast bathroom was the nicest i have seen in a while good breakfast too many tables crammed in though nice quiet area round the corner from two underground stations and two lines jubilee and central would definitely book again very small room eapecially as it was a club deluxe very small bathroom could hardly move and staff customer service was not particularly friendly the reception area looked tired tidy clean room comfortable bed good air conditioning and nice bedding nice touch of complimentary chocolates fruit and wine the room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives i would still stay again the hotel is a grand old building and this quirkyness has been retained the staff were very helpful the rooms clean and beds comfortable fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about  incs around either side so my husband just managed it the receptionist suggested we mention this in future excellent location with   tubes handy lovely breakfast very helpful staff who for us went the extra mile where our son was concerned as he had ridden the london race and his bike got taken care of and fruit provided very willingly to be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish we arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty my husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving we had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow i am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary the building is very beautiful room and en suite were very small for two adults i lay on the bed with the suitcase to give floor space to my wife standing in a bath on a non slip mat to shower is not acceptable nowadays booking com not the hotel website lists parking beware this hotel does not have parking however i was directed by reception to a nearby underground carpark comfy bed great choice and quality at the buffet breakfast ac and shower work well en suite bathroom is cramped reception staff were friendly and courteous great location room was smaller than appeared in pictures and there were steps inside the room entry way which are a tripping hazard interior of hotel is beautiful but worn in places two best things about this hotel is that it is extremely near   underground stations and that it was immediately across from hyde park room was very small and cramped although en suite was adequate housekeeping staff slam doors constantly during the afternoon air conditioning in the room was fantastic comfy bed and good pillows breakfast was splendid the single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot you would not want to linger too long in that confined space i loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where i met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase it was good value for money and its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring kensington gardens and palace and the royal albert hall the staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast there was a slightly bad smell in the second room we didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room staff was friendly when my sister in law and i found our twin room too tiny to move around in they accommodated us and gave us a bigger room after the first night our favorite part was the hot chocolate in the room and this electric tea pot that boiled water amazingly fast loved the free wifi too the hotel s location was close to subway stations too which was very nice incredibly small room so much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another can t swing a cat or pack a suitcase lovely decor downstairs the theatre bar was quaint to the lock on room door was broken window latch broken exceptionally polite friendly helpful staff beautiful historic building with many original features very good breakfast comfortable bed and pillows ideal location for events in hyde parkno negative really comfortable bed and a very quite room this hotel is perfect if you are wanting a good nights sleep i would definitely visit again staff very friendly and polite very very small rooms a bit like sleeping in a cupboard it was all very comfy but very cramped when you first arrive the main reception and entrance hall is gorgeous the staff all very nice and friendly asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at   pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day near queens way tube needs a smartening up of its appearance but then it s in bayswater not mayfair the photos in booking com give the impression of a delightful old hotel it isn t it s a bit down at heel in need of refurbishment the dark wood panelling in the reception area is a little gloomy and depressing not a bright start the room was tiny although clean and comfortable small but immaculately clean bathroom with a low pressure shower you don t really get a lot for your money here pillow and bed too hard and room too confined especially bathroom however upon request they gave me a soft pillow nice if sports had been shown on tv but available at nearby pubs hotel and room very clean and well maintained staff very helpful and pleasant staff very service oriented very convenient location small room with a small bed but slept well with extra comforter the grand royale is very handy to transportation it was nicely updated and had lovely period decor in the common areas air conditioned slightly small bedroom but i guess that is london the location next to underground and hyde park was ideal for us the staff were very helpful and polite we had just got engaged and so they kindly had a card fruit wine and chocolates in our bedroom as a gift been many places and could not fault it wonderful air conditioning in room beautiful historical hotel rooms average size but had all facilities the reception staff were amazing some of the best customer service have received as an extensive traveller conceige also extremely helpful at all times lovely bar and loung area location cannot be beaten for being close to hyde park and shopping excellent overall experience and value for money price is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for which is a fantastic hotel breakfast was great but a tad expensive staff were very friendly and helpful despite how busy the hotel was at that time the room was amazing extremely comfortable and modern the hotel is in a great location as it is very close to buses on bayswater road close to bayswater and queensway underground and easy to walk across hyde park despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small there was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze bed very comfy room was clean and location was good rooms a bit cramped no fridge marked walls furniture in the room interfering works yard below the window grandeur of the entrance lounge bar our room was tiny i found some difficulties moving around inside the room but i guess it was the value for money condition located by hyde park very touristy area around   minutes walk from   major museums and at least   major attractions like palaces and stuff tube station   minutes walk lots of shops beautiful interiors of lobby and restaurant areas carved wooden stairs big luxurious chimneys leather seats and sofas in common lobby rooms there was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much we did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there the rooms were clean breakfast was a great variety and staff were very friendly i tried to ask the reception staff for restaurant recommendations in london which they seemed to know little about beautiful interiors even better than the photos provided the rooms are clean and comfortable with all amenities requested provided they stuck us in the basement for     for   nights they could not give us at least first floor the wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week i could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day the desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything i had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi they advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising cost     pounds to get to the airport all they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby the women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the usa forgetaboutit bed was comfy room was very clean nice it was close to two tube stations no negative interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades the lovely unaltered appearance of victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period we had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient good position with tube station very close queensway hyde park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for landmarks ie kensington palace serpentine diana memorial water feature nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for good choice in london i was extremely annoyed that the bill did not add up yo the number of days times the rate displayed by booking com the rate changes as the week progresses warning the staff were wonderful and like all hotels sometimes too busy but service was excellent the room was supposed to be a superior double room it wasn t at all the window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned you could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed for this price not including breakfast the hotel was very unsatisfactory a terrible cheek i would definitely want some money back i would never go to this hotel again they are cheats the breafast was very good and the personal there were also very good they cater for people eating gluten free so that was good i wrote and asked them about this per e mail but got no reply sunday morning breakfast manic busy staff were great but other guests who could see people waiting just sat and enjoyed their  rd helping of food guys it s not an all you can eat other rude quests who think they are too important to queue at check out desk nice little extras wine chocolates and fruit friendly staff mostly there were steps in our room right after you enter it do request for another room if this is of inconvenience to you otherwise this is a great hotel to stay the room was of decent size the bed was very comfortable and the staff accommodated to our requests standard rooms are so small that two people need to carefully choreograph their moves to get dressed or go to the restroom excellent location staff was very helpful for example we booked a tour through the hotel there was a miscommunication between the vendor and the hotel on where we would be picked up for the tour we had to take a taxi to catch up with the tour and the hotel compensated us for the taxi fare breakfast at the hotel was excellent tge roome size is very small the bathroom high is short for me at least i loved the location and how frindly are the stuff rooms is small but very comfortable room was very small we were placed on the lower ground floor no views could have told us a poor way to end a   week european vacation picturing on the web very deceiving no positive ordered and paid for a large wine and was given a small one bar busy could have been an error and didn t was to cause a scene hotel very handy for underground bed comfortable a nice gesture it was my husbands  th birthday and management give him a bottle of red wine the room was small but so comfortable and nice beautiful place the hotel is absolutely beautiful i loved the area in london westminster the staff were so helpful and friendly i didn t like that i got a flower delivery that was never delivered to my room and that when my friend called to inquire no staff member thought to check delivery room flowers were found after i went home money lost for my friend who sent them i loved location and decor of lobby and downstairs rooms i stayed   nights all was fine left to go to peaks region when returned was notified my   night reservation was cancelled was told by staff my credit card was rejected it was same card that was used   nights for earlier stay had a hassle getting rebooked at different hotel found out later from another guest that hotel had water leak and needed to move customers to different hotel did not appreciate being told my credit card was the problem when clearly it was not no positive the room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick i am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest staff the fact they took the money from my bank account several days prior to our arrival especially when it was said we can pay at the hotel upon arrival and then having to wait days for any refunds to be put back into our bank account easy access to hyde park and the tube stations for the price of   for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when i complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast also the photos of a superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed there is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed we won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money i will go with the budget option next time no positive sent to park grand paddington hotel room was very small no cupboard space no fridge no iron bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed no mini bar very very disappointed not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the grand royale hype park compared to the hotel we were sent too for   nights really were looking forward to staying at this hotel told boiler had broken and sent to another hotel park grand paddington hote no character or history be careful when booking the total i paid by far exceeded the sum of the days times booking com s price it went up and up each day quite unfair to a trusting soul who did not add up my own bill before clicking warning to others all the staff were very lovely and helpful and polite this place is a historic gem no negative the staff and in particular louanne were utterly accommodating in every way we were there to celebrate both a special birthday and anniversary and we were treated like royalty the little extras included a bottle of wine and basket of fruit and free upgrade lovely touches which were greatly appreciated room very small and we had to wait almost an hour for sandwiches when we ordered room service the manager did say sorry for this in the morning to be fair but no good to us as we were very hungry the night before we also went to the bar for a night cap and they had no bailys cream so we went to our room very disappointed location chaos at check in room not ready got back bag had not been taken to room no to remote room so small even i was off edge of bed im only just over  ft couldn t move air conditioning didn t work this was meant to be a delux double location bar closed to residents at    pm no snacks available     min wait for reception to service a drink snack request after    pm rooms very small location friendly staff the bar closed at   and the barman did not ask anyone if they would like more drinks the bar was full he proceeded to close the shutter and walk out would of liked notice more revenue for the hotel as most of the residents would of purchased another drink reception staff excellent my partner and i were celebrating an anniversary and the reception put a fruit basket wine in the room and rose petals on the bed excellent service throughout our stay invited to wait for our room to be ready by having a drink in the bar waited   minutes for bar staff but no one arrived to serve us location is good comfortable beds good shower pressure the so called superior double room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated club room and not a superior room also we checked in at     hr and returned at     hr to be told that there was a minimum of a   hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available we also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered nothing to shout out about room was tiny no where near what i would expect from a superior room been in london premier inn s that were literally twice the size character and style of the hotel was really nice paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around the price of the room was too much for what we had no positive the room was snug not too room to walk around the bed and the scrambled eggs didn t really resemble scrambled eggs the room was clean and tidy the staff were friendly and helpful excellent location for our stay and really impressive interior price view from bedroom over a noisy and untidy back yard very expensive for a tiny room you get a bigger room in a travelodge for a quarter of the price over rated and over priced the staff never smiled and only ever said   words to me the whole time i was there i also got a poor view of their ventilation system for the money i paid i did not deserve a view of their ventilation it was a very pretty place and just right around the corner from a beautiful park and easy to hop on the underground to get to places the room is way too small including the bathroom lighting was also poor lovely soft bed and the buffet breakfast in the restaurant the theatre bar also looked great but was not open when we where there we did have a small issue with the staff being unable to locate our luggage which was left with them on the day we were leaving this was resolved but still did worry me at the time friendly staff and clean hotel very characterful a little tired needs an up grade but must retain character our superior room had little floor space no chairs to sit on no space by the bed you had to get on the bed from the front surely you can t call this superior but still liked the overhaul character beautiful building and great location the room is small and there s no elevator to the  th floor very good location comfort bed nice and kind staff quiet and well designed just a few walk to kensington gardens and kensington palace they left us outside of the room one day before check out because we have been told that we hadn t paid at the check in when they forgot to ask us for the entire payment and asked for the first night after many discussions with the hotel manager we have been allowed access to the room they said they tryed to reach us via phone many times and this is absolutelly false location very close to two tube stationno negative the room was small but spotless the beds were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned and restocked with towels tea and biscuits daily fresh flowers and fruit on arrival were a lovely touch the continental breakfast was outstanding lots of variety and the food was delicious the room had all you would expect but v small and no natural light expensive for what it was had i had a better room i would have been v happy with hotel v good location close to everything room quiet and bed comfortable the walk in hyde park excellent the room   was very small for a double the bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed there was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use the bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it this should not be classed as a   star hotel in my opinion the reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests the reception area was quite attractive i think we were downgraded to the basement even though booking was for a deluxe double the receptionist mumbled something about it when we checked in the room and en suite were tiny but clean the reception area was stunning lily langtry vibe was lovely room was far too small even for london standards you could not leave the case stand up as there was no where physically to put it a few feet more in the rooms would be less greedy this was a superior room good location staff were very friendly and helpful god breakfast quality had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable staff very friendly and attentive bathroom lovely tea and coffee facilities topped up every day and fruit provided good location just round the corner from the tube bed was uncomfy room was very small even though i booked a deluxe certain areas in need of decoration no extractor fan in bathroom and it floods when in shower due to small screen hotel was very clean and it was an ideal location for hyde park also it is closer to kensington gardens staff seamed very busy which caused them to forget about letting us know when our room was available so check in wasn t the time we expected which was very disappointing excellent location clean rooms room was a little on the small size but adequate beautiful old historic building with a lot of original features the staff were very friendly and helpful good quality breakfast with lots of choice excellent location for kensington palace hyde park some minor maintenance issues no teabags on hospitality tray and curtain not hanging correctly so letting light in from early morning some public areas in need of tlc bar prices steep   for a diet cole and a soda water clean and quiet very close to queensway underground and hyde park bedroom and bathroom small as expected in london but more modern than anticipated the room was very small despite being upgraded we did move to a similar grade room with a different layout but still short on space but never mind we were there to attend a concert and sightseeing london is amazing the black cab drivers were so friendly and chatty made us laugh the decor was very impressive throughout staff were helpful and friendly all was clean on the day we were to check in i missed a call at  am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in paddington for our entire stay having googled this boiler issue i found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler upon arrival at the hotel i was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel i asked if there was a member of management i could speak to about this matter i expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that i had chosen to stay i also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that i had found i was told that this was just something that happened to the   hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time after causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest however i was happy that my original booking had then been honoured location was great with easy transport links cockroach running across the carpet uncomfortable mattress rubbish outside the window being put in the basement shower so small you couldn t bend down to pick up the soapno positive the weather but hey its england in summer the staff were very helpful welcoming the room was clean and well equipped the location is perfect and the hotel itself is very comfortable and stylish the bath shower water rained out onto the floor there was no shower curtain glass barrier to keep the water in the tub caused more than the usual anxiety during use of the bathroom location booked   rooms double deluxe  st room had obviously had smokers in next room damp then settled for last room very small not sure where deluxe was also booked   other deluxe double rooms which were allocated to our colleagues when we arrived as they informed us of room numbers when colleagues arrived their rooms apparently had no hot water then rooms were locked and then had been given to other people they ended up in tiny single rooms not what we paid for they made us late for a very important appointment it seemed like this group of hotels were shipping people in and out of sister hotels not at all happy no positive nothing absolutely everything top quality hotel clean stunning architecture friendly courteous polite accommodating staff excellent service rooms breakfast with plenty of choice dining staff friendly and helpful few minutes to underground trains ace hotel anyone persevering where to go wont be disappointed at this hotel the room size and the bed are quiet small but that s how it is in most london i feel terrible for big sized people fitting in is a hassle the location and the ease of service tried to move us to a sister hotel that was in a terrible location so we made them shuttle us back wasting about an hour rooms tiny staff rude nice foyer good breakfast that is possibly the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel and i have stayed in a few and we were upgraded to a larger room i really didn t think you could cram a shower bath and toilet and basin into  m  but they managed it it was nice and clean but it was absolutely tiny and given the cost isn t cheap it is a big let down from the main part of the hotel the hotel is very impressive beautiful timber work large inviting reception area and dining room bar is quirky beautiful to look at inside buyer beware bait and switch they tried to switch my reservation to another hotel charge me the same rate but the hotel they tried to move me to was a lesser hotel that would normally charge half the price i saw them doing this to other travelers too no positive the rooms and bathrooms are tiny house keeping didn t change the sheets once in the   nights i was there great location with excellent internet service different little biscuits provided every day nice touch rooms are very small location is very good   underground stations within a few minutes walk and close to paddington rail station breakfast is excellent very friendly staff stately lobby also next to hyde park for the daily run no negative everything the hotel and room and staff were excellent i cannot complain about anything about the hotel or the stay and will definitely be staying here again in the near future it was fine fr me but the superior room was on the small side and i can imagine for larger folks this would be a bit oppressive amazingly friendly staff from checkin until check out quiet room requested and received delicious fresh breakfast in wonderful old ambient building the room was too small the walls were marked to the point it s the first thing you notice about the room unfortunately the room was a     at the very very most i left after a few hours the pictures advertised on the website were nice staff were friendly hmm the room appeared to be a bit smaller than we thought the interesting thing was that we had to climb a few steps after opening the door to a our room which is just enough to fit in a small writing desk a double bed and a bathroom the splash glass of the bathtub is too small we had to be carefully not to wet the floor interesting experience afterall p our special requests were taken care of nice frontdesk staff stunning decorations there are two underground stations nearby and bus stations as well paddington station is just  mins away on foot for taking a train to the windsor castle  mins by underground to victoria station   mins walking to a street full of souvenir shops restaurants supermarkets metro stations post office telecommunications shops for sim card great location staff in breakfast area abrupt and no customer interaction or smiles queue for breakfast took over   mins to be seated facilities are very small proximity to paddington and reception staff tina very friendly moved to another sister hotel due to water leakage problem but driver dropped me at the wrong place room too small reserved for double bed but they gave me one small single bed clean rooms and bathrooms were a bit small but everything was provided for so no worries the staff were wonderful and so helpful great service and great people breakfasts were very nice the hotel is lovely and very comfortable no porter at front door hard for some drag big bag up extensive breakfast buffet with pots of coffee very interesting story about history of hotel quiet and priced well hop on hop off stop closeby our room was rather small we also had to go down a flight of stairs as soon as you open the door the door open in word and there was not enough room on the landing for person in the door the location was delightful the history of the building was also a wonderful and great surprise the breakfast buffet was one of my favorites the room a superior deluxe was the smallest room i ve ever stayed in very little space two adults could not stand either side or at the end of the bed together more of a single than a double let alone a superior deluxe location and breakfast excellent i was very annoyed with the check in they wanted to move me to another partner hotel in paddington due to problem with heating they rang earlier in the day suggesting this i completely refused and was eventually given a room in this hotel but i dislike the way this was done and it was almost a favour to give me the room i had booked no positive tiny rooms repeated requests to hotel staff to provide extra coat hangers which eventually arrived a couple of hours later rip off prices in the bar   for a single gin and tonic no window able to be opened for fresh air air con noisy this room was the biggest room i d refuse to stay in the smaller rooms paid   per night but could ve got it for   if i d booked a couple off days before nice property decent location it wasn t really a problem for   night but the bathroom was really small very clean and well maintained though very friendly attentive and professional staff very comfortable and clean room fabulous building on the whole lovely breakfast normally i am critical of london hotels but this one has no problems at all extremely comfortable superb service great shower very clean and modern nice cosy bar and opposite hyde park according to the escape map behind the door i believe my room should be the smallest in this hotel there are even no place for me to open the luggage location staff perfect description of rooms superior deluxe and club none of them were applicable to the rooms we were shown the club room should be graded standard staff helpful and polite the room was tiny i am pretty sure they did not measure it accurately always getting in each others way the bathroom was also a nook and not much hanging room good location convenient for   trains and buses being adjacent to hyde park was also a benefit lovely period style entrance and ground floor the room is fairly small compared to other hotels i stayed in london before the hairdryer is really old the rear side is widely open no mesh filter which is almost a given in any recent design i got a chunk of my hair sucked in had to ask for a scissors to cut my hair i love the neighbour been to london many times always stayed around hyde park area it s also pretty convenient to get around from the hotel it s a very old building has it s charm certainly staffs were friendly and helpful internet works great and the bed is very comfortable very small cosy bedroom bathroom beautiful building friendly reception staff and barman we didn t have breakfast so cant comment on restaurant the location is super near tube stations everything did not enjoy my   nights stay and wouldn t recommend to anyone i was on business so my company was paying if i had to use my own money i woukd give it a rating of minus   not a happy customerno positive did not have any evening service in restaurant also the menue for room service was very limited the barman victor always made you feel welcome in the lounge bar i don t think guests should be offered a discount just to pre book breakfast anyone paying to stay should be offered breakfast at the same price location and access to tube small rooms i mean very smell we couldn t even walk around the bed and that s all the space we had impossible to get undressed or move about bathroom was even worse we did get a refund on our breakfast due to complaining about our room great staff great breakfast there was no changing room or area in the toilets for guests who had already booked out and had baggage stored for the day the decor wood panels and bar area were superb the bedroom was a little on the small size but it modern and comfy very good breakfast don t be disillusioned by the pretty pictures staff was rather rude to us and lacked complete understanding of english language none of the staff appeared to be native speakers room was extremely small and we had to use a stairs to get from bathroom to sleeping area which also makes the space advertised as larger than it really is even being a very slim person myself i couldn t reach the other side of the bed without moving the furniture window could not be opened as it was half covered by the balcony wall and floor the air conditioning was very dusty the location was good with an easy underground connection to major landmarks also the lobby was impressive bathroom facilities were okay but very small the superior room which we were supposed to have was a little small and the   or   steps down to the bathroom were a little inconvenient but not so bad as to spoil our stay this hotel was a surprise from the moment we walked through the door the staff were very friendly and helpful and the theatre bar has to be seen to be believed breakfast was fine and the location near queensway station was excellent for all areas of central london we shall consider this hotel again when looking to stay in london the mattress was ok but not as comfortable as it could be i cannot recommend this hotel for those with ambulatory issues because there is no access other than stairs at the entrance there were also stairs to enter my room but i understand there are other rooms without otherwise a hidden gem staff service was excellent very helpful with restaurant recommendations directions and use of umbrella location was great around the corner from the central line tube stop very quiet the price we paid for our stay we were disappointed with the room we thought it was on the small side and the bathroom was compact also for the price i think breakfast should have been included the bed was comfortable there was a free safe very clean room not far from the tube station local shops and restaurants i cannot fault this hotel at all everything was amazing from the welcoming attitude of the staff to the breakfast in bed and the room my best stay in london so far and i m regularly travelling to london for leisure with friends family a fantastic first experience in london for my partner too especially being in the suite with the   poster bed even asked for some rose petals and a bottle of prosecco to be in the room on arrival soppy i know and everything was a fantastic surprise for my partner fantastic location right next to the tube station in central london great restaurants and small shops cash point in the neighbouring street and all for an amazing price   recommend and would definitely stay again the room was on the lower level and was very small and the bathroom was tiny the shower stall was   x   my     husband could barely stand up in it and it would have been impossible for him to raise his arms to wash his hair so ridiculous not worth over   a night the hotel lobby and sitting areas are very impressive but the room was a major disappointment room was tiny and had to enter up staircase immediately inside room door and shower sprayed all over bathroom due to tiny shower screen very ornate interior but not as grand as it looks online the room was very small and the green security light over the door was much too bright i could not sleep because of this the bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet the staff were helpful and courteous the hotel was located in a quiet street and close to the tube station no negative very friendly staff nice room but very small bathroom stayed in for one night only but would recommended to anyone very good location very close to underground station quensway and kensigton gardens certain reception staff less than helpfull cleaning supervisor agressive manager advised who gave his attention breakfast was excellent and the selection was good there was no phone signal in my room which made me stressed of not being able to receive important phone calls perfect location a clean room and bathroom super fast wifi and friendly helpful staff the bathroom was really small hate small bathrooms but then we only really slept in the room so weren t there really as we were out all day loved my bed very comfortable just didn t like it being in the basement breakfast was really brilliant everything you could want to eat either hot or continental i expected to get body lotion and had to purchase some at a nearby store only shower gel and shampoo was provided location setting and decor as well as a clean and comfortable room view when requested coffee and tea making facilites in the room no negative friendly staff comfortable room sparkling clean bathroom stayed for one night on business and feel this is great value for money not the lap of luxury but had everything you need the room we stayed in was in need of a bit of a refurb the wallpaper looked tatty and blinds were broken this was a little disappointing and i did contemplate asking to be moved however we were on a tight schedule for the day so didn t want to get upset over it rooms are very small the staff were all so helpful and very nice they all made us feel extremely welcome and were very attentive they also put a card with some chocolates and fruit in our room as it was my partners birthday something i had only mentioned over email beforehand when trying to find a restaurant for the evening of our stay this was a lovely touch the hotel its self is beautiful and in a great location right next to hyde park a short   minute walk to queensway tube station and a   or   minute walk to bayswater tube station so very easily accessible it also only takes around     minutes to get to the hotel from euston bonus the value for money is great the lavatory is incredibly small i was living in the room   which is a so called club room if you are a big guy and right handed you will absolutely find it difficult cleaning yourself after using the toiletno positiveno negative cyn ann on reception was such a star helped me sort tickets for gig i d forgotten to print at home all staff very friendly great stay thank youno negative we were having a weekend in london for our anniversary the staff delivered lots of gifts to our room chocolates wine a fruit basket lots of luxury items which really made our weekend nothing was to much trouble and everyone was very attentive and welcoming from start to finish manger offered us an upgrade or a better deal on are nexy visit at the end of stay we will denfinley be returning thank you all everything was fantastic on arrival had to wait to check in and was then asked to move to another hotel i firmly refused and was promptly allocated a room i asked staff to confirm my booking of a superior double would be honoured i was told it would be room so small i had to climb over bed to get into it it was however comfortable and i will no doubt use the hotel again even though i am still not sure if the room i got was a superior double how small must a standard double be location i found the room a bit cold and the thermostat did not seem to be controlled from the room nice and quiet and yet close to the trains and heyd park very clean the only negative is that the restaurant is not open in the evening but there are plenty of eateries nearby having stayed at the hotel many times i like the attentiveness of the staff cleanliness of the rooms central location breakfast choice and valu for money towels were so rough they exfoliate with every use sheets could use some fabric softener too great location walked in hyde park every evening after dining at numerous restaurants nearby all varieties of food indian chinese italian malaysian starbucks too noise from fellow guests unhappy baby next door comfortable stay in a very central location nice clean environment well maintained by staff who are very helpful room certainly compact although it provides all the space required wonderful central location for access to attractions and good food nothing the staff were excellent in this busy hotel which clearly has a scottish family history breakfast was excellent plenty of staff available to bring tea coffee and a great choice aswell my stay was booked last minute and it will not be my last the location was just round the corncer form queensway tube great london hotel we were very disappointed in the size of the room even though we chose a superior double room also very disappointed in view from our window which was a very scruffy block of flats wonderful choice of breakfast beautiful frontage and reception area a room that was a matchbox for my money superior room not dirty nets curtains dated decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks no water in room for a  star hotel website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the   th floor wouldn t put my pet up there would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath i felt i wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel the entrance is one big front and not in a good way shaftsbury hotels will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again no positive only a little point the shower screen in our room could of been a little bigger to avoid wetting the floor so much this hotel was full of history and wonderful decor and original fixtures staff were very helpful and made us feel very welcome we had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after   we still had to wait although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer the bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing i enjoyed breakfast and the bed was comfortable the location of the room was quiet nice location and general appearance of the hotel was nice right next to hyde park and staff were really nice the room size and consequently the double bed were really small and somewhat restricting on movement so much so i could not pass my wife in any part of the room without one of us having to our move aside for the other the view out of the window was none existent as it was directly onto a wall less than  m away the location is great for access to the tube and walking distance to hyde park the breakfast was very good value with a help yourself buffet offering a good choice the rooms despite their size were very clean and our tiny bathroom has at some point recently been completely refurbished the fact because we booked threw you and ndt the hotel direct we had to pay   each for breakfast even though the hotel says breakfast is free for all our guesrs the bed was comfy and clean sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to we had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect everyhting aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem the building is gorgeous the staff are super helpful and it is excellent value for money especially in london it s around the same price as a generic chain hotel but so much nicer they even took our bags to the room for us the bathroom was so nice and clean and bright i was staying with my boyfriend and even though we re only   they treated us as well as anyone else which isn t the case at every place also breakfast was great everything you expect from a buffet room not as spacious as would have liked location was great managed to get to see everything we wanted to see within our two day stay staff at the hotel were very helpful and very pleasant a lot of stairs but the staff upgraded my room to a ground floor room lifts do not go to all floors bed comfy and ax worked great staff were very helpful nothing to fault the breakfasts were delicious the beds very comfy and we enjoyed the extras that came with our club room the staff was very welcoming and helpful the rooms are really tiny which does not make it a value for mony hotel i liked the staff as they are really friendly and professional and didn t like the room was very small decor rather shabby shower screen too small therefore floor got very wet friendly staff prompt efficient check in good shower good lighting in bathroom staff that don t speak english well seems to be the trend in london that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms had a room on  th fl which is reached via elevator to the  th and then a snakey passage with steps anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic the closet so small that   days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries those we had to lay on the suitcase rest the desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner it could have used a mini fridge underneath the last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed these were     beds smaller than a double and hard as rock i ordered an extra comforter to place on top it helped somewhat beautiful opulent old wood victorian interior restaurant is eye candy a spacious ballroom in two halves and the buffet excellent same things offered everyday however ordering a la carte is an option high end fixtures in the rooms and high quality furnishings hotel situated across the street from hyde park around the corner from two tube stations a multitude of restaurants and portebello road   minutes away the room was fitted with a safe and a kettle with coffee tea hot chocolate and biscuits room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc no positive room was very small difficult getting in and out the bed so close to the window view was awful staff were friendly booking in was easy breakfast was excellent the room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk the windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room moreover the air con didn t heat the room either the furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere the shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel i don t understand why people rate it so high i will not come back definitely not   stars in my opinion the location of the hotel is good but that s basically the only good thing about it creaky floors uncomfortable pillows leaking iron one staff member who delivered my iron when i asked does this not come with a board replied grumpily i was told to only bring iron and walked off in a huff to get an ironing board location some staff members reception look grand visually very teak mahogany basement room so i was disinclined to open window for air security wise outlook awful also noisy fridge buzzing away all night in cupboard beside bed clean as a whistle stuff poor very slow to check in the room very very small not as in the picture looks bigger and the bed very small for two the room was not very clean and towels really old and not clean well i will never come back to this hotel as all only location no thing else toilet was positioned so it could not be used for what it was designed for therefore we had to go elsewhere to use the toilet great location beautiful hotel i don t like to complain but the room was on the small side from our arrival we were made feel welcome and really enjoyed our stay so much the breakfast each morning was excellent the staff were brilliant nothing was any trouble to them certainly would come back again and recommend your hotel to others no negative the hotel is close to the tube stations and the hyde park the staff are very friendly the room is small but cozy the service is perfect at the reception the restaurant and the bar i like the breakfast bedroom was far too small and the bathroom was so small that you cannot get in without closing the door after you step halfway in just no space and silly steps right at the bedroom door to get to the bed hotel has character and clean with comfortable bed good location for access to the tube the price should come down by at least     a little extortionate i thought very clean and well kept luxurious in appearance very stylish staff looked immaculate and very professional very good service location was next to hyde park   minute walk to paddington station and a street away from a variety of food stores takeaways and restaurants place was a little noisey and the deluxe room was very small for the price the bed was hard location was great close to everything the traditional features were amazingno negative i have stayed in this hotel multiple times in the last few years and always i leave with the intension of returning very helpful staff great location excellent breakfast nice rooms well given it wasn t the hotel i booked i can t really say much about it despite having booked   days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy i was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in london hotels i realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms it happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller   for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that i stay in well it looked nice in reception but as i saw no more of it i ll have to take your word for how good it was cleaners walking in when i m half naked fire alarms going off first thing but no one bothered to say it was a mistake the room was awful breakfast was nice julian was great the room was tiny no bath the access to the room was blocked but staff did not tell me about the correct way to reach my room i was enrolled onto some premium club without explanation the hotel looks good just from the outsideno negative location excellent staff very helpful chocolates in the room when the receptionist found out it was my partners birthday really good experience i arrived late to be told had an upgrade to a room with a king size bed after the worlds slowest check in i opened my room door to find two twin beds i phoned reception to ask to be moved to a room with a double bed that i had booked reception informed they had no more rooms available however they would make my twin beds into a double the lady on reception and a waiter arrived to make the bed it took them   minutes meaning i didn t get into my room until    pm a night check out was incredibly slow the lady on the desk took around   minutes to check people out not a lot bathroom was clean friendly barman upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in paddington no explanation why but we refused given our triple deluxe room which was really poor cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy hotel is grand but room we experienced was   star lovely looking hotel just a stones throw away from hyde park and queensway tube station friendly staff excellent breakfast staff tried hardest to rectify issues see below told i had been upgraded to a large double from a single not enough room to open wardrobe door and you only had access to one side of the bed good location a little quirkyno negative julian at the front desk was magnificent in helping me to book for an additional night when i was under pressure a real ambassador for the hotel and the company perhaps the addition of other spaces like a gym ballroom or other public facilities would make it more appealing to more travelers the baroque interior design really added on to the atmosphere the bed was comfortable and the cheap buffet style breakfast also made it a very good deal the room which is supposed to be their deluxe room slightly bigger than the superior rooms according to this web site was way too small the facilities were not satisfactory no mini bar and no gym great location by the park very close to queensway tube station nice neighborhood in generalno negative we loved our stay here we only stayed one night of three in london and i wish we had spent every night here the staff was very friendly and helpful we were able to check in early which was really great after a horrible night at a hostel the night before the hotel also had complimentary umbrellas to use which is very useful for rainy weather in london when we come back to london we will stay here and most definitely recommend it to others cleanliness a little lacking dried globs of white stuff on drapes would not care to guess origin didn t notice until i pulled them shut too tired to change rooms location near done darling bars and cafes beautiful woodwork in lobby the room was exceptionally small you would not want to share this room with another person the shower didn t have a full screen so the bathroom floor got very wet no towel available to step onto from shower stairs going down into the room were very dangerous especially as i wasn t warned location air con didn t work shower head was loose run out off wine and beer meant to be a double room ended up being to single beds poorly spoken english speaking staff nice and clean hotel the floors squeezed a lot because of this we had to move from  th floor to  th floor staff in reception was very friendly location great next to a park and the tube superior double room over egging the description somewhat the rooms were small and cramped we liked the style of the hotel opulent and classic in the main areas lovely helpful staff very modern very clean bedrooms a little more room room was comfortable though couldn t swing a cat but had everything you could need staff were friendly and helpful good breakfast in a comfortable dining room no negative the hotel was very impressive the single room was as described very small but very clean the staff was very friendly and extremely helpful i did not have breafast at the hotel and did not use all the amenities on offer therefore no comment i shall definitely be back rooms are not spacious but typical for london otherwise room was fine the d cor of this hotel and the history of the building makes it stand out same architect as the ritz breakfast was very good and good value could have supplied more toiletries in the room room was small beds were comfortable room clean did the job ideal for business travel right next to hyde park so a real bonus one of our party was moved to a sister hotel after his room allegedly had no hot water we were not informed of this till check in i paid   for him a double delux room and what he actually got was once moved a shoe box they even tried to charge us again for the room on more the one occasion ordered room service   times none of which were correct my partner is dairy intolerant the sandwich she ordered had cheese in it even though it did not say that on the menu we were assured it would be removed from the bill howver we were charged on check out check out is  noon but was woken at    am by housekeeping wanting to clean our room good location the building is very old so not very practical for disabled or elderly guests as there are steps into the building and steps on each floor although there is a lift the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble the location of the hotel is perfect for visiting london s attractions and there are plenty of places to eat nearby we had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure this was true as soon as we arrived they tried to do it i needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took   minutes in giving as a room i think this is not very professional my husband also confirmed   months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it we also ask for an additional blanket on sunday and we needed to call twice to front desk in order they brought it we had it after almost   hour perfect cleaning of the room the small chunky cups and saucers bigger mugs please now i am being picky staff are brilliant i book here several times a year they always remember me nothing best sleep in ages in a hotel the style of the hotel was very welcoming also the staff were very good indeed to the customers especially luanna room very small despite being called a deluxe double feet hanging off the end of the bed bathroom small difficult to stand under the shower which mostly went on the floor also had open staircase in the room at the foot of the bed nice location friendly staff we didn t eat here so can t comment on dining rooms rather small but that s london very poor selection of tv stations bring your tablet and netflix location hyde park queensway batswater tube   mins away nice sitting area at off lobby clean rooms very squeaky floors both in own room and room above heard the noise from the corridor very easily too excellent staff lovely room comfy bed and very clean we were upgraded to a nicer room upon arrival spoilt the room quality is really bad very small and even there s no room available i was relocated to other address wasting much time and complicated staffs are helpful i was upgraded with no extra perks not sure how that is an upgrade did not find the staff to be as helpfull in fact one did not seem interested rooms need a paint as there is cracks in the ceiling location was great building is beautifull breakfast very good and waitresses very friendley nothing very welcoming staff helpful and friendly specially reception staff thanks to reception lady forget the name but starts with v and also breakfast in charge manager in fact whole team was very courteous and loving thanks to all quite expensive for what you get tiny room smaller than the cruise cabin we just finished the entire room tilted yes tilted the location was great lobby area and bar very nice and staff very helpful the bar had no amaretto two days running which was a disappointment to my guest club room very small bathroom tiny not a great view comfortable bed and pillows lovely bar and lounge area the room was extremely small for a twin room and very hot at night as they turn off the ac centrally and the room   only had a small window the young was closed for functions the staff were very nice and conscientious and accommodating they left chocolates and fruit in our room as i had communicated that it was a birthday week end the breakfast room and breakfast was very good the location is very good a couple of minutes from bayswater or queensway tube and close to paddington very small bathroom with a very very tiny sink practical location near to underground comfort of the bed very good breakfast for   if booked upon arrival instead of   impressive architecture and decoration at entrance and  st floor rooms are size of the locker and with the stairs onsude a  m  rooms feels like you are in the attic location style and staff rooms are clean airconditioning is normal bathrooms are modern water supply is good breakfasts are very good room was very small altough i got a better category and noisy from the floor above the bathroom was extremely small it was hard to close the door with me inside the room was a bit strange with stairs between the bathroom and the actual bedroom the windows also hadn t any view that with the room size it became a bit claustrofobic location is perfect   minutes from the subway central line and less than a block from the hyde park the maid tried to just walk into the room in the morning without knocking which i found to be rude and unprofessional the bed was comfortable and everything was to perfection room sizes were quite small we booked a superior room only to discover that this was equivalent to a standard room elsewhere location of hotel was very good just off the main bayswater road so not too noisy but just round the corner from the undergroundno negative all in all really good quiet place that is well connected to the public transport system nice breakfast room was tidy and the bed was adequate i d do it again club room was a bit small but perfectly adequate for a   night stay convenient location to london underground and transport hotel is stunning and the staff are very customer focused and helpful breakfast choices of both hot and cold food were excellent rooms are very quiet for a london hotel and close to hyde park free wifi tea and coffee making facilities in the room nothing i was impressed by all and everything concerning the staff they were helpful in providing information about how to get around london it s transit system everything from the moment of my arrival at the hotel the staff was very friendly courteous room and all was very nice would definitely book this location again great location best the room was on the small size staff very pleasent and helpful hotel is in a good area with plenty resturants and bars close by tube station few minutes walk away plus hyde park room small but hey this is london excellent location   min walk from queensway and central line tube clean room with all you need comfy bed tea coffee facilities hot water for a good shower hairdryer tv very friendly staff no signal for mobile lower ground floor always had to come out of building to make a phone call excellent atmosphere nice building excellent beds beautiful lobby the air con seemed to make a bad smell come into the room at one point which we reported it disappeared when we turned it off loved the architectural decor beautiful ceilings and the historyno negative the room was to small and the bed wasn t conforteble the window was bringing cold air and the heating sistem wasn t working at all the hand basic was blocked ect we booked double supreme but were allocated with a twin double on top of that room was no way near dusted we could see that dust flying all over in the room next night was far better because we got a club room yet again with twin single beds but room nice tidy spacious lovely breakfast but had hair in my partner s mushrooms we were given a fresh breakfast though with apologies from the manager mr sehgal a great chap the rooms are small there is not enough space to move around the staff are very friendly especially the two ladies in reception luann and cynann they are very helpful and make sure that all your comforts are looked after a special thanks to the concierge staff mr robert who was always willing to help with a smile on his face the entire team is aptly managed by mr ankur who ensures that you leave with pleasant memories a big thank you to all at grand royale london hyde park hotel we will come back again next year room slightly small but comfortable and well presented the old colonial style decoure is lovely and the lounge and bar areas is a lovely place to have a drink staff were happy to sever drinks when o got back late even though the bar was shut the room is very small it is hard to walk if we open just one luggage the bed is also very small and uncomfortable if you live underground it could be so depressive the location is near to the subway station so it is very convenient for travelers there are also sainsbury s tesco asian supermarket and many restaurants near the hotel the air circulation was pretty bad in our room the small window only opened a tiny bit and this was a cause of discomfort due to lack of fresh air the staff were very helpful and friendly and the location is great as hyde park is literally on the doorstep the tube station is   mins walk away also many shops and restaurants close by for convenience on arrival they offered an upgrade to what they said was a larger room the room was the size of a shoe box and the bed was described as a double to which it wasn t at one point in the night i woke up with my partners elbow in my mouth as literally no room in the bed definitely not worth   for   night and not even breakfast oh and the shaver sockets don t workno positive our room was quite small but included bed desk and bathroom with very little space really friendly staff that gave excellent service would recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in london my room was very small but to be expected for a london hotel staff were excellent very friendly and helpful the hotel was   mins from the tube station which was excellentno negative this was our second visit after being impressed last year beautiful building with ornate carved wooden panelling the staff were very helpful rooms very comfortable and breakfast is excellent close to the underground for the city centre and opposite hyde park for a stroll i upgraded from a standard room but what i got was still pathetic a room no bigger than  x  with a pretend window that opened into a corridor i shudder to think what i would ve had if i hadn t upgraded location is perfect came for an early check in but the room was not ready staff had told to wait in the front lounge but never came back for any updates the room was at  th floor which was great upgraded the room by   to a deluxe sized room which was significantly larger everything was great toilet was superb love the hotel alot i would come again for sure room was a bit on small side but obviously you don t spend much time in there     charge for large bottle of water think that s probably normal for room service but tad overpriced in my opinion staff very friendly and helpful hotel is beautiful the theatre bar is gorgeous location is on a quiet road but close to tube and other shops and places to eat the room and bathroom are very tight impossible to walk between the bed and furniture suitcases on the floor bathroom sink is ridiculously small with pullout bed in this suite there is no room to get around this is not really a hotel no dining room only used for breakfast the lobby sitting room is dark and not our taste adam s family gothic not a good sign to see people standing on the doorsteps smoking when we arrived looking out the window of pullout bedroom window is no joy dirty and stack of empty water bottles manager was very helpful to try and make things better for our disappointment with the room and facilities unfortunately there was nothing better available even in other property they manage no negative excellent hotel very well managed with a very friendly staff many thanks to syn ann roberta and all other staff i was particularly impressed with their speed in solving unexpected issues by finding customer friendly solutions room was clean bed comfortable breakfast was great very close to public transportation and to hyde park i recommend this hotel without any reservation no negative a great selection for breakfast myself and my son were able to drop our bag in early and our room was ready too the staff were friendly close to bayswater and queensway tube stations and a few minutes walk into hyde park ref room     strong noise specially from bathroom s ceiling spreading into bedroom at night seriously disturbing proper sleep cause aeration system   poor lightening system the location poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier comfortable bed and good shower impressive entrance despite initial appearance and online room photos room was very small for the price paid and compared to what was shown and expected for this   star hotel dissappointing beautiful building with stunning lobby nothing the hotel is steeped in history relating to edwardvii and lily langtry and the owners have cleverly merged and preserved the old aspects of the building with a modern hotel eg the entrance dining room bar paintings and staircase the staff on reception were superb polite friendly and very helpful the room was very good clean with plenty of toiletries and tea coffee plus a fridge breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices the hotel is nicely situated close to hyde park and with frequent buses into the central london staff were friendlier this time than last but a smile would still make all the difference just do some basic staff training in courtesy and friendliness great bar and residents lounge unique smart small modern rooms but no smaller than is the norm for this quality of hotel in london it is london that most expensive of cities in a tiny country where living space is at a premium needs complete renovation very shabby short beds literally although i m not a tall person  m  blinds were broken even in the superior room staff was excellent very friendly this is not   star max   star the room was incredibly small so was the bed my husband is over  ft so half his legs were hanging off the end staff were lovely really friendly and very helpful we were also upgraded on arrival which was lovely no negative the reception staff and management were simply too amazing they saw to our needs even when it went beyond their policies they made our stay so homey and would definetly return i was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that i would have to be accommodated in a sister property there was mild surprise i had not received prior informatio but that did not ring true i politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised i needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point i had booked in inverness terrace because that was where i wanted to be this was poor stuff and i would like your comments as the booking agents you have always served me well in the past moira lawson the breakfast was superb with all the hot food piping but amazingly not over cooked the ambience of the building is amazing and as a history buff i love the historical associations the club room an upgrade was very small especially the bathroom it took a bit of getting used to but the pros still outweighed the cons we re coming back in june the staff were very friendly and helpful cyn ann even arranged a return booking for a party of     rooms for   nights in june at a nice price the room was very clean and functional despite its size and the price was good for central london headroom in shower also two inch gap at bottom of bedroom door had to fill gap with towel to stop light flooding in when we put lights off good location close to tube walked to kendington chelsea and portobello road market notting hill wifi ok given age of hotel concierge looked after our bags when we checked out until later on sunday when we left for home the rooms are extremely small as i had booked superior double i was disappointed but didn t let it ruin the trip i suppose this is to be expected in london for the price the bed was definitely comfortable hotel itself has a nice old traditional english feel to it location just opposite hyde park was fantastic the room was very very small upon arrival i was told that i was upgraded to club room this room was extremely small god only know the size of my original room lovely setting and decor it rained on the monday on arrival for our   day stay there was an issue with room availability this was not a problem as they provided a room at their sister hotel in kensington for the first night we came back the next day to spend the last   days of our london visit here the hotel staff could not have been more helpful or nice and i would like to thank pranav one of the managers at the hotel who looked after us during our stay i highly recommend this hotel and i look forward to my next visit here a great location excellent breakfast and a unique theater bar on the ground floor where the great lillie langtry performed have one of the house cocktails on the stage that lillie graced with her presence the room was very very small didnt have any great expectations but i could almost touch all   walls while sitting on the double bed handy location next to the underground clean rooms with comfy beds breakfast was pretty good as well for london it was fairly good value for money mattress needs replacing sagging in the middle and could feel a spring couldn t open blinds the traditional furnishings beautiful common areas near reception on the doorstep of hyde park and queensway station couldn t find a remote control and could not activate the air con the room was compact but clean and had extra touches in the bathroom which were appreciated room was very small but the price was good so i guess that reflects the room size bed was good no bath towels and it took a couple of phone calls to obtain some noisy road works quite early in the morning maintenance came to look at the shower whilst i was in it room wasn t all that big and we d been upgraded but was fine for what we needed decor was lovely nice clean room helpful staff good location really liked the theatre bar for our pre theatre drinks the bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower we stayed for   nights at the beginning of the easter break and the grand royale hotel was in a good location it was easy to jump on the tube line and buses which were a few minutes away we stayed in a club room which was comfortable and clean too much noise around the room contact the duty manager but never reported back i had to call hik another   times to send someone to check it very noisy at all time in morning no positive ineffective heater in the room shower cubicle too small and close to the ceiling very small rooms being told that the hotel was too full and i would have to move to a hotel close by charming building good location nothing to report excellent location next to queensway underground station on the most convenient central line in london very polite and helpful staff i highly recommend this very historic hotel we were told that our room had been upgraded i would not have liked to stay in the previous one the room was very small and had no air conditioning making it very hot beautiful edwardian building with an interesting history breakfast was great value with plenty of choices for both british and continental we did have to move due to not having a double twin as booked but they moved us to a sister hotel in the area included breakfasts and couldn t be more apologetic or helpful excellent service great breakfast efficient staff clean and modern room was small but extremely comfortable the only thing i would say is the room was very small really not what i expected for a club double could have have also done with a little decoration in places might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small one other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with the hotel is a beautiful old building and the staff were extremely helpful couldn t do enough for you and very polite the breakfast was fantastic just about anything you could possibly want the room was clean and tidy tiny rooms and unfortunately i had an unpleasant case with staff on reception my friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left so after spending   minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them i didnt expect that this could happen in london very beautiful interior in lobby perfect location for those who love hyde park close to   tube stations and city center yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit london you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room well i don t anyways the location was absolutely fantastic couldn t have got better rooms were lovely and clean and lots of character within the hotel the location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly the room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none the towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that i develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable the location lay out staff i booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom the sink was so small why bother when i leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me what idiot designed that love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable the bathroom could have been made     metre wider and had a decent wash basin puts me off staying again staff location facilities old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night draughts could also be felt coming through the windows the hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself i liked the charm of the traditional styled reception areas our room was furnished in a modern style and it was clean the location of the hotel was great for tube stations bayswater and queensway are really close by attractions like kensington palace hyde park and the royal albert hall were also really close too there is a good selection of restaurants close by for dining out having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe friendly helpful staff working desk space in room not really usable because to small very stylish location and very nice breakfast buffet for the price rooms fairly small but nicely done and without functional errors the size of the room of course we re in london and i ve slept even in smaller rooms but still i can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained there was a nasty damp smell in the room the windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped great position few minutes walk from the tube good breakfast buffet comfortable bed but i was on my own i guess this was a double bed in which case it guess it can only house a tiny couple a little cold at night because i did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning my own fault but the print is small spacious suite and ample bath swift repair of faulty tv excellent breakfast breakfast was quite expensive location was great queensway underground station was   minutes away staff at the frontdesk was extremly kind and helpfull rooms were small but has everything you need instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room the hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful the room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms i have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space i found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay at checkout time the staff were politely informed that i could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst i went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from london which was most appreciated overall i had an enjoyable stay at the grand royale london park hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to london   no refrigerator in the room had to keep some food i bought with the receptionist   the lower ground floor room was noisy because of poor insulation i could hear people who were walking on the pavement   no shower curtains   very small room no positive the room was besides the housekeeping store up from   am it was loud and hard to sleep clean room small but fine for one person nice bathroom prefect location better quality toiletries even if it s an additional cost eg overnight toiletries from moulton brown or another quality make would have saved me the hassle of bringing my own the staff were extra attentive helpful and professional my room   very comfortable the breakfast was exceptional fresh and vast selection fantastic grand hotel no negative access to kensington gardens and hyde park was only steps away and was the underground and trains to bond street and oxford circus also it was an easy walk to notting hill gate quite and comfortable room and bed tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at smiling staff couldn t do more to help quirky atmosphere love the victorian entrance there seemed to be huge communication difficulties we asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve i lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double by this time it was about    am the receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast at breakfast we asked for   coffee   teas and   fruit tea we got   coffee and two fruit teas when i pointed out the mistake we were brought   more tea at this point we gave up and my daughter and i shared the tea when we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it not good we very nearly missed the train all in all it was quite tiresome location was lovely the building was beautiful the staff were very friendly polite and helpful the rooms were small and very tired all needs refurbishment my initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed the quilt was too small for the bed and i could hear people talking asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated have stayed in better hotels in london for less a good size bath close to hyde park and train station very small bed small shower with a light very close above the showerhead toilet stuck around the side of the shower and a small room to boot also the fire alarm going off at       am just finished things off lovely great location decent bar nothing could have been better the attention to detail provided by the staff at all levels the courtesy they offer where nothing is too much trouble for them the comfort of the beds and the provision of slippers and towelling robes denotes real quality the room rates are excellent for such good service in a central london location we always choose this hotel when coming to london because it cannot be bettered the bathroom was small so if you are some over   foot just be aware there is not much room for you the location is amazing next to hyde park and the tube stop is very easy to get to this is definitely the one of the better hotels for it s price no negative selected the hotel for the location and the photos but has been re located to a near by hotel from the same group at first disappointed but grand roal paddington turned out to be a perfect one the offers did not include breakfast you would rather buy a full package this was an unexpected surprise location good facilities good location near the subway good neighborhood located next to a nice park the mattress was hard and you could feel the springs and the cornered handrail in the bath was impractical because you keep on catching your back on it the victorian paneling in the public area and public d cor and the service was great bedroom very small cupboard in wrong place as left small floor space to bed english language a problem for some staff to understand breakfast very good great selection of food and drink great breakfast room absolutely nothing negative to say friendly welcoming helpful staff disabled relative supplied with excellent support throughout visit room very clean spacious beds and bedding extremely comfortable all facilities supplied to a high standard food delicious and plentiful looking forward to another visit in the future superior double for   couldn t swing a cat couldn t even get dressed without hitting the wall with an elbow quilt just reached edge to edge would have been a fight for two no positive i had a lower ground floor and you could hear the underground trains below not the only hotel to have this though good central location and good helpful welcoming staff nearby restaurants the bedroom was really cold and had single glazing apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning that wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room our room was at the front of the hotel and i had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny the bedroom door couldn t even open fully the location was good the bed was comfortable size of room was small even when i was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues size of bathroom also very small hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls requires more lighting nice firm mattress room decor was okay bathroom was modern only thing was the room was a little small with no view a brick wall with a picture on it the location was excellent just around the corner from the tube station staff were really helpful and the bar even showed the football late saturday afternoon we were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back we never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment really nice location located in the center what they call a superior double room is a box room i wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that   rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room we put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room as we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order how many other people have they tried this on it s value for money if you re not messed around nice communal areas staff pleasant welcome at reception wasn t great room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for   nights bathtube needs bigger screen no mini fridge gorgeous building great links with   tube stations on different lines good quality value breakfast selection of places to eat nearby bag hold gave us another full day in london before our train at  pm  pm check out love a lay in no opening window or view was probably the only downside but it was a cold few days and to be honest i was staying there while attending a conference so the view wasn t so important clean if small room very helpful front of house staff convenient location and nice feel to the main entrance lounge areas comfortable bed the rooms are far too small for a couple i have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room staff was extremely kind and the breakfast was good the price of the room was quite below london average special offer the only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort the breakfast choice was wonderful and if you book before the day its only   per head the hotel is very close to a tube station on the central line making transport to various locations ideal room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed i d hate to have seen my booked room later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given our room we were tripping over ourselves no room for our cases room smelled of smoke for over a day staff was very aloof hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day location close to tube paddington bed was comfortable i found x  body hairs in my bathroom which were not mine this was really not good the location was good for my hyde park meeting and the employees were mostly friendly and helpful small room for the money paid more was expected wouldn t recommend for this reason we were told on arrival that we were being given a free upgrade but i hate to think what our original booking was if this was considered an improvement location was good on arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms when we got to our room is was very small we had barely enough room to walk around the bed we had booked a superior room so i d hate to think how small this would have been having said that it was very clean and comfortable location was perfect very close to everything and staff were very friendly hotel itself is well maintained and clean with a lovely bar however when we were there it was very empty room bathroom quite small which wasn t an issue as we didn t spend much time there floorboards were very creaky we could hear the guests upstairs moving around didn t really impact too much on our stay though excellent location convenient to busses trains underground close to museums hyde park comfortable bed very clean quick check in great staff this weekend was booked for a gift for my father in laws  th birthday i saaid this on the booking i was disapponted to know they had a       hour wait for the room and the room was like a box so the whole point of a special weekend was slightly over shadowedno positive was upgraded to a club room but this was still minute couldn t walk around the bed paid more for a family room but extra space was not around the bed don t try to check in early staff had poor english unexpected fresh flowers wine and water robes and slippers in room beautiful reception rooms lovely hotel well situated for what we needed lots of attention to detail our ground floor room was very small great hotel location was ideal for our needs faultless friendly staff comfy bed would stay again one of our group said the breakfast was very good upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems the hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star the tv had bad reception room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night the room was extremely small and closet space inadequate breakfast was fair with limited selection no positive room was absolutely tiny despite been told we had been upgraded to a club room the toilet was far too small especially the actual size of the shower the service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow and food was bad no positive check in process was long could do with extra staff in busy periods to help out room was small but not much different in size to the standard london hotel room a clean and modern bedroom a nice bar and excellent helpful staff great location very near tube stations everything else poor wine in the evening cold room heating wasn t working on a sub zero february night no where to box and a box room you couldn t swing a cat in proximity to tube station and hyde park good shower i hated the bathroom taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room staff was not very welcoming location close to subway station size of the bed and room reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served   or   people while i was trying to pay bed and room was very small seemed like a large single sized bed bar was nice and cozy and open all the time close to queensway tube station which was handy quiet area rooms were small but still everything you need was there didn t realise how much you could squeeze into the tiniest bathroom i have ever seen great location easy reach of places what the description says is exactly what you get the size of the room was a bit tight for   adults but yet sufficient for good rest the location was great just across from wonderful hyde park the kensington palace and more we are pretty fast walkers so for us this was an ideal location we accessed so many places from this easy navigable location it is a short distance from the tube subway the hop on hop off buses restaurants pharmacy health food stores coffee shops grocers and more the hospitality was incredible robert greeted us and offered help with our luggage as soon as we entered the historical lobby which was quaint with rich woods and great architectural detail lauren roberta and others who worked the front desk were there to ensure a great stay for us they were always ready to assist with directions and suggestions regarding what to see and do in london the beautiful and classy and clean dining rooms offered breakfast which was plentiful and varied with hot and cold options that would satisfy most any traveler the servers were very attentive to the diners needs the stairway adjacent to the lobby is full of architectural charm including alfresco paintings on the ceiling beautiful wood is used throughout the stairwell there s a library or huge drawing room adjacent to the lobby i imagine a great deal of friends have gathered there over the years the bed was very comfortable i don t approve of the staff removing plates from the table when the other person is still eating the british way is both plates are removed at the same time i found this made my experience of my meal very uncomfortable which is a shame because the food was lovely the hotel was spotless and although the rooms are small they are nicely laid out breakfast was excellent i didht luke the rooms r very tiny and i didht like the reception girl martha which when i ask her to change room ahe lie to me and she told me is overbooked and dont have other room but when i speak with the manager suddenly she washt overbooked the hotel and i change room i like a lot the bar in the breakfast it was good rooms were awful hotel pulls you in with the nice looking lobby them boom your trapped in a small box that s barely of   quality also hotel cancelled first reservation so while i was half way to london i had to book another room wish i d booked a different hotel as that should have been a sign very disappointed decor look of reception lobby and bar the bathroom was not clean enough the windows were not well insulated so cold air kept creeping under them the bathroom smell was musky the ventilation was not working the front lobby was impressive nothing to add here the friendly and helpful staff the fact that when the rate filed and we phone the reception they had someone onto it straight away and the following evening a bowl off fruit was delivered to our room the location ease of a walk in hyde park plenty of places to eat or to purchase food it was quiet mould around window and window was dirty and also couldnt get in safe in wardrobe as the bed amd side cabinet was too close for  st time in london was a nice pleasant place to stay room was smaller than expected bathroom was very cramped in particular and shower was rubbish good mix of classic building reception etc with a modern room on arrival the hotel room was not clean i was very disappointed also it did ruin my evening in saying that the way it was dealt with was brilliant i am extremely grateful for the night manager and some of the staff as they made it right as soon as they could the hotel staff were great night manager extremely helpful and the breakfast was fantastic the room a deluxe double was just off the main staircase with a potentially injurious lack of space between the door to the room and the door to the staircase the window looked out on the acces ramp of an underground car park and service entrances to restaurants on queensway making it noisy and insalubrious deluxe is not a word i would have used great hotel in terms of staff food and ambience in the communal areas fantastically located a few minutes walk to two tube stations seconds from kensington gardens and only  min walk or  min tube ride to paddington and trains to heathrow the west country and south wales the grande royale is also reasonably priced and comfortable for the area there was no space under the bed for my to hide and prank my girlfriend the doors the shower gel the fact that the kettle was already plugged in before my arrivalno negative beautiful architecture and furnishings big bed good shower seating area in rooms very comfortable stay would stay there again great location bedroom very small clean and comfortable with nice bathroom but small good location charming edwardian style building and decor good breakfast for   if you booked it the night before instead of the quoted   i think this may be a london wide problem and i also have good hearing but i could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning the room could have been a bit cleaner i think the turn around is very busy there seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish i expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a   london hotel and   there was a slight mix up with our room but the manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time i return to london any points i didn t like are simply little things the staff were very helpful reception porters and especially the breakfast staff head waitress the manager was also very helpful and has since followed up with me to check i was happy during my stay not many places would do this the location of the hotel is great easily accessible close to main attractions beautiful decor in the lobby stairs breakfast great selection fresh tasty plenty of comfort in the room e g bath robe to use slippers etc bathroom although small very nice i would really recommend staying here great value service breakfast location n a excellent service and incredible room we were upgraded to the lilly langtry suite due to a surprise marriage proposal this made our special night even more memorable outstanding service breakfast was overpriced for what you got and the room was very small location was excellent nice welcoming items in room when you arrive water and fruit n a we didn t stay there long enough to notice anything we didn t like it was great for us the room was petite and perfect for us its location was great you ve got two station on the next road with a lot of eateries will definitely go back again rooms nice but small drinks expensive and overpriced helpfull staff lounges very nice and comfortable good breakfast food very nice room very clean and tidy the rooms were small however for the amount of time we spent there it really didnt matter location way more important beds were comfortable and it was spotlessly clean excellent location staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel saw it was my birthday while i was there and went out of their way to make it special upgraded me to a club room to stay in the room adjacent to my parents who were also there chocolates in the room and a happy birthday message we had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom not child friendly or suitable for disabled access location was good the double bed was something else the mattress was extremely hard we hardly slept at all the bedcover was very thin and not wide enough to cover two people we would not stay there again lovely old building at first impression in the lobby the room was very small but clean with all the usual things like kettle tea etc also shower gel soap shampoo the only thing that could have been better was the floor in the room was incredibly loud when we walked on it other than that we had a fantastic time staff were fantastic brought when bag up to my room the bedroom was beautiful small but just what e wanted the lobby was a beautiful old victorian style that i couldn t keep my eyes off of the hotel was close to restaurants and the tube and just steps for kensington gardens that are beautiful to walk through i would stay there again creaky floors but only to be expected given the age of the property very friendly helpful staff interesting atmospheric interior room bathroom small but clean room was very small wardrobe was tiny no shower curtain meant bathroom floor got soaked every time the shower was on wallpaper was being applied to the corridors during our entire stay bed was comfortable bathroom was clean liked having tea and coffee in the room reception and lounge architecture was spectacular room was tiny hardly enough space to walk round the bed on one side bedding and towels were tired not of the quality expected in a   hotel staff were very professional heating was very good room warmed up or cooled down quickly unhappy with what was described as a luxury room no room to walk around bed amazed to see what you can squeeze into a small space we would hate to have been even slightly over weight no positive problems with holding deposits for hotel room we stayed in on second floor one side of corridor bit small for a couple staying smell of smoke in room staff were excellent with help and requests and when hotel was full we got complimentary breakfasts for duration of stay as we were moved to sister hotel for one night i think the walls and insulation are not too good as i could hear the guy in the next room hanging his clothes and snoring early in the morning room was small but very adequate liked the nice touch of having some fruit in the room room quite small could nt make water empty from bath tiny bathroom the entrance and lobby area are stunning lovely smell of fresh lilies comfortable lounge they had called me before i arrived to transfer me to another hotel because they have a maintenance work but i refused it took me   minutes to check in my room was deluxe but they upgrade it to club room which was so small the bathroom area was about     m by   m the sink was so small like a large soup plate and its was hard to adjust the tube to get warm water no phone signal at all because my room was in basement good location friendly staff quiet place good wifi well the staff were quite rude they got my information wrong and even told my girlfriend what i had ordered when it was meant to be a surprise food was cold morning and night and was interrupted twice by staff building the rooms where fine great service from manager after experiencing difficulties the staff at the reception was rude i had checked my account before leaving to go to the hotel and had seen that they had charged me according to the policy i had booked under the receptionist then informed me that this was not the case and that they were going to charge me again constantly telling me the first charge was a pre authorisation he was not willing to listen this was a frustrating and bad start to our stay the rooms are small which i was expecting due to it being in the centre of london but i did not appreciate the fact that the beds were not long enough going to the toilet was pretty much impossible there is no space at all they supply a kettle in the room but the tap in the bathroom is so small that you cannot fill the kettle there we had to use the showerhead not good the hotel looks beautiful on the outside window didn t close properly and it was freezing at night mattress is awful duvet is really low quality duvet cover does not fit the duvet and linen do not fit the mattress noisy corridor room and bathroom are tiny staff are not very nice common places are impressive and the building is remarkably magnificent for such a cheap hotel arrival check in we were moved to a sister hotel due to a problem with the water heating and should stay there for the hole trip but insisted on going back room very small but ok for london location perfect breakfast good selection staff friendly the temperature of the room could have been more adjustable it was cold night and higher temp of the room would have been better comfy bed room was clean when i turned up i was put in someone else s room then when complained they said the room i had booked was being refurbished was very disappointed then the room we ended up with was very poor window wouldn t stay open had to wedge open with a spoon single size quit on double bed the location was great unfortunately painters working on our floor but were ever so polite initially my assigned room   had steps leading up to the bed area also toilet was tiny and didn t appear to be room i booked as had single wardrobe however staff quickly offered me another room location was excellent reception staff very very welcoming and professional robert the porter so helpful also the others rooms although small were so clean also bathrooms had tea making facilities and well stocked excellent value for money booking not honoured involuntarily transferred on arrival to associated hotel  m away which while adequate lacked the character of the grand royale no prior consultation unacceptable no positive small rooms and bright lights from the smoke alarm fixtures that kept us up for most of the night if you need darkness to sleep request a room with a bed away from the smoke alarm management accommodated for burst pipes by providing a free upgrade and taxi to our evening destination good location and building the reception staff were not sufficiently supervised and were inconsistent in resolving or responding to guests enquiries the modern bedrooms and traditional reception rooms made the hotel very welcoming bit difficult to get to by tube from kings cross and other london attractions like harrods covent garden etc requires at least one change of train room was basement level and bathroom was really small beautiful hotel with very ornate classical features bed was really comfy and breakfast was delicious we were lied to on arrival we were told that they tried to call us because the was maintenance taking place in some rooms that was untrue as had no missed calls really ruined our special weekend the lounge area and reception because these are the only part of the hotel we got to see i was very disappointed that we had to be moved without notice to a sister hotel nothing like what i had booked pillows a bit flat proximity to queensway tube station and restaurants in bayswater makes this ideal nice hotel renovated rooms clean neat rooms small but perfectly functional for overnight stay the room is very small the location closed to underground station and a lots of restaurant and shops nearby the staffs are very friendly and helpfull the size of the rooms are tiny particularly the bathroom loved the history of this hotel the reception area and lounge very grand with the wood panelling and chesterfield sofas the theatre bar is nice for a quiet drink very unusual the room above me had a squeaky floorboard which woke me up during the night as the occupant was walking around but i did let the hotel know so hopefully it s been fixed great location friendly staff clean modern room good breakfast as well first room had a very noisy extractor fan outside it and i had to be moved this was done with no fuss and very quickly good location on two underground lines room was a good size for a london hotel and well equipped staff were very professional and friendly i got a upgrade to a club room which is basically in the basement don t recommend getting that room it was really run down and just kinda filthy it says it was a non smoking hotel but i constantly smelled smoked in my room the shower was really small and the bed uncomfortable the only thing i liked was the location of the hotel i think the guy working in the bar  th feb night around  pm has some problem i ordered for the drink but he only served to other customers and i asked twice for the drink again he only said if you just sit down there i will bring up the drink and then i just left after   mins waiting and wasting since he has been serving other customers continually but not to me the bar was not even busy at all the hotel service was great they are very helpful they had some maintaining problems when we arrived but a replacement and complements were very properly provided and we were pleased for the extra service during the our staying the room was however unexpectedly small but the good service quality may fulfil for any inconvenience there was a problem with the security system in bedroom   this caused some concern with the maintence team and my friend the breakfast was excellent the staff were very attentive food was good we would like to do a return visit to the grand when we arrived we were sent to another hotel because of some rooms being out of order we didn t like this since the other hotel was of a lower standard the room was tiny and the breakfast wasn t very good especially the coffee was bad just not what we booked but on the next day we went back to the grande royal to tell them of our dissatisfaction and they offered us an upgraded room and free breakfast for the rest of our stay we really appreciated this gesture thank you very much the staff was very helpful and the breakfast was very good quality and generous the grande royal is a really special and beautiful old building bathroom was a bit tiny front desk were kind and helpful location is amazing sitting on hyde park   meters from the metro station would definitely return the corridors were too small and the floor was creaking which was annoying i like the old vintage look around the office area and main lounge it had a cosy feel the adminstration it is very bad when you book with a hotel and just before arrival they call to feel you that you are going to be transferred for another hotel with same standard and you find that the room is a disabeled small room and you paid for a double room and you contact them back they don t respond the room was too small and had steep steps inside the room the bed was small specially duvet was very small the night receptionist was trying to help decor was grubby in places our room   club room was a bit small limited beer selection in theatre bar checkout was very slow and the background music in reception was dreadful the style and finish of the main areas theatre bar breakfast bathroom in room nice tv and free wifi shower not great didn t complain though as didnt have time drain was clogged and the shower tray filled with water which was gross room was ok reception lovely the staff who booked us in was very unfriendly and the rooms are really tiny it s hard to even move in the room location is perfect and hotel entrance cleanliness of the rooms bar shut      pm when you wanted to relax in nice surroundings and finish your evening off bar staff clearly told you it was shut pulled the shutter down and were very abrupt relaxing elegant bar lounge areas great location great choice at breakfast hotel has low scruples phoned me  hours before check in to say they wanted to move me to their paddington hotel due to hot water system being broken asked for discount and they told me they would ask another guest to move there was no problem with the hot water also superior double room was so small less than   between window and bed handy for hyde park and tube hotel let us extend checkout to  pm the stairs in the room got old after the first night but we didnt want to move rooms we couldnt control the heat in the room and got uncomfortably hot each night perfect location very close to a tube station and entrance to the park updated rooms great staff beautiful hotel rooms are a bit smaller than we expected but this was not so big deal super location and i real like the design of the hotel friendly staff and breakfast was very tasty room on first night very small and very hot air con not working if i had known room so small i would of paid more for better room thankfully got upgraded to bigger room second night staff very friendly n helpful lovely hotel around entrance and lounge areas unorganised unprepared and disrespectful reception my room jey was always not working the shower leaked water the toilet seat uncomfortable very small and noisy room unnecessary stairs in the room the hall way was like a puzzle to get to your room very low security from reception at night the host who helped with the bag doesn t understand what tissue means i only liked the location size of room and staff general unfriendliness staff not overly friendly and one of the descriptions regarding on site parking on their android app is not accurate breakfast is fine and although the rooms are very small it is a comfortable enough hotel when we arrived we had two singles pushed together rather than the double i had booked they remade the bed for us when we where out turning the bed into a kingsize as could be zipper together lovely quirky hotel close to the tube station and not far from the west end breakfast was very nice if not a little prices the size of the room for a double deluxe far to small bath had chips n rust shower went everywhere in the bathroom due to hardly any shower protection the staff who booked us in very unfriendly no smile or helpfulness the bed was comfortable the price for one night plus breakfast was over   pounds the room was tiny too small room in the breakfast room the receptionists are not helpful and most of them are impolite only the breakfast was fine to some extent the shower in our room was to small excellent hotel in an excellent location close to bars shops and restaurants plus tube station was only a couple of minutes away there were a lot of stairs even getting into the front door a doorman would have been nice with my huge heavy suitcase lovely historical place staff couldn t do enough for us room was small staff were amazingly friendly arrived at  am after a night out in london and i was offered a slice of pizza and a lovely welcome quaint gothic charm and decor modern furnishings in room convienient location close to bayswater and paddington station excellent value for money i booked a single room   and it was a bit small i will definately use the hotel again as am in london on average twice a month but will book a double room the price was competitive for a   night stay and hotel is a great standard very friendly staff who we re happy to help room very small and although the rooms are modern in comparison to the old building it was pretty scruffy in lots of places finish of carpet lots of marks on walls shabby blinds dirty doors etc and could really do with a refresh bathroom was modern but really tiny regularly stay in london but i wouldn t stay here again beautiful communal areas lovely building staff friendly and polite and check in was very easy chocolates and fruit platter were a nice touch theatre bar is beautiful the room size was adequate but the bathroom was too small and the shape made it difficult to use the very small sink and toilet ideally located with close proximity to tube station  m they need to change their preferred taxi service stunningly beautiful reception area and very friendly staff rooms were small expected in london but very comfortable room a bit small but couldn t be helped the staff were totally amazing both efficient and very friendly rooms very clean and well maintained quiet location wonderful old building with old world fittings like arches and wood paneled lounge breakfast also very nice we had a room at the back of the hotel and vehicles kept reversing early in the morning so you would be woken by the beeping lovely reception and common areas also great location and finally fantastic value nothing centrally location for visit ease of check in out politeness and helpfulness of all staff atmosphere within the hotel breakfast very goodno negative from the staff customer service to cleanliness to location and amenities everything was perfect we got upgraded for our anniversary which was a very nice touch choose this hotel and you won t be disappointed our room was very small the floorboards from the room above made a lot of noise which was annoying and made it hard to sleep the shower needed a curtain or glass wall our bathroom keep flooding from the water in the shower the location was great the staff were always very friendly the room was clean room was extremely small considering what we paid for the room myself and my partner kept bumping into each other when trying to walk around in the room due to limited space and layout no positive nothing very good value for money fabulous bedroom stayed in the lilly langtry room happy hour each evening staff very accommodating breakfast wonderful rest room in the old room was very small to extinct u can t sit on the toilet the keeping house manager was more than perfect once i told them that the bed sheets were not that clean they upgraded the room and left me a box of chocolate rooms were very small but we knew this from previous reviews we looked at before booking however even the bathroom was very small and not much space to move around with two of us in there no iron or mini fridge in our room the location was ideal acsess to two different tube stops near by in zone   and plenty of things to do in the local area staff were friendly and answered all my questions good price for central london room very clean no negative came for   night stay for my birthday with fiance on arrival room was upgraded room to a suite letter of welcome box of chocolates and bottle of wine in room from general manager decor is stunning throughout especially the beautiful theatre bar got a great last minute deal through booking com so all this for less than a travelodge rooms fine nothing grand about them the barman wasn t particularly friendly but that maybe down to his   hour shift the lobby area was beautiful reasonably priced comfortable room but shower room a bit on the small side great location being about  yds from queensway tube with easy access to central london great character with lots of history especially the theatre bar helpful and friendly staff the room was clean and comfortable however was a little tight for space makes me wonder how small our original room was friendly staff could offer us an early check in and an up graded room free of charge i wonder who gave the   to this upsolutely auwful   motel the room was like a cage and was on the lowest floor under the earth that made the walls of the room blowing cold air even if the ac was at   c it was freezing also the ac was loud extremely loud and above all the bathroom was with noooooo heating system winter in london   to   c are you serious its not only

noooooo heating system winter in london   to   c are you serious its not only decieving but impertinent not even even if sbd payed me i would stay there i accept your apology so what thebasement rooms

deluxe in a a   sure not that was not a room that was where you put your garbage no negative the hotel is beautiful and has some stunning features xx it s quite small and our room was on the tiny side but it was cute and comfortable and i would stay again i am not sure i can grade the hotel i never actually stayed in it they called me and said the boiler had broken down and could i transfer to a different hotel but then see the days the builder broken down there were other guests in the hotel perhaps they were laid shifting no positive nothing great location with   underground stations very close easy walking across hyde park to tourist attractions hotel staff friendly and very regal public areas in the hotel didn t have breakfast but heard it was good little welcome touches like fruit biscuits and bottled water and usual tea coffee etc waitrose garage close by if your looking for good value sandwiches etc   mins walk to paddington no negative i was very pleased with the service provided by your staff particularly luanne she was polite and professional and she allocated me a room suitable to my needs julion jueion my apologies if the spellings are incorrect he was very professional and arranged breakfast for me on   jan   very early the other staff members oleg nerijus and rita were very helpful thank you all see you soon the bathtub is too open then the bathroom was totally wet after shower the location is very good the bedroom is small but very clean and comfortable it wasn t an issue for me but there were some stairs down into the room as soon as you went through the door may not be suitable for those who have trouble with stairs so worth double checking when you book check in rooms are clean with modern bathrooms and the all important good shower the bar and lounge areas were really nice and had lots of character and felt comfortable actually making use of them as a solo traveller would return a very small room but more than adequate for one nights stay on business hotel is in a nice quiet london street location for the tube was superb and a street of restaurants just around the corner room had a comfy double bed with its own digital air conditioning and a recently refurbished bathroomno negative the staff was brilliant super friendly and very helpful quick to deliver on room service the communal rooms are amazing original character details with fireplaces and sofas a great space to have a drink or a bottle of wine the rooms are modern with everything you need and lots of personal touches from robes slippers to shaving kit toothbrushes in the bathroom all you need if you forgot to bring any of your toiletries our room looked across to other character buildings with views down to hyde park small room the charm of this beautiful traditional british hotel situated in a very good area gives to you the perfect vibe of london friendly staff very clean and comfortable bed will definitely come back the room we were given did not look anything like the rooms on the website it was a tiny shoe box with modern decor however is was clean and newly furnished and had everything you d need the hotel reception and lobby area is beautiful first room had no hot water they moved me but checked someone else in to the same room that person opened the door to my room and woke me up from my sleep about   mins a hotel employee came to ask me my name obviously they didn t have their communication down on the room switch also no restaurant open the bar food was terrible good price the room we were initially given was ridiculously small superior double room more like closet however upon complaining to the staff they did give us a different room the next day staff dealt with our room problem the next day without too much fuss we arrived at     check in at  pm and couldn t check in due to their system being down they offered us a free drink on the house when went to the bar there were another     ppl sipping their free drinks after having a very well needed glass of prosecco we changed at their wc and headed to town upon our return we were checked in in our deluxe room this room although was located on the first floor had its window near the ceiling it basically was a semi basement and we couldn t open windows either they were painted over so to get some fresh air we had to open the door otherwise the room was good shower is clean would stay there again but defo not on the  st floor the location is excellent there loads of cafe restaurants groceries waitrose sainsbury tesco around georguoes kensington hyde park is just across the road bus stops and underground all just a step away so all and all good value for money friendly staff the bathroom however luxurious gave off an unpleasant sewage smell it wasn t major but unpleasant anyhow the fridge in our particular room was very loud to the point where it woke us up in the night before being switched off the heating air con unit didn t seem to have any effect and needs upgrading the hotel itself is very grand traditional and looks fantastic the deluxe room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with great facilities the staff are friendly and dressed as grand as the hotel is the location is perfect for tourists being a   second walk from kensington gardens and a couple minutes away from the nearest tube no negative friendly helpful staff made us feel like we were vip we will be staying here again hopefully in march the original wooden decor and the ornate michaelangelo painted ceilings are a sight to behold really loved it food was excellent with plenty of choice the view from my room   was told it was a bigger room but not told i would get a bad view where i couldn t see out i loved the location but my room was in the basement so i had a bad view of the bins wish i had been told i wouod get a nicer view in a different room bathrooms were clean and showers hot which was awesome rooms are too small to the point of making a very uncomfortable stay the bar closes too early no space to have a drink or dinner even the bathrooms are so tiny bed comfy nice breakfast no negative i actually live round the corner from this hotel and booked it as a birthday surprise for my sister and her fiance as a romantic break and a great way for us to catch up easily the following day not only did i book it at a greatly discounted price but they were so lovely to upgrade the couple to the beautiful lilly langtry suite my sister adores   poster beds and the only way to describe the suite is as magnificent and they also provided complimentary wine chocolates and a fruit basket they let me know the next day that the bar staff were also truly phenomenal friendly service as well as front of house with opulent decor and great drink prices i book and stay in a lot of hotels as an event planner and most definitely will be recommending this one to everyone and making sure that i get to stay myself one day soon nothing the hotel had maintenance issues and they transported me to an other hotel with an upgraded room and complimentary breakfast the sister hotel was nice modern and very quiet excellent location breakfast was good the room was small and dirty the walls were dirty and the bed was made but the covers wernt changed on the second day even though they said they were changed but the same stain was in the same place on the bedding so it definitely was not changed the new towels were dirty so i had to go get them changed i wouldn t go back no positive room was quite small but if you re only sleeping there it s okay the location of this place is superb close to subway and hyde park the interior is very   s   s i love it rooms are a little small and in parts it does need some decorating renovation great place if you just want a convenient and cheap place for a night staff are excellent and very polite little complications to reach some of the rooms after elevator door i needed to pass few corridors and steps up or down however the staff offered the help to carry the laguagge excellent customer service the single room was too small i had a big suit case with me and i had absolutely no space to walk the location is great the down stairs bar is cosy no negative grand and historic hotel reasonable prices to stay in the most beautiful old building sitting rooms and bar were just beautiful friendly staff great location in central london quiet away from the hubbub but close to paddington notting hill and choice of two tubes a minute s walk away loved it bar staff and receptionists were very moody bordering on rude breakfast waitresses were however very friendly room size was farcical yes it was cheap but a  x   m room was certainly not advertised nor would it have been booked location and price were excellentno negative staff couldn t do enough the hotel felt like a home and the breakfast was superb the location was perfect and the stay was best value i have ever had rooms are pretty tiny if i was with a partner it would have been far too small cleaning was okay but sometimes things were missed bar was dead and no in room dining oh and tv s whilst large weren t hd nice staff lovely reception and comfy beds also brilliant location rooms are very small and don t look anything like the pictures portrayed on booking com reception gives the impression that you are in an old english building shame about the room really basement twin barely a twin tiny tiny bathroom in which everything got wet quite noisy slightly shabby probably due a bit of a lick of paint and not that clean when we got in there sadly great location and the foyer area was lovely   wifi service is very poor and you have to log in every time   they mixed up our breakfast order twice   placed us in the basement despite my request to be in upper foors it was very noisy   the room service was very poor they were using the towels to clean the washroom floors and the bed sheets were not changed despite having stains on it   this is the first hotel i experience in my life that they don t have a scale to weigh our luggage location and friendly staff while the room was moderately comfortable it was very small and lacked finesse the sheets didn t fit the bed the shower head did not appear to work properly and the bathroom door wouldn t close these were small inconveniences but for the cost of the room i would not have expected them the staff were friendly and helpful and the location made it very easy to travel around london the hotel staff made a mistake on the date of my heathrow shuttle booking which did not arrive on my check out date it was only after i waited for  mins and asked the hotel staff to call the shuttle company before they realized the mistake i had to make last minute alternative arrangements to heathrow airport and was nearly late for my flight hotel architecture has a traditional english heritage charm which makes my stay feel authentic yet has modern facilities to ensure a pleasant stay room is new and clean though small there s a welcome basket of fruits and chocolates in the room which are appreciated hotel is conveniently located from kensington garden queensway and bayswater underground broken thermastat smell from drains told we would have a superior double room but it was standard apparently in this hotel superior means standard bedding inadequate no window no ventilation one sealed window that was dirty very small room location room was terribly small and the bathroom was even smaller i think this is typical for most european hotels i am from the u s and accustomed to larger facilities but it was very small for two people also we were in the basement meaning we had a terrible view and the one window we did have was drafty and leaked in wind all night long causing the person sleeping nearest the window to freeze loved the location very close to two underground lines and hyde park unfriendly and unhelpful staff they did not have any information on various questions such as parking in the neighbourhood or where to watch the new year fireworks they actually advised us to go trafalgar square where it was not screened and not possible to watch comfortable rooms in a very nice building bathroom was a little small and the rooms were plain compared to the lobby other than that it was good just thought they didn t keep in tone of the hotel although we didn t encounter any problems or use the hotel facilities that much the check in service was prompt no negative the room had been recently renovated in a modern style we found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the victorian style of the public areas these were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings the one way street was residential with large well maintained victorian houses now mostly flats it was very quiet a range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a circle line underground station it was easy to travel to the theatre via the circle line we had booked room only so cannot comment on the food their room prices were a bit steep even that is fine but then it should include breakfast they didn t include the breakfast in the charge and it was   pounds per person which some might find expensive of one looks at the total amount spent the hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall the entire experience was great the staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us i loved that personal touch yes central london is very expensive and the rooms aren t big but it s central london and when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters the toilet even had a bath tub which was great a great experience and its just on the other side of the queensway station a   min walk and has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage totally worth it i recommend it strongly the size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it location of the hotel it s decoration and specially the staff were very good the cost of the smallest room we have ever had in london we asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member we believe that for in excess of   pounds for a   hour stay bottled water would be included the fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day the basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated the location was very good the shower didn t have a curtain strange design feature excellent bar very nice decor helpful staff great history to the building buffet was expensive but high quality very close to the underground tube asides breakfast no restaurant roomservice within the hotel so i have to make sure i eat before returning to the hotel or hold something to eat i liked the location it was in a nice quiet area yet central and close to the stations so getting around was easy the room was nice and cosy the other receptionist at   inverness could do with training in customer service and interpersonal skills the rooms are a bit small but they are clean and tasteful the main hotel was poor we stayed at   inverness place which was good the staff was excellent particularly the receptionist and porter the room was really small however we are in london and obviously the hotel cannot help this location was great very near to a tube station and close to hyde park nil location is awesome more restaurants nearby incldg indian and chinese very closeby to bayswater and queensway station a beautiful catholic church nearby nice ambience would love to be there again the rooms are not as nice as the lobby no restaurant bar and even the lobby had no place to sit it s either sit in your tiny room or leave the lobby was period fashionable the room was decidedly compact but in a good way fabulous decor in the public areas and excellent breakfast location very good for both tube queensway or bayswater and kemsington gardens the two steps stairs in my room it kind of annoying but it is okay bcz the whole hotel is awesome the the hotel is so uniqe i like how it looks like from the old movie in term decoration style yet it keeps it modern culture not all reception staff were friendly some did not even smile lovely breakfast in two beautiful rooms bedrooms are quite small but amenities all there nothing it was my  rd time there they celebrated my birthday with a really nice big room chocolates bath robes and slippers had a lot of parcels coming everyday they ensured it s put inside the room location is superb stuff are reallyyyyy helpful and friendly kettle and tv malfunctioned but staff dealt with the problems extremely quickly and efficiently we love this hotel for its atmosphere and friendliness we enjoyed a very good breakfast and service could not have been better bed was very comfortable and the pillows were unusually good which was much appreciated the evening night staff was rude when i asked about the the double booking fee confusion on arrival as it wasn t clear that i had to bring the same credit card as when i booked the hotel your staff made it difficult to understand what the problem was the system could be more flexible i thought the room small and unimpressive for the upgraded room selected and below the standard i expect of   star hotels the staff were helpful on the phone allowing my girlfriend access to the room before my arrival and payment for the room no negative the staff we re very welcoming friendly couldn t do enough the underground queensway was only a   min walk from the hotel definitely staying again as many guests said the room is quite small and the shower could have a longer glass partition to avoid flooding the bathroom the place has a very good location surrounded by many facilities and well communicated the breakfast if booked early is worth just one complain they could have natural orange juice during our stay the airconditioning was not funtioning property also there was no possibility to open any windows friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed and room hotel was clean and quiet small corridors and lifts smell of the mold amazing location very nice building in good area underground station nearby old but maintainted ok heating had two choices a too hot b off too cold the staff knew this and did not tell me i woke three times during the night to turn on and off the heat when i told them they said they knew and if i called they would have given me a portable electric heater rooms are too small locationno negative the building is stunning and the reception area and lounge were very fitting of the name checked in at about   o clock and our rooms were ready straight away despite usually having to wait until  pm no negative great friendly staff with welcoming atmosphere at a wonderful hotel upgraded our room because this was our honeymoon night so made even more extra special stayed in club room very compact bathroom is very small however good power in shower and very clean location first impressions as you walk in the seating arrangements and furniture in bar area breakfasts staff were extremely helpful also located close to two tube lines these give easy access into central london good for the price i paid however would not have been happy if i paid full price rooms very very small bed not very comfortable we were double charged for our rooms once we addressed this with staff they rectified and refunded us immediately fantastic location friendly staff very nice breakfast and good service clean lovely hotel did not like the stairs in the room which led to the bathroom and the room was very small good job we did not stay for any longer than   nights great location friendly staff comfortable bed very relaxed atmosphere in the bar the fact that we booked to stay in hyde park but got moved to paddington and was only told because we called to see if there were parking the staff were fantastic and the service was brilliant the hotel looked much fancier on the photos than in reality the hallways were very narrow and claustrophobic the drain in the shower didnt work even after we warned the cleaning lady i got a discount meaning   pounds for two nights but this meant a room with a view of the opposite wall the location was great near hyde park and at walkable distance from the center no bad experiences our room was in need of a bit of tlc to bring it right up to standard but very clean and tidy beautiful old building with lots of history attached to it along with very helpful friendly staff price but i did book it last minute and we all like to save a bit of money we actually got moved very last minute but it completely worked out for the better everyone was helpful and we got a bigger room extremely happy no negative shower screen very inadequate pointless in fact and bathroom was instantly flooded room marketed as deluxe double which frankly is ridiculous couldn t swing a cat it was clean however we could not turn on the air conditioner they said since it s winter time they don t provide winter time well i think people should have the option room was too small blanket was too small for two people the complimentary biscuits and hot chocolate you don t see a lot of those in hotelsno negative hotel location is excellent near two tube stations and kensington park staff were very friendly and helpful glad to see that they had a nice bar within the hotel for a nightcap staff didn t offer any attraction discounts or airport pick up but when we did ask they were attentive we asked for a room on higher floor via booking com but upon check in were given a ground floor immediately called and inquired on a top floor room staff brought our luggage upstairs and waited to see if we were pleased with the room location is on point and convenient to get around overcharged room bill on check out charged for breakfast on the day before we arrived over charged on quoted price for breakfast command of spoken english from front of house staff difficult to understand room accessed via steps just inside door location easy bus routes tube station room clean walkable to paddington hotel was selected because of the charming public lounge which turned out to be closed to guests because of a private party for the duration of our stay without access to the lounge the hotel was nothing out of the ordinary to justify its high price no positive we were on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel and our room looked over the rear of another building so no view as such but i expect the same can t be said for every room location was fantastic just a  minute walk from the national history v a and science museums and even close to the royal albert hall the rooms were very small specially if you travel with a baby the price was the cheapest i found in the area i wanted to stay but it didn t not met my expectations that after i saw my room and realizing that it was very small they gave me an upgrade for free room   was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at     and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about   staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good i am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile the room service cleaning etc was good the hotel was clean bar staff good drinks expensive whiskey and coke and barcardi and coke was     well it is london i suppose reception staff good the breakfast was a dissapointment the food was wonderful but the service we found poor on asking for tea the used teapot was refilled dishes were not removed everything about our stay was wonderful i had mentioned that it was my daughters birthday and there were wine and champagne in the room which had also been upgraded it really was a great experiance i arrived with a baby and the hotel gave me a room downstairs at the ground floor to get there i have to climb up and down the steps and the room was too tiny and small too small very good reception and welcome staff bit of confusion over final payment my son had to pay for his own gift i had already paid and had confirmation but same card was needed to check in and i was on holiday with no wifi lovely hotel clean great area the room was quite small even after being upgraded the hotel is beautiful and well looked after we even got updated as we turned up early and our room was not available no negative friendly and helpful staff always pleasant smiling and willing to help wherever possible breakfast was excellent good choice of food excellent place for visiting many areas of london o  arena and victoria theatre we were able to visit many other places on our visit was in a twin club room it had very little space to move around in and had a tiny bathroom a squeeze but manageable however perfectly good as a place to sleep good location clean room comfortable beds very close to queensway tube station within walking distance of museums v a natural history museum etc and into city centre     minutes with lots to see on the way overall a good hotel and location for the price i paid would stay there again i find the rooms very small and i m only     i couldn t make myself a hot drink as there was too much limescale floating around in the cup i like the location and ease for getting around london and the lovely entrance hall not being able to stay there and being put in a sister hotel further up the road the room of which was very small we had looked forward to staying at the grand royale itself however as compensation they did give us complimentary breakfast at the grand royale throughout our stay location and decor of grand royale rooms are really small as often in london anyways way to hot in the room good breakfast but is not worthy the extra fee find room is not so easy great place wonderful position close to tube station and park for morning run complimentary fruits at the desk checkin and checkout might take a while no negative lovely building and very good location i paid for a superior room but it was more like a standard will visit again though building has great character staff were helpful and accommodating such small room king size bed taking most of the space in the room the two of us could not move around at the same time and we are both small the large lounge room was always closed this was not as per the advertised facilities old world style location the bedroom was tiny and not big enough to swing a cat we asked to change but the rooms we looked at were very similar in size the staff were the best and breakfast was very nice the reception and the lounge areas are full of character and well maintained size of bathroom far too small and as we were on a festive break the hotel had no festive feel with reception area no christmas spirit our bedroom had no outlook whatsoever location suited us and staff were very helpful was on ground level inner courtyard couldn t get window to latch next morning one lift not working and the other one was being used for laundry good location good value i was moved on to another hotel further up the street on my first night having paid   per night no breakfast it was unpleasant i accepted free breakfast on my two morning stay they seemed sincere and apologetic bathroom in room   small and dated but ok considering it is a rustic full of character hotel it has a traditional old hotel feeling the breakfast was great in a lovely room the staff are great and the location is in a safe area easy bus and underground my arrival necessitated movement to a sister hotel due to a plumbing issue which was an inconvenience but well handled the staff couldn t do enough no negative lovely quaint old hotel beautiful leaded windows we had a  th floor double deluxe room rooms are small but well equipped and clean just around the corner from a busy high streer and tube on the central line would definitely go back room temp too warm for me breakfast choice v good but not quite hot enough but acceptable lack of parking rooms unfussy and uncluttered nice to have a bath beds comfortable overall hotel decor a big plus even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight the room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in close to queensway tube station i m not usually one to write reviews but i am that unhappy and feel i need to warn people about how awful it is upon arrival the foyer was impressive it s a very beautiful building with art on the ceilings but unfortunately the rooms were a very different story the duvet cover had a big yellow stain on it so we had to ask for a clean one but when we tried to call down to reception the buttons on the phone had been pushed in so we couldn t use it and we didn t even get an apology there were dirty marks all up the walls and curtains we ordered an english breakfast with tea but the tea never arrived the gap between the wall and one side of the bed was about  ft so no space to move our view was of other rooms at     we were packing to leave when a member of staff just barged in despite check out being at   not happy at all with this hotel especially as we paid a lot of money we would not stay here again the bed was comfy and the location was nice as there was easy access to hyde park reception staff on arrival allocated us a room which was already occupied bathroom very small i m not sure why this room was a superior double hotel very convenient for all london attractions and underground links really small rooms and bathroom breakfast is expensive and not worth it the coffee pace around the corner had better and cheaper breakfast staff was unfriendly at check in but became better during our stay the beds were good and the location is excellent on arrival we were advised without any apology that we would be moving hotels because they had booking issues we planned our trip around staying in that location and specifically wanted a traditional hotel not a modern one with dirty restaurant that we got moved to my wife was was pregnant and we did not want to be shuttled around hotels on what was meant to be a special weekend away we have not received a word of apology from the hotel after our visit no positive on arrival we were advised the hotel staff had organised alternative accommodation due to a plumbing issue with our room our alternative accommodation did not have a double room they only a twin room available the hotel provided transport to our new accommodation horrific i stay in london every week in   or   star hotels this isn t a   star in my opinion dirty dated and grubby shame for such a beautiful building not much the room was tiny and shabby marks on the walls and dated decor very dusty also water not replaced for second night of stay very expensive with breakfast not even included internet kept dropping constantly with need to keep entering password the lobby and bar area were charming there was an offer by the hotel on booking com when i chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date thinking i was wrong i repeated the process but again the same result so i ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date i called the hotel but they told me that i have to call booking com i called booking com but they told me i have to call the hotel what a trap no positive the double room was incredibly small so would upgrade to club next time lack of choice for room service was perfectly situated for all our needs for this trip great staff very clean room too small we booked superior room and got noisy club room next to lift   smallest room i have ever stayed in quite clostraphobic the advert said we were getting   discount did complain but to no avail there to felt i had been hoodwinked john stokes location woken up by banging and drilling from work being done next door when the lady came to clean our room she left a big bag of rubbish in our room that wasn t ours on the morning of check out house keeping wanted to clean our room at    am check out not till  noon comfortable bed location the lifts were out of order at times the staff were pleasant but did not appear friendly location and the room was small but reasonably comfortable for a short stay very few staff members spoke english as their first language which made expressing our needs very difficult the night manager was argumentative rude and unhelpful hot water location and beautiful entryway our room was tiny the bathroom door opened into our bed it was that small we could hear everything from the room above television talking and banging didn t sleep at all it was for our  th wedding anniversary so very disappointed location the shower could of done with a bigger shower screen to prevent the bathroom floor getting drenched the bed was so comfy had the best night s sleep that we had to change to another hotel and it was a lot less luxurious then the hotel that i chose and paid for the room was extremely small and there was nothing in our mini bar the breakfast was not good the staff was really friendly and nice but we had to change hotel room bathroom were extremely small only a very small   door wardrobe no shower screen or curtain in the bathroom the whole bathroom will be wet during shower there were no space to put your luggages not to mention to move around in the room staff were friendly helpful room extremely small no bathrobe provided although on request staff so polite happy helpful location superb breakfast very good great value for money in central london smell of drains was overwhelming at times i would hope it was unique to my room and not a common theme great location with tubes and buses at a few steps from the hotel tiny room but had everything lift only to floor   and the a flight of stairs to floor   where the room was located no view from room as it was just me a real single room was ok and therefore good value the room had all necessary facilities and modern bathroom no negative my wife and i wanted a mini moon in london beautiful hotel the langtry suite is gorgeous friendly professional and accommodating staff the manager arranged for us to have a bottle of champagne and basket of fruit waiting of course the location could not be more central we had a wonderful time no negative unfortunately we were booked out to another hotel it didn t have the same eye catching detail of the grand royale it was my partners  th birthday treat and she was so disappointed the staff in the other hotel were very pleasant i paid extra for the breakfast couldn t get in to eat dinning room full couldn t accommodate a table for   wanted us to sit   at one table   at another the location rooms little small if you open your suitcase you will have to step over it to get to door or bathroom rooms slightly on small side but amazing value and location excellent and right on the park super clean well maintained rooms and bathrooms sadly for the price it costs its just not worth the money the deluxe room is tiny and this was an upgrade dread to think what we would have got if we hadn t not clean enough and looking tired which you wouldn t expect from somewhere of this price range and star good location   mins from queensway tube very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move the room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy it felt a like living in a basement furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps if your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it at that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already nice location next to tube stations and hyde park beautiful interior at the reception and breakfast area unfortunately the lobby was closed for a private event throughout our whole stay nice breakfast with a good variety of food room to small for a double it did not feel like a deluxe room difficult to communicate with some of the staff the breakfast room facilities hotel location nothing breakfast so much to choose from every taste catered for nothing too much trouble for the staff i asked for a fried egg for my husband and minutes later along came two the bedroom did not match the description on the website it was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was actually difficult to move in there we also paid extra for a club room but this just seemed to mean a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine were left in the room it was not the luxurious pampering advertised the location downstairs was beautifully decorated and the theatre bar was lovely very noisy outside in the night and early morning our room was at the back of the hotel and there were workmen outside early on saturday and sunday morning from    amno positive everything i have never stayed in a worse hotel room to small very dirty not to mention chipped glass and carpet no isinglass a trip hazard i would rate this hotel a   star not a five star i feel cheated of my money the mixed gender toilets within the hotel were very cramped upon arrival other than that i could not fault the hotel location was ideal for our visit to winter wonderland no negative staff very friendly good location right beside hyde park and one minute walk from queensway tube station on the central line very clean rooms just a bit small windows couls not be opened the double bed a bit on the small side for our purpose the location was perfect everything was fine as usual for london the rooms are small this is as a rule compensated by generous lobbies and lounges which really makes sense as you only sleep in your room the bathroom was modern good design and clean very small room the room was so cold central heating doesn t work from  am  pm hotel policy they did get me a heater though felt that towels and linen weren t so clean good location nearby parks and   minute walk to tube lots of stores and cafes around open late no negative nothing how on earth can this hotel be rated as a   star if it was not for this false rating i would never have booked this abysmal place small rooms small bathrooms smashed bugs on the walls holes in the wall whole above window stuffed with paper towels poor housekeeping close to the underground helpful staff in reception the rooms on the ground floor are very cold because of huge old windows the noice isolation is very bad very noisy the rooms are very small the location is very good the staff is very helpful and wellcomed rooms are very small related to the amount paid it is too expensive comparing with   stars hotels i paid over   pound night that a very high cost for this tiny room food and beverage are expensive they offer me to pay   pound for breakfast and i didn t not get it of course i am not in four seasons hotel so it is my only complain that the cost is too high related to what i get room size and food location is amazing as it is easy to go anywhere from there loved the stuff they are so kind and helpful close to restaurants and coffee shops juts take care in shopping as other areas you can get better deals the adequacy of the room size appears to be pot luck the room i was in for the second period of my stay was much better than the first see my other review following the first period of my stay helpful staff good location all the little stairs before you get to the room the shower door was very small no room to put your toiletries no room to hang the towel by the basin the walls were too thin i could hear my neighbor snoring the room service was only cold sandwiches no positive had only one night would have liked to try the bar but it closed early didn t have breakfast included in room rate that the location is very central   minutes walk from queensbury tube station yet quiet gorgeous quintessentially english facade and common areas makes you feel going back in time nice staff nothing a problem given free room upgrade to club room which was adequately spacious and had view of hyde park free wifi and tea coffee biscuits in room the room we stayed in was a bit small and the   steps up into it were a bit unexpected the shower could do with a bit bigger shower screen curtain as the loo and floor got soaked while in it the hotel is exactly as it is in the photos its a truly fabulous place and wouldn t think twice of not going there again rooms were to small good location next to restaurants and travel links clean hotel friendly staff gave us a complimentary extended check out would stay again the temperature of the room and no air con the bathroom was very small with a sliding door and was very close to the first bed the shower would drench the whole bathroom floor complimentary gifts and the old interior unfortunately there is nothing grand or royal about this hotel i had room   the floor creaked the ceiling creaked as people in the room above me moved around the room was not clean old grubby fingermarks on both sides of the bathroom door weeks of dirt on the washbasin lamps corners of the bathroom hadn t been cleaned housekeeping woke me up and walked in at    am then back again at    am even though checkout is specified as     noon i had an upgraded room to superior and it was tiny  cms between the bed and the wall window god knows how small a standard deluxe room is the only positive thing about this hotel is its location it is near the tube station and queensway hyde park not royal not grand the rooms are very small like prison cell not enough space for luggage maintenance very bad location good nothing else arriving after a   hs flight and being told my room was sold to sb else and no longer available even having my credit card as a guarantee after   minutes i got another room for extra price after complainig some more the extra charges were removed from my bill but this procedure is unacceptable front desk and reservation department needs plenty of training in good manners and hotel service the location is great safe close to the park and the tube dreadfully noisy woken up very early sunday morning by people servicing building adjacent don t stay on this side of hotel nice bar area and friendly enough staff small room but clean and tidy the superior room wasn t it was adequate but compact lack of restaurant the hotel and room were clean and comfortable very close to underground stations when i booked the room through booking com i thought i was going to have the superior room on arrival i was given the club room box the shower was so tight i was not able to turn round it was that tight the wardrobe was in the worst place by the door which was not helpful on entering the room i thought the cost of the room was expensive as it was not the room i had booked with booking com i liked the hotel the staff were very nice and nothing was to much if we had a different room i m sure we would of have had a much better time in the hotel the staff who dealt with the initial arrival and stringent way they dealt with the hotel policy when they had no authority for specific information the misinformation the staff gave in relation to credit card provider and details of the credit card being passed to their finance dept when not authorised no positive the room was really quite small but for   per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location there was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc and the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until i covered it with a towel also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in there was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time the building was beautiful full of character it was clean and current room just too small particularly if you have any luggage and who doesn t this hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt the staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it the problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other one had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room if you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room also in staying   days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied the bathrooms were a tad small i had a bathtub my friend had a shower and the one with the shower was tiny breakfast was good but expensive the hotel is really beautiful inside it has an elevator not always the case in london and the staff are fantastic the beds are quite comfortable and it is in a great location do not stay here i had a single room i didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom ac only sent out hot air even though it was set at   degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night a really uncomfortable experience i got about   hours sleep nothing rooms were small we had a club room which had only a double bed with very little space around it there was a curious little area by the windows with a desk which had no heating though you could close it off with a curtain bathroom was very small with a tiny washbasin and shower no bath a two minute walk from the queensway tube station gorgeous building particularly the bar a former theatre and the dining room breakfast was good too i thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking the room didn t smell very clean i asked to be moved the hotel is in a good location however i have stayed at much better hotels more centrally located against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best  sq m as a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long a final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there overall this is a nice hotel with some plusses a beautifual old style entrance hall and bar and equivalent large rooms for breakfast the staff is efficient and very courteous the breakfast buffet is quite reach did not have a bad experience at all the only recommendation would be to have a larger shower centrally located to where we wanted to go plus subway close by great area to walk and dine loved everything its quaintness and staff were very dear and lovely staff very noisy in the morning cleaning a room opposite when we were sleeping well trying to good location close to albert hall which was where we were going for a concert however not very close very ornate and historical the room was ridiculously hot even with the air con on   degrees and the fan on full the pillows are very uncomfortable the room looks clean until you look at the skirting s or ledges the staff were all friendly and accommodating the bedding is very clean and the bathroom is well equipped if a little small the breakfast is excellentno negative absolutely gorgeous hotel the interior was amazing the rooms lovely as well small but everything you need lovely hand written welcome message will definitely be back the location could not have been more perfect for us our favourite london hotel so far parking was advertised to me that indicates parking on hand and easy and part of the hotel property under their control was only parking on street or at very expensive private car park found space after   minutes great bed bathroom bit on tight side but good and modern room was as big as a shoe there wasn t even enough room to open the little foldable rack that you lay your suitcase on although there was one in the room interesting atmosphere in lobby the rooms were incredibly small it was difficult for two people to sleep on a double bed we literally had to hop around the room there isn t even any space to open your bag i know rooms in london and specially in zone   are small i have lived in other hotels in central london as well but the room here were a big disappointment the location was very nice   stops on tube from oxford circus and  mins walk from queensway and bayswater tube station the hotel is located in a victorian building the room was to small one could not pass between the bed and the window on one of my   day stay the room and bath have not been cleaned we found it in the evening as we had left it in the morning very good breakfast very nice staff good location no negative the location was perfect close to two tube lines that easily put us in different parts of the city the hotel was clean our room was quiet and the staff was friendly and personable lobby is crowded and needs to be cleaned plus they need to put clocks in the room the front desk staff was exceptional the nigh shift staff was cherry and helpful a nice bunch i was checked in by gina who professional courteous and very knowledgable all in all an excellent experience bar shuts early no ironing service rooms are tiny so so small we had a club room supposedly bigger you couldn t open the wardrobe and exit the room or enter the bathroom over space then bathroom my guess  m  good breakfast but an extra not included the fruit was a nice add to but should have been checked before we went into the room because the banana left was rancid great location most of the staff were lovely it was lovely to have fruit on arrival in the room see other comment sheeets had spots it was all very dusty and the room was very tiny the girl at the reception was really rude the room was not serviced in the morning and when i returned to the hotel at   pm i found it as i had left in the morning the position was very good there was a kettle in the room the only little complaint i have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often mine was sticky the rest of the room was very clean though the bar is stunning actually the whole hotel is beautiful we were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked the room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening good location and staff were delightful though ultimately unhelpful suggesting it would have been better if we had booked direct with them despite booking this hotel in january we were given rooms at top of hotel classed as superior rooms they were more like attic rooms you could not walk around the small double bed however we were given complimentary breakfast no positive bar closes too early in the evenings bar decor was a bit shabby and tired single room although comfortable i felt in an exposed and remote situation at the back of the hotel the double lock on the door did not work and the safety chain could easily be broken if door forced no positive the noise on top our room was below the conference and they did not move us when they had an event they were moving the furnitures and fixing the mir conference room till  am and we had hardly any sleep we kept on complaining but they only stopped early morning and started early the cleanliness of the place and accessibility no negative location close to queensway tube station and bus stop for buses to the west end opposite kensington gardens hyde park and very convenient for royal albert hall v a natural history museum theatre bar public areas very good room clean and good bathroom fitments that were very easy to use bedroom was very small and cramped with one side of double bed against a wall and not much space on other side for anything other than walking to bathroom small desk at base of bed but not enough space to sit at the desk i was traveling alone so just needed somewhere to sleep good location with easy access to central london friendly and helpful staff the room was really small and there are lots of stairs even within the room the building is very nice with antique details breakfast is really good really close to the underground station we were given a room that was as the last person left it ie towels everywhere and used bed etc etc reception apologised and moved us immediately tube pretty much around the corner friendly staff and the breakfast was really good also all the royal parks in easy walking distance the shower is very small and my wakeup call was   minutes late my day of departure the room was very quiet cleaned promptly daily tea and biscuits replenished daily and staff very helpful certain staff were not knowledgeable and did not provide reliable assistance great location right near   major underground lines rooms were small but manageable hotel took extra payment from credit card which wasn t refunded until arrival despite phone calls breakfast not included in price very unusual these days english fluency not brilliant impressive reception rooms and breakfast room good choice of breakfast comfortable bed small room but it is london great location close to   underground stations nice sandwich shop around the corner for a light breakfast close to grocery shopping and dining bar in hotel the staff is not polite and cannot even take the pain of answering to a good morning the rooms are ridiculously small and dirty the bathroom is simply a joke  m this hotel is not worth even   star close to the central line we arrived at royale hotel at hyde park where they took my payment for the room it was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in paddington they paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in   mins however we were made to wait   mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be the hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable the hotel we ended up staying in was actually very nice even though it was in a different location to where we had booked it our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the tv didn t have good reception we thought the hotel was lovely and the staff were helpful and friendly i had a ground floor room the view was of a brick wall and at times you could hear the tube arriving departing although it didnt disturb my sleep the rooms are very small the hotel staff are really friendly the hotel is very handy for the tube station and is close to a number of shops and restaurants within walking distance upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after   minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted she told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked we did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small when entering the room i immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls my partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat i turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so i ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust after informing the front desk and upon return to our room i was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned i decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath i had to annoyingly fiddle with it then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until i forced it to pull back out on my first night i had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out i proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided after i finished writing i turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration we looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at however we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed my partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish entrance hall was beautiful i know it was in a deal but the room was very small it was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves location to hyde park and tube stations was superb do not order room service we ordered two panini s in the evening one cheese chicken and the other cheese pepperoni this was to come with a side salad and crisps this was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy however when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side it looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived i took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look i said i have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh i dont know how a panini should look i dont eat them this wasnt really the response i was hoping for so just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed no positive room was a bit small and breakfast was a little pricey but still within comfortable standards beautiful property with a great history location couldn t be better very close to hyde and kensington park staff was helpful and prompt with request breakfast room was stunning it was close to two tube stations so it was very accessible for travel i would definitely stay there again no negative i really enjoyed my stay at the hotel the staff were really helpful professionally and friendly the room was beautiful clean and comfortable the breakfast was great i will be recommending this hotel to my friends no negative the excellent staff especially aijaz and rita they were very helpful and and gave great suggestions generally a very pleasant stay would highly recommend clean modern bathroom but very cramped great location very friendly and efficient staff and lovely and clean interesting history of this hotel with pictures and write ups in the reception we were moved from grand royale to shaftesbury international up the road i agreed because i was told the replacement was the same standard it wasn t we were upgraded to a club room which was tiny hair on floor in bathroom and hair in towels specks of dirt in bed some sort of ironing residue the hotel was next door to some sort of hostel with a rowdy group of drinking buddies outside staff were pleasant and helpful maybe i haven t got my head around london pricing yet but i couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast we did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel staff were superb we didn t meet a bad person all week lots of choice for breakfast the room was more than adequate for our needs if i m a bit picky a spruce up with a paint brush wouldn t have gone a miss and we loved the building the location was spot on for us too and would like to stay at this hotel for all of our london visits in the years to come thank you deluxe double room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed   time on several occasions i saw the front desk staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation i was promised an upgrade to a club room after   night but the front desk never followed up on this yes the lobby and formal drawing room are quite stunning as is the theatre but it all stops there nothing negative to say but if i was forced to give something it would be that the pillows are hard and uncomfortable the building and interior decor is beautiful and in keeping with its history the room size is terrible small for us from asia to london cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage no space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than japan room i think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for   days   nites short stay with one small bag the location great for jogger that can jog at the park or different stations to different locations this is why l like this hotel one lady i think assistant manager or manager i like her she is helpful and great the bellboy group also helpful too share more than you ask that kind of answer you will receive request thing fast to deliver to us one small thing that could be improved is the glass shower screen on the bath shower was not big enough good price and convenient location for the tube the hotel is next to hyde park so a nice walk through the park to either oxford street or harrods etc difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops excellent location comfortable room enjoyable breakfast decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less the reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs it is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel apart from the great staff great bathroom very good breakfast and great location just   mins walk to hyde park lancaster gate tube station and a few nice pubs a little expensive for the average traveller we were last minute booking or would have chosen elsewhere in the area they tried to bill us for breakfast we didn t have and very disorganized on check out close to tube station and kensington park no negative the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms were clean the beds comfortable and the bathroom large for a london hotel close to multiple tube stations great location will be staying here again room was substandard for price and did not have fore poster bed nor queen size beds as per advert and confirmed by reception breakfast was wrong on both mornings bar closed at  am no dining in the evening the decor of the hotels reception area and bar were very nice we were in room   very noisy from  am doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging we had asked for a quiet room also a small point re the wardrobe hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out beautiful building staff very welcoming professional pricing of a single person    x  m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable i don t know how the picture of the bed was made it must have been made before they built the walls around the room could not have been more than   cm between bed and wall on one side only had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room lively neighborhood access to underground close to hydepark for a run very pleasant hard working and well trained staff alert security service to keep a watch on a drunk guest classic grand hotel surroundings i booked a double room for   person but when i reached on that day they gave us   single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room no positive every thing expansive room is dark no refrigerator the bathroom door is very old and locked us inside many times my mistake is i paid for my whole stay in advance location the room was very warm and we had to prop a window open to get fresh air the mattress was probably past its use by date the shower screen was not wide enough for us to stop water going onto the floor the hotel is conveniently located a one minute walk from the station but far enough away from the main road to ensure no noise at night being opposite hyde park was also an advantage there are plenty of services located nearby shops restaurants atms we wanted olde english d cor and we got it nothing the hotel has a fantastic central location close to hyde park very close to paddington station enabling easy access to heathrow express heathrow airport as well as st pancras station for eurostar to paris loved the historic building elegantly furnished and decorated very friendly and helpful staff was the icing on the cake we were delighted to be offered an upgrade to a club room would definitely stay here again as with many big cities rooms and bathrooms are quite small even in the club rooms great location with easy access to queensway and bayswater tube stations and about   minutes walk from paddington station airport express good eateries in westbourne grove and good chinese eateries in queensway edwardian dark oak panelling through public rooms is impressive the room was too small with very cerky floor poor sound proof low ceiling and very dirty window the location is very good nearby   metro station and the hyde park is just across the street room was a bit claustrophobic often seen in older uk properties would appreciate a second chair so that both residents could sit simultaneously we selected the location for easy access to amenities transportation etc but the elegance of the property made us look forward to returning home at the end of a hectic day not quite walking distance to paddington room was small and oddly configured with about   stairs from the door to the room breakfast was expensive coffee better around the corner good location near queensway and the park and paddington grand and impressive pleasant to stay in nice bar the room was tiny i have never stayed in a room so small ever the quilt was not big enough to cover both of us the bathroom is tiny and down a set of stairs no where to put anything because the room is so small the entrance is amazing staff were friendly although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window if this was the upgrade i dread to think what our original room would have been like for a   star hotel and the amount we paid i would not have expected any of these things location was good and room was clean and bed comfortableno negative the hotel is well situated to get around the city i travelled alone and had a single room which was just fine for me comfortable and clean a nice bar as well we had to climb a narrow staircase and walk along very narrow corridors to our room the room was too small for its description as a superior double if we had not benefited from a big room rate discount we should have been very dissatisfied check in was efficient the room was clean tidy and well equipped location near kensington gardens bus routes and two tube stations was very good the rooms are a bit worn down and showing their age for the price and location its still a good deal location to hyde park and underground breakfast is great bed very uncomfortable on last night for some strange reason fine for rest of stay spoilt the overall impression lots of places to eat nearby quite central and not too noisy the staff is friendly but not well organised they kept us waiting in front of them in the lobby for almost   hours for our room over the announced checkin time the hotel is very close to   different metro lines and thus you can easily get anywhere in london also the hotel is very nicely maintained and the lobby with its old sofas and wooden walls is simply beautiful simple things the duvet was far too small for the bed the coffee and sugar were not replenished when asked when having a shower the screen was so small that water went all over the floor cold iced water when requested nothing was too much trouble perfect location room very very small i booked a double and it felt claustrophobic for   glad there wasnt   of us no restaurant and room service menu limited room needed redecorating and as an older female i would have appreciated a little help with my luggage up and down front steps no porter and reception ignored me i am a regular visitor to london and usually stay     star and i just feel grand royal could do better location the room was very small and was quite stifling with no opening windows or room air conditioning ok for   night great location for us as we were attending the radio   concert in hyde park lovely building and very clean with welcoming polite staff i choose a club room which i paid a little more for however although it had everything you would expect it was quite small with a window only   foot wide i absolutely loved the original features within the hotel the corn icing the wood panelling the oringal windows absolutely wonderful the bar on the second floor where lillie langtree aparently entertained guest is quirky and charming comfortable beds just around the corner from a tube station and opposite hyde park nothing really room was really small but had everything required so we would stay there again excellent location friendly and helpful staff stored our luggage after check out clean and comfortable room very convenient for several buses and it was lovely to just cross the road and be in kensington gardens we didn t try breakfast at the hotel as   seemed far too expensive quiet hotel lovely area close to pubs supermarkets and two tube stations metres away from the lovely hyde park everything the rooms are small and cramped the staff are just there not welcoming or even happy looking they freeze money in your account you at the bill on arrival and the don t free i your monet until about three days after your stay disgusting nothing we requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one few of the staff members were really helpful specially one aijaz divecha the only thing we didn t like is one of the managers on duty during the day showed very little concern for the customer awful to have to deal with fortunately the rest of the staff made up for him location awesome beautiful building the checking in and checking out processes are very slow with staff not taking any notice of people arriving serving people in the wrong order is just annoying first come first served should be respected not enough of a problem to be negative but be prepared to be assertive good location for hyde park queensway tube station is just around the corner pleasant and traditional hotel with wooden panelled reception and large lounge yet modern rooms and good facilities for a one night stay room was tiny like a renovated closet yet everything was there as it was obviously well planned out quaint little hotel everything was clean and comfortable staff very helpful ideal area from which to walk to most places air conditioning was good best wifi i have experienced in years  mg at least room could be bigger but i can t complain given its ideal location in london we were moved from the hotel to a sister hotel shaftesbury hotel the shower is amazing even though the bathroom is quite small not surprising given the hotel is in london the staff was great to accommodate us that rhe hotel did not have a dinner service or any out of hours room service if you felt hungry this is poor as where the hotel is based you can not buy any food after  pm clean room friendly staff the room was very small although we got upgraded into a bigger room but still it was small the cleanses was poor the location and the staff very friendly and helpful rooms were small but this is reflected in the price so not bad value for money public areas were nice good location close to two tube stations and hyde park quite a few restaurants and shops nearby room was quit small check in was slow and complicated some lack of information and misunderstanding of booking and payment difficult to catch with email excellent location nothing the breakfast is really good a complete and nice english breakfast the staff are really friendly i could mention several but now i remember only the friendliness of francesca and gina small room ground floor front room closed for a private party almost each night but the bar in the back room was open good location nice street front and ground floor interior extremely small rooms had a club room which was very small staff were wonderful and put me in s different club room with more space and a better view surprised that it is a   star hotel good location nice decor helpful staff tiny room have constantly to sign into wifi staff was rude in the beginning but became nicer and the sheets were not changed on our second day nice lobby good location to the park rooms too small hardly any space to put your luggage especially if you take a single room good location friendly staff and let me an early check in when i arrived early arrived to find there were boiler problems they tried to palm us off with another hotel which was inferior and had a walk up price   cheaper than what i had paid we have experienced this excuse multiple times in london so stood our ground another room was conveniently found for us after not accepting their offer no positive nothing really i liked the name of your hotel i liked the look of your hotel i liked eating breakfast in your hotel i liked all of your staff the quality of service care we received during our   night stay in your hotel your hotel was grand enough for this aussie princess her bloke rooms are tiny the location was perfect and very convenient to queensway tube stop the staff were very friendly and helpful beautiful decor in main areas the room was clean and well maintained during my stay the bed was really comfortable my reservation was for two bed it was not available when we checked in it became available   days later your front desk did a fantastic job that we decided to stay and i am glad we did front desk service special thanks to ms enrika very friendly no negative the location was perfect for access to the notting hill carnival the bed was really comfortable despite the cosy room size the staff were very friendly and helpful lack of variety on the room service menu problems with key cards the staff were wonderful and very attentive beautiful decor and excellent location staff did not acknowledge you when coming and going rooms very small cannot move around furniture bathroom was the size of a closet location decor in main areas my room was really small and had a large twin sized bed didn t really have a restaurant breakfast only but that wasn t a problem as i found restaurants in the area to eat in i liked the atmosphere the staff were very helpful to a first timer in london me the room was clean and well maintained during my stay the room is not practical difficult to open the window stairs after the door to get in the room loss of space no cover on the bath so the water gets all around the bathroom hairdryer attached to drawer but not enough space to sit down on the chair am i supposed to steel the hairdryer there were small flies it was a clean room overall except from the small flies i would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay we were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option everything basically the room was great the bed was comfortable the location was great and the staff we very welcoming and we particularly liked the happy hour in the theatre bar fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience the location and decor upon arrival we had to wait   minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our   suitcases up the stairs into the reception area we had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of   people one of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other we asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it we had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets we found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair we accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet they gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room when we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday my card was overcharged by   when i had checked out when i rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank when i called my bank they had given me   preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra   from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it the manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank they are highly unprofessional and i will never ever stay at this hotel again it is appauling and disgusting after explaining to the manager all of the terrible things we experienced at this hotel we were given complimentary breakfast for bothh days and   refund although i believe our whole stay should ve been refunded size of the club room we were in very small luckily we travelled light nice hotel with mostly friendly staff great location with fantastic access to hyde park and queensway tube   minutes walk away very small room quite a challenge with two suitcases we were transferred to their sister hotel the shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel we were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out we were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely the hotel is very close to both bayswater and queensway tube stations and to hyde park lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms i guess they must have been looking for something they lost not much very small and by the way they gave me a club room i cannot imagine the sizes of the other rooms not very clean no room service wifi is zaft always disconnect expensive the view of room is horrible location  am smoke alarm causing everyone to attend the main foyer for an hour on thursday       also relatively small rooms and dining room staunch ions need removal friendly service good breakfasts close to public transport and parks cleanliness of rooms is challenging there was a bit of misunderstanding regarding on room upgrade but they managed it quickly perfect location beautiful building great staff extremely good service i loved every moment well done thank you for a wonderful weekend ioannis batsos the service was exselent breakfast exselant staff exselant roomservice exselant overall to be honest far better then the hilton iv satayed at before and it was fantastic value for money and the location exselant i am defenitly recomending the hotel to my friends and colligues and fammily thank you for a weekend of perfection couldnt have asked more many thanks to all the fantastic staff who were exselant ioannis batsos reception staff poor upon arrival   staff behind reception seemingly dealing with   unhappy guest whilst we stood there finally someone came to check us in he demanded full payment straight away which is fine then told us our room was not ready this was  pm check in is  pm not a good start location was excellent clean room the rooms are very small i booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one i had there was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed the fire alarm went off at  am not the hotel s fault but the following night i was kept awake by faulty door chimes which i couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club the fire alarms seem to work staff are pleasant and professional building full of character the wifi kept clicking off and there was only one shower gel but over all amazing the bathroom bed the kind staff and breakfast plus the hotel amazing the fire alarm went off at  am it was chaos no one knew what to do proper legal protocol was not followed poor communication from the staff and not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning it spoilt out overnight stay the hotel could be fabulous just staff and decor in some rooms let it down the hotel in the main is stunning but the rooms need sorting we had a hole in the wall and it desperately needs fixing up my mum and stepdaughter got lots of complimentary things chocolates drinks etc we didn t my room was smelly and small hence beds are small for couples no space in the room to store my luggage the lady in the reception showed me other rooms which still small and we have to pay extra money for no value the location is near to shops subway and hyde park staff are excellent and helpful room was extremely small despite being located on the first floor you feel like in the basement small unopenable window half bricked up you have to climb up the stairs to the bed the bathroom you cannot turn around poor working wifi friendly staff good location room was clean moved to another hotel at the eleventh hour situated on the ground floor of an annex next to the front door and lift i booked above ground had to cross a road to go to breakfast the staff were lovely room was small and the small window did not make the room very light staff were friendly and professional very clean lovely breakfast which was well worth the money no facecloths a must for me bath was too high to comfortably access shower for someone my age   no dining room music a bit dismal staff were excellent room very comfortable but a bit colourless lounge is gorgeous as is theatre bar we didn t have a bad experience hotel in a lovely quiet area   tube stations right around the corner with access straight to city centre in   mins had a lively time and would definitely return the room was on the small side and the electronic maid service alarm kept buzzing in the night and at times in the morning the building was beautiful and very impressive windows didn t open we had to wait for our room although were offered a room on the lower ground floor instead although small the rooms were designed around making the most of the space good selection at breakfast i have updated my room to luxury room on booking website but i didn t got it and the breakfast was included and also they said you have to pay another     each for breakfast that s not fair i got the deal on booking com and when you arrive giving you different things and different deal i liked the location was so close to the station room was clean bathroom was clean the size of the room was very or should i say extremely small hardly can move or have place to keep our laguge the staff were very friendly and helpful loved the location and very quite wifi was good although there is a main elevator climbing up and down side stairs a bother with bags lovely old style hotel very retro british lobby and exterior room was renovated and shower room new and functional bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small very friendly helpful staff ground floor kept in it s original style good value breakfast deluxe double was a very small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on  th floor so when i was in shower i nearly hit my head on ceiling and i m only   foot   there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however i would rate this a   star lovely ornate lobby perfect safe location   block from underground the facade of building is what makes the building read my comment above rooms are too small from what updated in the online same like prison room entry disappointed with the service from morning desk as they are claiming the picture advertised is not under thier responsibility they don t give me option to cancel the booking at all i need to pay more pounds to upgrade the room but that room also with unreasonably limited space with higher paying rate only satisfied with the service of night shift manager and team aijaz aurel charlie unable to take a shower without soaking the tiny bathroom lovely location comfortable room we had a club room which was okay in size the smaller rooms would have been very compact bar closes early for a saturday room was very small and although it was on  st floor wasn t possible to open window maids are very noisy in the morning location our room was hidden away in the basement but then it was one of the cheaper rooms the lobby and communal rooms are beautiful and provide a fantastic environment to chill out in the  st night was terrible we were arranged to a single room in the basement where our luggages couldn t be opened because of the limited spaces when we opened our room you need to walk up the stairs really terrible but we paid over   dollars hong kong very unhappy and disappointed we complained and the manager upgraded us to club room which was acceptable for the rest of my stay no positive at first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable good location in a safe residential area the hotel offered subtle bus to heathrow airport which helped me a lot because i traveled alone and was carrying a big luggage duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image quite disappointing bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one really need to look into that staff n location great rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic the style of hotel and location was fantastic the room was just far too small to justify the price tag not enough room for one let alone two suitcases the bathroom was more like a broom closet breakfast was good no open windows open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps also does not overlook hyde park as advertised clean bathroom and towels at all timescale the rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid i got the best value good job grand royal hotel location customer service breakfast was served in very best room what ever i asked they were more then happy to help on check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue the chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when i said we will cancel and i would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay this ruined our start to our stay marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom carpet small bedroom also great location fantastic breakfast of very high quality foods theatre bar and original features are impressive very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny i guess its because of the location which was excellent very good location and also nice common rooms for the third time i was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group the other hotel had a lift out of order the tv worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot i am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel i booked and i am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list what was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in i chose this because of location and i liked it despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking i asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details a double superior room was booked and on arrival we where upgraded to club small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned really nice location in the centre the staff was really helpfull and polite the rooms were clean the bedroom was small in spite of being told we were getting an upgrade it makes me wonder what the downgrade was like the bed itself was uncomfortable the desk staff were very helpful towels were rough elegant hotel a block away from banks two subway stations one stop from paddington train station and near restaurants nicely decorated rooms and has an elevator breakfast rooms are auper elegant and breakfast is outstanding full english breakfast buffet for   per person prepaid staff is very nice and helpful they have a nice bar area and a reception area with computer and printer area it is a great hotel and right across the street from kensington and hyde parks the initial room we had was very small and we had to upgrade to a bigger one the mattress felt as if it was very old as it was extremely soft and the springs felt broken the staff were very accomodating and helpful and the position was great the room was tiny just enough space to walk around the bed there was a computer that guest could use but the printer s cartridge was depleted and it was not changed after a request to do so nice and helpful staff beautiful lobby and sitting room on the ground floor and frescoed ceilings in the older part of the building well kept property and it has elevators the location is convenient to buses at the street corner and subway a block away short walk to the kensington gardens and hyde park as to the room the a c was optimal and you could open the window although just a bit if you wanted to however the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked the club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny no view as it was on the lower ground floor wouldn t stay here again the hotel was good overall with a bus route straight to piccadilly we were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working the alternate hotel is advertised as   star i don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other   star rated hotels i have stayed in it does not meet the high standard expected of a   star the bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average it was a real disappointment all the staff where lovely and very helpful the rooms were a little on the small side but adequate can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff value for money s the manager also left a personal welcome note for us in our room along with some little luxury items chocolates wine and soft drinks the children were delighted to have some goodies delivered room service too excellent start to our holiday room was a little small for u s standards but i was expecting it to be much smaller based on previous reviews very comfortable size for a european hotel pillows were a little hard and creeking floors from guests in room above were at times annoying but very minor no shower curtain but that s a european thing the hotel was in a perfect location between   tube stops giving you access to   tube lines a very high end hotel at a reasonable price and staff were great loved the beautiful interiors of the lobby stairs lounge and dining room room was very modern and up to date loved the high ceilings breakfast was excellent but started late so we didn t always eat breakfast there no negative the hotel is superbly located especially if you are attending a concert at the royal albert hall as we were rooms are clean and staff very helpful the buffet breakfast is sure to satisfy all tastes paid the supplement for the larger deluxe room but still very compact in size friendly and efficient staff great location and ideally placed for west london visits and proximity to paddington station good quality well cooked breakfast nice heritage styling to reception rooms and theatre bar for drinks we were put into the park grand paddington as the grand royale had a water problem we had paid for a superior double but our room was so small we couldn t even stand up next to each other in it a truly awful hotel free wifi the bedroom itself i found a bit small bed was very comfy staff are very nice

etc staff all excellent ready to help style and character of hotel reception areas our rooms were very small and didn t represent luxury or delux in our experience lovely reception bar and breakfast staff very friendly the room type superior double room was very small about   s m with no window location was fine very close to metro station paid for a delux double but very small and bed was so high up hotel was near a couple of tube stations and the breakfast was really good for the money it was a small room no room for two people really no restaurant for dinner very good location and relatively quiet the room was far too small we asked for a larger room which we got but even so they are too small for an average size couple no positive room was very small with a small staircase as soon as you open the door up to where the bed felt very cramped reception area no fridge in the std double some of the bathrooms are very small staff are friendly and helpful rooms are very clean and comfortable the rooms were a little small and the bathrooms only had showers which was fine for us staff were very friendly and accommodatingno negative small room but clean new professional staff good bed and thea coffee biscuits in the room very good dor a night over in london no negative i loved that the building was historical the entrance hall and front sitting room were especially beautiful though our room was more modern no negative the reception staff were very helpfull the facilities were excellent and the location was very good will definitely use the hotel again no negative nothing in fact this is a trick they will relocate you in a different location totally different compared to the initial booking no negative the staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble the breakfast was very good loved the theatre bar room a bit dated could do with some tlc stains on the bed cover smelly bathroom due to lack of extration located near the tube quiet room we were put in the annex separate building across the street more like a hostel the location is good easy to tube and buses room was very small was literally had to climb on the bed to get in as no room on either side of the bed where the hotel was situated if you want to pay by third person don t try it you will spend all day personal change his mind five times on one task very bad service no positive none we loved everything the location was perfect the staff was excellent and especially mariana who went over and above to make our stay great no negative the hotel was charming with wonderful history and atmosphere i enjoyed my cocktail in the glorious theatre bar before a stroll through hyde park poor if any phone signal in the basement close to the tube clean rooms basement level was a bigger room free wifi quiet rooms are really small but i think most of the rooms in london are the staff are soo nice specially a romainan guy in the reception the rooms are very small if you had a large bag it would be very tight lovely character building good friendly staff very comfortable beds the twin beds were right next to each other like a double bed and this was a club room lovely cosy room in a great location rooms there was no mini bar still water and small rooms and sofa bed was not set i called the just dropped bedings customer service room too small had to pay at check in conversion charge not explained at check in limited drinks in so called bar location rather small room but perfectly adequate for a few days lovely interior very clean and beautifully kept stain glass windows are a nice feature only thing that we didnt like was the cost of alcohol but it was the same everywhere in london the staff were very friendly helpfull room was small no place in bathroom to plug in a hair dryer wi fi not very reliable room was clean location was good no negative all in all excellent value extremely polite and helpful staff very welcoming very comfortable and clean and tidy   star stay nothing that i can think of brilliant a wonderful property with excellent staff nothing is too much trouble incredible attention to detail regarding my preferences from previous stays very expensive but worth it for a really indulgent stay no negative timeless elegance to this lovely hotel the staff made you feel special and on hand to help this was a very special treat for us and it was the right choice of hotel nothing the room we were given looked better than your pictures staff were amazingly helpful and when we left i felt as though good friends were saying good bye to us very personalised service superb breakfasts room size was so small we could not put any luggage on the floor which means completely unpacking and storing it or putting it under the bed the sitting area was really too small to eat at when we ordered room service would have liked a view of the park as it was just a sliver twice the hot water disappeared in the middle of a shower and twice someone was walking on the roof early in the am which woke us up we made our complaints know so hopefully resolved for next guest the service was absolutely exceptional and they were so welcoming and constant attention to your every need was worth a return trip for sure exceptional staff and willing to go overboard to make sure you feel like it is your home away from home they were kind enough to store our luggage for a side trip outside of london that we took prepare flowers for an event we attended and clean an outfit that another restaurant spilled on the bar staff especially jacamo and angelo were not only a delight but truly made our stay with their personalities and care it was nice to return to them after a day of site seeing or event attending always upbeat staff the structure itself and decor was so well done and enjoyed the colors and style very much so english and beautiful nice detail touches the ribbons on the table in the dining room and all the flowers were so well done a romantic and picturesque hotel worth staying at air conditioner was great beds are very high in case you are travelling with very small children and they fall off the bed other than that the hotel and staff were excellent friendliness of staff who went above and beyond to make the hotel feel like home no negative the staff at the milestone is what makes this place great i ve never stayed in a hotel with such friendly and helpful staff the hotel is small boutique yet the facilities are great it was pretty amazing to see how much they could fit into this place the location is also ideal just a short walk to the park across the street and close to shopping restaurants and the underground not worthwhile noting negatives possibly the best overall hotel experience especially in uk that we hav experienced in recent years staff exceptional and apart from one or two genuinely engaged with guests congratulations to management n staff no negative i stayed at the hotel for   nights this is definitely an exceptional hotel the staff is amazing no other words to describe their hospitality outstanding room indulging bathroom and amenities location is beautiful nearby kensington palace and kensington park definitely i ll come again i didn t like that we only stayed for one night the staff were extremely friendly yet proper i felt like royalty being there i especially enjoyed the location near a lot of different things nil exceptional clean room great location friendly staff nice welcoming l like it tooo much the room was amazing all staff were helpfully and friendly every things was amazing i really recommend this hotel for all my friend at   pm our room not ready and the check in was too late around   pm and early check out     pm maximum it s too small in space and the break fast by order menu not an open buffet massage room not prepared for that purpose and it s not too close to shopping center need a taxi friendly staff vintage english style hotel so quite and lovely live night musician i feel such as i live in my own home pool area could do with some tlc sauna was good though overall service was excellent couldn t do enough to serve your stay the breakfast selection was very good and all at a high standard bed a little firm but that s a personal choice and not a reflection on the quality and supberb facilities the attention to detail throughout the enture hotel should have a rating   out of   room is very very small especially the bathroom hard to walk or eat in the room when you have luggages very warm friendly polite and helpful staff i really like them hotel location is perfect walking distance to bus and station you could walk to harrods as well right face to kensington palace i love go jogging there in the morning no negative the milestone was absolutely beautiful filled with character the staff were outstanding always polite with nothing too much trouble first class we will certainly be back all staff were impeccably dressed acted in a professional manner at all times everything was immaculately clean all the meals were beautifully presented that we had to leave warm and welcoming atmosphere and staff lovely homely room quiet excellent breakfast we loved the various home made m eslis and the ready diced fresh fruits no negative very nice hotel and during our staying we enjoy seating in restaurant was our order afternoon tea and thanks for all staff who service us during our stay in hotel no negative the hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in london i was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink the area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable i opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone i met made me feel extremely special i only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time i would certainly stay again yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny no negative afternoon tea was lovely the service was impressive and we really adored fran who gave us a tour of the hotel and was most helpful in meeting all our needs from the bell hop to the concierge this hotel had the best service we ve ever experienced and we frequently travel via   star establishments we will return many times i m sure cannot think of anything other than the pool was a bit small but it is central london so a pool was a bonus for our boys the staff was amazing meeting all of our needs and more locating a sitter for my boys providing games water for our walks and scooters in the park they were fabulous the location is perfect right across from kensington gardens bit expensive the staff were very good especially the doorman who helped us consistently the decor was very plush although we were left with no toilet paper one day after the room was serviced too much knocking on my door in order to be at service sometimes less is the best everything was outstanding got upgraded asked for extra day and stayed in my upgraded room for price of smaller one awesome staff warm room fantastic breakfast and service want to go back now some of the upholstery in the lounge needed replacing the friendliness of all the staff without being overpowering nothing was too much trouble the bedroom was immaculate with a very comfortable queen size bed the two evening meals we had in the restaurant were superb no negative every thing was absolutely amazing an experience that i will never ever forget i enjoyed every single second and i will make sure that i book at this hotel next time i visit london nothing although the room is small however worth it in their services and location very classic hotel with very nice location staff there are all friendly and professional expensive extras valet laundry etc and room service taking cleaning things that were not always required to be taken cleaned bed service and staff all excellent got some fantastic few extras in the suite with it being our honeymoon leaving i loved my stay there the personalities of the staff shone the warmest of welcomes and each interaction professional and yet interested in our day such lovely people no negative absolutely everything was perfect a very classy hotel with a super range of experiences didn t really want to bother with the rest of london it was so good use of lounge for afternoon tea service tends to put you off using lounge for relaxation as all places are laid for tea service one can still use lounge but i felt i was intruding in some way level of service is excellent great location the lounge is used as a venue for afternoon tea so cannot be used just to relax and read etc one can use the bar or conservatory but these are not as comfortable as lounge service levels are excellent this is a small boutique hotel so the rooms are on the small side but the level of service provided by the staff is incomparable i just love this hotel room far too small location excellent decor staff excellent however we were in room   so small and difficult to even move around disappointing i would think for the price to to expensive for such a small room price too high for facilities and room size low ceiling due to the stairs at the entrance of the room limited options for an english breakfast besides the   types of meals which i skipped for a scrambled egg option no other foods were available expected more fruits and drinks professional staff clean better than the last   star meridian hotel which at stayed at in vienna in meridian vienna some one entered our room and opened the safe and took pounds dollars and kuwaiti dinars few from each on three different days a total of   dollars were stolen no negative i would highly recommend this hotel from the moment we arrived to the minute we left the staff at the hotel were more than attentive and made our stay very welcoming the hotel surpassed our expectations no tea and coffee making facilities in the room excellent location close to kensington gardens hyde park royal albrt hall shopping and underground station friendly and knowledgeable staff lovely furniture romantic no negative staff were nice and very accommodating went out of their way to make sure we had an amazing stay clean room great location great value it was all incredible georgia who gave us a tour of the hotel was brilliant very friendly and made our stay fab from start to endno negative cozy and luxury hotel smily staff that makes your mud for whole day super breakfast beautiful clean rooms attention for details room was a little small for a baby cot but kind of expected this in london breakfast was great staff especially concierge were very attentive we were there on friday night came back to the hotel at about  pm thinking we would like a quiet drink but there was very loud so called jazz being played in the only sitting area there was another bar area but we were told we could not use it so the only place was our room for such a large hotel there really should be somewhere to sit in comfort no positive the bathroom was small and the floor got wet when using the shower as there was no step or tray to contain the water made it slippery to use the toilet glass door got in the way of the entrance the spa facilities were poor and not very clean signage was lacking in the hotel made it difficult to find out where to go for the spa breakfast bar etc unless you asked staff food was great lots of variety and well laid out staff were helpful and friendly the hotel was a bit further from kings cross than expected there was no draught lager available on saturday night general standard of comfort throughout the hotel was excellent and bar prices were reasonable for a london hotel hotel was also quiet considering its size noisy aircon unable to open windows unable to use stairs and had to use lift crisp sheets room including bathroom was spotlessly clean modern smart interior friendly and efficient staff could not sleep all night as the people next to us were screaming and talking very loudly the room had a conjoining door this may have made it worse tried earplugs and knocking on the door but it didn t help the gym facilities were falling apart and very small the concierge and other staff were lovely and helpful big negative for me was the fact that the windows could nt open so there s no fresh air in the rooms the use of air conditioning for air resulted in me getting a really bad chest infection the pay on demand tv system did not work for our entire stay and no proper effort was made to try and rectify it good bedding nicely renovated property friendly staff in restaurants reception and housekeeping the lady that cleaned the room was very thorough air conditioning breakfast trays were not removed when room was cleaned on one day i had to ring   times and ask for someone to take the tray away visit ruined by extremely poor air conditioning and inability to open window the lifts are shaky for anyone nervous of these things the room got stuffy do needed aircon all night although weather unusually humid stayed one night room comfortable even if only a standard room very little noise of other occupants having to pay for the use of the pool when i am a staying at the hotel terrible having to wait a long time to check in and out very poor and slow service bed after waiting for   hours over our check in time i finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that i was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available i felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple then after walking around london all day we wanted to order room service after   trips to the reception and   broken phone we finally got   lots of fish and chips i never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect highly disappointed the room was comfortable and clean no negative the room was spacious and the twin beds were very spacious and comfortable the staff were friendly and accomodating they easily assisted with helping me even through busy moments breakfast can be very busy try to avoid the rush after  am the hotel has three lifts for the whole hotel and the stairs were closed for renovation can take a while to get anywhere during the very sumner season the london underground is a good     minutes walk from the hotel the staff were really helpful my car was broken into in the hotel car park staff not in the slightest bit interested had to drive home on seats of glass the day of sightseeing in london abandoned the hotel itself was fine as a building rooms okay etc location you really need a vehicle it s a   minute walk to the nearest tube station the facilities were excellent especially the club room and the breakfast it s   minutes at least from metro king s cross or russel station which is fine if you plan to stay out all day but it s a bit of a walk for some reason the alarm rang in the room the last day for   minutes and stopped hard way to wake up but overall everything was great de liked the fact that we could do early check in the beds were comfortable it s good to have a mini fridge in the room too the spa was great and good price     the massages were too expensive though the rooms had good isolation and the cleaning personnel was very discreet when doing the rooms on our floor also very thick curtains allowing you to sleep in it s close to a nice neighbourhood exmouth market where you can find a nice cafe called briki booking in and out was great for me my friends could have had slightly more friendly speedy service on reception long wait for lifts often very crowded the room and room facilities were very good location to event attending really suited us breakfast provision was excellent very clean nice decor location bit far from u g station you may need   min walk no attractions around the hotel the facilities are excellent leisure center is very good even it is with fee room staff facilities are very good room is very large since being refurbished and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza it seems what were previously   good sized rooms have now been made into   cramped rooms not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through probably the worst bathroom design i have ever seen the elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe   mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen the end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom my shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing   pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to   pounds i find it hard to believe that most people could eat   pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value not good value at all and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day on arrival i was told that since changing to crown plaza then the free wifi no longer requires login or password what they didnt point out was that the wifi is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and wifi is important although i didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level reception smells strongly of chlorine location at best is ok but not great with a good     minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc staff were friendly and helpful the only thing we said was that upon arrival to your room you get a free bottle of water and a small supply of tea coffee making facilities this is good if you re only staying one night but we stayed for   and would have appreciated the extra supplies bed was super comfortable lots to choose from at breakfast and unlimited tea and coffee what else could you want staff were very polite and helpful very good location anything that was too far on foot can be quickly accessed via public transport but remember to buy your oyster card because we forgot haha the room was smelly when we first checked in the ac was not working properly so at night i was sweating we turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air it was a beating the distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number   that would shuttle us from king s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra   minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time i liked the breakfast the room was not ready when i arrived i was told to come back at    pm which i did i then had to queue again this time for   minutes and it still was not ready no positive breakfast was fine but the staff that were on at breakfast didn t approach my table so made it a little difficult to grab somebody s attention when i had a question but it was perfectly adequate and very nice food it was a lovely hotel and it was in a great location the bedrooms were spacious and very comfortable and clean hotel staff were great i made use of the leisure facilities and the pool and spa was great the only thing i would say that would make the hotel better would be that there doesn t appear to be any buggy or wheelchair access from the lower lobby reception area up to the belgio and breakfast restaurants the staff in particular jason richmond and aneta were all amazing we were treated exceptionally well considering the nature of our stay was a child s hospital visit to great ormond street the leisure facilities at the hotel were not well sign posted or advertised in your room was able to get a good nights sleep the restaurant food was great everything was perfect everything the room was clean and big and had a great view the bathroom was perfect the location was great as the bus station was nearby i recommend this hotel service was atrocious initially i was told my room had been double booked so i had no where to stay then i was asked if it was ok to share a room with a total stranger staff were useless couldn t even get a tea bag brought up to my room stunning rooms fittings close to a number of attractions restaurants pubs very close to many public transport options odd little niggles with slightly dodgy switches lights but nothing major at all bright and modern comfortable rooms close to the main transport links while still seeming quiet and cosy the belgo bar restaurant is a great part of the set up i did not like room   where after getting out of the lift i had to lug my case down stairs in the hall i strongly resent having to pay for swimming pool in the hotel tea and coffee making facilities in the room the hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs probably the worst designed bathroom i have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about  mm the shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue i had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet staff were very helpful in this instance but i had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its wifi now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant i couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly   pounds if you buy vouchers in advance you get   pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around   to   pounds per night which is high it may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas i beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorineno positive we didn t have time to take advantage of pool as we had plans with friends it took     hrs in an uber to get to gatwick airport very fancy offered free pool use too having to pay as i went the computers were down lovely room very comfortable bed brilliant bar and restaurant and the wait staff were very welcoming and helpful very slow reception staff not very welcoming considering a   star hotel more a free for all to get seen and staff do not listen to customers bad to see them smoking in uniform at side of restaurant was ok once there but expect    min walk if your good at walking to nearest tube station really bad for location nice bed and bathroom breakfast excellent quality although it s only     you have to pay extra to use the gym staff were really helpful and welcoming i asked in advance if we could have a room with   double beds as i was staying with my twin daughters and the reservations assistant was really helpful the rooms were clean comfortable and had tea and coffee making facilities which was great too it was a long walk from kings cross station with cases over rough footpaths staff were helpful the room was comfortable and quiet and the location was close to the museums and the british library location was a little further from kings cross station than hoped for   mins walk but other than that all good comfortable rooms with decent beds very clean and quite spacious bathroom nice and clean with bath and shower over it really nice freshly cooked breakfast on both mornings of our stay no information in room on the hotel facilities quiet hotel in convenient location very clean and recently refurbished nice bathroom with rainfall shower the room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night hotel was very comfortable and the facilities were great nice bar and restaurant business men in particular were assured more than casually dressed folk soaked from the sudden torrential rain while queuing to check in manually as systems were down that friday the onsite restaurants especially belga were great waiters were attentive and food was fab shower pressure was ace i ate at the belgo restaurant one evening the food was only just warm the waiter did not offer any condiments and i could not get his attention again i ended up leaving most of the food as it was too dry some of the attention in the bathroom could have been better i moved to another room where the toilet was coming away from the wall but accepted this since i didn t want to be next to the lift the mini bars are empty meaning not even being able to have any bottled water late evening or early morning two times i went to the fitness and spa and not all facilities were possible due to cleaning these could be done out of hours but at least cleansiness maintenance was paramount the only complaint there is that they should visit the sauna there was wood worms by the door coming from the wood frames the breakfast choice was of a very good standard and plenty to choose from definitely worth the value charge to use the pool gym location a bit weird about a   min walk from kings cross room a decent size bed comfy and everything very new clean and good condition gets marked down for two reasons even as a guest you have to pay to use the pool and gym and secondly a very long check in time as computers down but had been down for   days it s far from a big supermarket but store in front was good to get something the hotel is very near to where we always go for shopping like oxford street very accessible to all we booked a room with   double beds but there was not one available and so we were given a standard double room the guests in the next room were very loud and partied with doors banging until  am the air conditioning was noisy making a rattling noise all the time which seemed to become more noticeable when you tried to sleep the room was not overly clean and the remote for the tv seemed to be mood dependent when it wanted to work at breakfast the food was lovely but the dining room was a mess tables were not cleared there was cutlery missing from the table no one offered tea or coffee at the table or directed you where to find anything there was no printed information about the hotel or its facilities in the room we did not even know it had a pool or spa bed was really comfy and shower was excellent although it did soak the floor plenty of power sockets in the room cocktails served in the bar were a lovely way to finish a busy day parents allowing their children to dive in the pool food was excellent in the restaurant and the breakfast in the morning very friendly and efficient staff see above all else was greatthere was a problem in the dining room at dinner on a sunday night there was no decaffeinated coffee and there seemed nothing could be done about it as the machine they used only took one kind of coffee the machine in other area only made large quantities i had invited a friend for dinner i discussed with dr manager and he deducted an amount from our bill but it seemed totally ridiculous clearly the pm had not done the job he she should the breakfast guests on monday would have an issue too the bathroom was designed with looks in mind but not practicality the oversized sink undersized tap shower without glass etc i think an art major designed this with no practicality in sight d quick easy stay helpful staff we had complaints of noise when we had music from a small bluetooth speaker on a friday night as we were getting ready to go out for dinner ridiculous also you have to pay to use the poor or gym i don t know of any hotel that requires that the lobby and reception were nice the hotel was a   minute walk from kings cross station with a suitcase this was a nightmare ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions main toilets in the hotel were on level   in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment when arriving at the hotel in the morning i couldnt check in until  pm and needed the toilet what they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in very strange and i was not advised of any of this upon checking in overall very disorganised and customer service not great no positive i only know that they charge us to use the pool and gym their website is deceiving giving the impression that like most hotels those facilities are available to guests free of charge the location is also a bit far from the closet tube station though the name carries king s cross it is like   mins walk from the king s cross station and since king s cross is a big station it would take     mins from hotel door to platform the rooms are clean and quiet housekeeping cleaning of the room if you don t leave money housekeeping will not leave shampoo toilet paper and water location of hotel is great it s the real center of london breakfast is good but a bit expensive the best is location of the hotel it s the real center of london had to pay extra to use spa facilities and wasn t part of the hotel as expected you had to go out of the hotel and into the cellar suprising after staying at other crown plaza hotels i emailed the hotel and got no reply room was lovely and good decor throughout few small details could have been better tv remote didn t work and there was no welcome note or hotel details booklet comfy and spacious room and staff were helpful there was a long wait for check in however believe it was due to the ba cancellations so understand we were celebrating our friends  th birthday at piano works down the road coming from bristol on the train tube we found the hotel modern comfortable with large room for london the price was reasonable and staff were friendly the bedroom was quiet and comforting after a long day night out it has a nice central location and the following day visited tower of london and carnaby street on tube we especially loved the rain shower there is an additional charge for using the leisure facilities reception staff discourteous at times concierge was helpful room was quite and comfortable room service was very weird the waiter barged into the room without being asked to creating a very awkward situation he also didn t carry a card payment terminal amazing bedding and very nice bed size also the desk with international power outlets was very guest friendly not much overall a good experience all of the staff were courteous and hard working to find fault would be picking holes but there are little improvements that can be made but overall a great place to stay made better by the staff location far from everything impossible to open the windows in the room lavatories in works at the lobby   restaurants very comfortable rooms no computer for guests although i think there will be one in the future doorway to bathroom was narrow and the door had a tall handle so it was awkward getting in and out of the bathroom very little space between bed and desk good food and service in the hotel s restaurants and bar two double beds in the room proximity to kings cross station which is why we were there there are still some minor surface issues like the door leading to my room having had its handle removed looked messy but i understand the hotel is in process of transformation i ve stayed here a few times now and always find it comfortable and welcoming great location access to kings cross dickens museum restaurants and british library not far walk from these places the waitress staff at breakfast could have been more attentative i e asking if we required tea or coffee when being seated instead of us having to ask for it also on arrival at the hotel we were told that there was no booking for us yet i clearly had a confirmation email from booking com telling me that it was booked this caused us some anguish after a   hour journey the receptionist eventually sorted us out after a   minute wait beds very comfy pleasant friendly staff no complaints everything was fine the room was comfortable and it was possible to have a small breakfast in the cafe rather than the big buffet i also really liked the bathroom set up car park spaces were ridiculously small scratched our   plate mercedes due to one of your staff misguiding us in   for car park over night which is shocking breakfast was vile and everything was hard and cold ladies toilets were in the basement   floors from reception and was like a building site health and safety oh and only   spaces in the car park nothing no complaints the bed was really comfy and the location was excellent the hotel is looking really good after the recent refurbishment i didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on food i also didn t get a chance to use the pool or gym but i would definitely like to return and give them a try i was asked was there a reason for the trip i said it was for my daughter in law and son s birthdays also there wedding annervesary which was all in that week of booking i had been informed they would have a bottle of wine waiting for them nil given breakfast very good had to pay as we went along their computer systems were down and so nothing could be charged to the room the staff were lovely that s really nice especially when travelling as a lone female the room was very small for the price when using the shower it soaked the bathroom floor the hot food wasn t so hot and was a little disappointing my room was not cleaned nor new towels provided despite being out of the hotel for       hours not the service i expect for the price the staff were apologetic but not remotely sincere about it hotel was nice breakfast options were good never use booking com again had a nightmare and they don t actually make bookings who knew avoid at all costs nothing but hassle hotel was busy but staff still had time for you trying to order room service took over   minutes a number of calls to reception that did not finish the call before putting the phone down and the kitchen restaurant not answering the phones also the worst part was the fact that all the systems were down so i was unable to get a receipt on booking in they tried applying a  nd charge then on checking out still unable to get a receipt and still today i have been unsuccessful in gaining a receipt meaning i shall not be able to claim on my expenses for the accommodation despite a number of messages to the hotel and calls i still have not got a receipt very disappointing and would recommend booking com removing them room size and facilities were great reception and concierge handled by trainees it system broke down a few days before and not fixed very good and large breakfast choice acceptable room size and cleaniness spa more than expected bellboy was extremely rude when we asked to store our luggage asked us to drag our bags across the lobby just to drag them back then made us feel as if we were inconveniencing him when that s his job for   a night it s the least we expect no positive the gym was horrendous i paid   to use a few  kg dumbbells it shouldn t list that they even have a gym value for money is terrible to be fair when compared to others in the area great reception looks a lovely hotel nice room the view and no porters to help with luggage our view was the back yards of a row of house on the back side of the hotel we got the furthest room from the elevators and no help was available to take our luggage close to a variety of restaurants a block away easy walk to them just past the major royal mail building the cooked breakfast was practically cold this was on both mornings so was not a one off case we would have been better off going room only and eating out the staff were not helpful on arrival this was our first time here and we had no idea where to find anything it would have been helpful if they had asked if we had been here before and if not they should have a taken the time to tell us where things were apparently there is a bar somewhere reception staff looked miserable and unapproachable all in all not a very friendly hotel the rooms were spacious and comfortable and had everything that you could possibly neeed tv hairdryer iron kettle safe fridge plus some extras shoe mit needle kit etc lovely bathrooms with excellent shower being very picky but perhaps a mirror on the wall near to the hairdryer assistance from staff was excellent when required hotel room was light and airy and the pool facilities were excellent slept very well indeed wifi was not accessible in our room at all the room was really speacious and the bed comfortable the staff was really helpful and nice and were resolving our needs fast the location of the hotel is good just   min walk from king s cross there is nice neighbourhood in the close vicinity of the hotel with small shops and restaurants which was quite useful everything was clean and in order no negative the bed was super comfortable and we had an upgrade to a executive room i guess the staff was understanding us and also the wifi was really fast and good when i came back to the hotel almost    pm my room wasn t made up i found this a bit annoying as i had been out and about since    am and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready while at the lounge i waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly however when it came to paying for the drink i found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink the chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings room was very well appointed clean and comfortable breakfast was good i had to move to another hotel during the week end because the fare was too expansive but this is london everything was perfect the room was large and quite the bed very comfortable you can walk to the hotel from st pancras station no need to take a taxi charge for pool i only have cereals for breakfast told receptionist this and there was no mention of a small breakfast when i said i didn t want to pay     for cereals toast and drink very nice room comfortable and clean after paying a lot you have to pay to go for a swim or to the gym the bath shower were a bit high and therefore getting into the shower is a struggle for small people comfortable room bed good tv good the hot water for the bath never achieved anywhere near   degrees the room was very warm even though the ac was turned down to it s lowest setting and i overheard another guest complaining about this at checkout when i went to open the room door from the inside i happened to look up and there was a gap between the ceiling and the door frame of about     a foot filled with wires which was a bit disconcerting on checkout i was asked to wait while they checked my room for damages yup while they checked my room for damages that is literally what the receptionist told me i told her i was very insulted and she said i m sorry and then shrugged the shrug was the last straw i m not sure the british are very good with shrugs so i took it to the manager who was very receptive and listened carefully and promised to report the woman to her manager i wouldn t return again i ve had these problems with   star hotels before it s always better to go high or modest not somewhere that is trying too hard to live off the parent companies name it is a very clean hotel with large comfortable rooms and super housekeeping and room service staff when i speak at author events i want the anonymity of a large generic hotel i feel it gives me the space to prepare they let me stay an extra hour in the room to take some pain medication for a headache which was very kind it was advertised with a spa but did not mention it was run separately from the hotel and had an extra cost to use the facilities very disappointed with the spa hot tub was out of order swimming pool so small could not swim and member of leisure staff not helpful no positive restaurant was on the expensive side i would prefer to give a tip than it be added to my bill shame about the hot tub being out of order very clean hotel friendly staff it was a little expensive for the food provided as after a certain time there was only sandwiches and crisps even though the menu said fries the staff was so friendly and more than happy to help with any questions there was always a cleaner in the spa area and on the room floors the bed the bed was too hard for me and the location a bit too far from a tube to be helpful but walking to bloomesbury was easy and the staff were really helpful if the bed had been softer i would have been happier drinks in the bar were very expensive so we probably won t use the bar again staff were lovely and place was clean specially porter young man on reception was very helpful and got us a taxi etc the shower needs a longer door or a supplemental curtain everything was great except that the shower door only went half way across so water went onto the floor they let us check in early which was great nice tv decent wifi new looking rooms nothing the hotel provided all that was needed from friendly staff at the reception efficiency in check in room service and comforts were ideal staff in all areas of the hotel were most friendly and helpful lacks character and charm bar area is nice and breakfasts very good they charge you to use the leisure facilities even if you are a guest nice clean rooms and bathrooms friendly staff location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep the queue for the check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time the staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in no positive when we first went into our room there was no kettle this was reported to reception at once as we would have liked a hot drink on our arrival i phone reception an hour later still no kettle at    pm we decided to go out for a walk and to have a hot drink else where on the way out complained again about the kettle on our arrival back at the hotel at    pm kettle was in our room the welcome from the staff as soon as you walked into the hotel was great and the overall look of the hotel was welcoming as well none this is a newly renovated property everything is perfect i love the hotel and decor it s very comfortable it s not luxury but it s modern i would stay again breakfast is very generous the room size for the price we paid very cramped not enough cupboard space we stayed there a week the room was very clean and the beds very comfortable but was rather cramped the breakfast was excellent and the service in the breakfast room was very good all the staff were very friendly and helpful location was very convenient bus service just outside the hotel and underground stations within walking distance about   minutes walk the walk to kingscross was not very pleasant a little shadey and quiet i would rather recommend people to walk to russell square tube station very pleasant walk that way they charged us     pounds to use the pool and fitness room the rooms are super small and there was no wifi for the first   days of our stay and when they did get wifi the connection was super slow i would not stay at a crown plaza again the location pull out sofa bed wasn t made up on the first night like we re were advised but as i had a long day and the fact i was ill and already sleeping my auntie who was sleeping on the bed didn t want to call for someone to make the bed so slept with out and quilt or pillow the following night the bed was made up the express breakfast i ordered to the room was fantastic and great value also staff were very helpful and friendly great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family staff were not great we asked for our luggage to be picked up and said there will be someone there straight away i waited   mins before calling again and they then told me they were too busy to collect them i had   suitcases the room was very clean and had everything needed for a good relaxing sleep we had heavy luggage and the walking distance was further than had anticipated easy route by taxi or bus good accomodation at a reasonable price fairly near to kings cross station the bed was extremely comfortable and the bar staff friendly and helpful we rang to reception to find out about the spa to be told it was in the basement we then had to call at reception to ask again as the lift didn t go to the basement due to refurb work that was all fine except it gave the reception staff two opportunities to tell us we needed to pay to use the facilities which would have saved my hubby from having to go right back to the room for money jacuzzi then not working when we got in there did think the spa let the hotel down it was clean and comfortable overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally location was not as convenient as expected and despite king s cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about   gbp taxi fare away this hotel did not suit me personally on arrival the receptionist spoke so quickly that we couldn t understand we were disappointed to find out we had to pay for the pool this was not clear on the website the jacuzzi wasn t even working and the pool was smaller than it looked on website i chose the hotel based on the photos of the pool so very disappointing the bedroom but especially the breakfast restaurant was uncomfortably warm more air needed in there the bedroom was clean comfortable and a good size the bathroom was modern and attractive although water splashed everywhere due to the design of the shower there was an excellent choice of food at breakfast and it was all delicious the location was not ideal but there are buses and taxis going past regularly so it wasn t a real problem the pool was ice cold due to breakdown or maintenance but obviously couldnt be helped the room was lovely clean and comfortable breakfast good variety and pleasent atmosphere charge of     per visit to swimming pool very poor show belgo restaurant evening meal too small staff unable to increase portion size indicating to me it s all out of a packet great staff especially trainee consiage i made sure it had parking but it really didn t and they charged   pounds for parking which they failed to inform i also booked in for breakfast it s was     and they charged me   and then had to go up to the room   times before the access card actually worked the quality of food from room service was poor and not cheap it was clean staff was helpful to solve several issues which was the downside there were smell of cigarettes in the room and for me as non smoker it wasn t nice i felt like being in ashtray big nice and tidy room with two big beds the room was way too hot even with air con on not able to open windows had to pay for pool facilities which was not stated on the website not cool water in the bath didn t get very hot bed was lovely kevin who made the cocktails made my staff rating a bit better as he was amazing reception staff weren t great not really much interaction thank god for kevin as he made it a much better experience all the bar staff were great actually great location and really clean room limited and expensive overnight parking expensive bar and the receptionist who didn t ask for the registration of our car which could have resulted in us being charged   had we not enquired later the cleanliness and super comfy bed reception area very modern and bright too bad it is not closer to st pancras or near a tube station you have to walk at least  min to get to a station or st pancras spacious room modern and comfortable the great breakfast efficient staff the hotel was under refurbishment and some facilities were not available the closest underground station is kings cross station and it takes around   minutes walking good choice of hotel good room facilities clean and spacious room had to squash against the wall whilst showering to stop the shower flooding the bathroom floor no refund available when we accidentally booked the wrong dates through the online booking system so we had to pay twice good choice for breakfast clean comfortable and spacious rooms difficult to put plug in bath due to fixed shower screen also the hot water not very hot for bath and shower yet hand basin hot water very hot very comfortable clean and well presented room i thought i d booked the holiday inn bloomsbury but got holiday inn kings cross bloomsbury although it is in fact a crown plaza hotel it was a good   mins walk away from where i wanted to stay i ll book hotel direct next time quiet room comfortable beds excellent breakfast gym charge not made clear but see above i was charged for by the gym which isn t made clear but the lovely reception staff said it didn t matter very lovely staff post brexit the sevice industry is going to suffer nothing major but maybe a few more car parking spaces as we arrived friday to it being full and was so all weekend up until the sunday we liked everything about the hotel so much that we booked an extra night would highly recommend the staff are all lovely and the rooms are kept very clean     nothing but confused as booked holiday inn and no one said it had been rebranded as crown plaza been previously recently been rebranded everything was excellent would have liked tea and coffee access in room not only via room service to pay another     charge for it as well also be nice if leisure centre access included as free to residents not     extra fantastic room lovely staff in restaurant v helpful luxury surroundings nice to have a pool and gym on site as well and very centralno negative the buffet breakfast was fantastic the beds pillows linen and towels were all high quality all the staff i dealt with performed their jobs flawlessly breakfast was okay there s a good selection of food but eggs weren t cooked enough and black pudding was overdone pool closes to children at    hrs think this should be later as we didn t get the chance to use it and kids were upset staff were lovely and helpful room very comfortable and clean the rain shower was wonky so when turned on water sprayed everywhere when i adjusted the head of the shower the dirt that was on top of it was disgusting the staff where friendly but we had to wait a long time for bags to be put into storage no positive the booking for a smoking room was not reflected in my initial room assignment luckily they had one remaining if this is your preference you may wish to call ahead to make sure the room type you reserved is honored at check in otherwise a pleasant stay no positive the air con didn t work in the bedroom we were not able to open the window so extremely hot we only had one robe in a double room food and service was amazing i booked a smoking room and but was told there was no smoking room booking com must make sure it is only available to book when there is availability location one member of staff was rude we booked a smoking room with a queen bed and bath we were given a non smoking room smaller bed and no bath when we contacted staff about this they came across rude and didn t accommodate us the room we paid for we expected the room we paid for and that s what we should have got the bed was comfy the pool was great and location was perfect the hotel is situated a good   minute walk to the closet tube station so if you plan to get around london via public transport you ll need to factor in a fair bit of walking hotel was extremely comfortable and very quiet the room was a good size and had everything i needed room was warm too warm in fact a day air con wasn t particularly good selection of tv also wasn t great if your not into sport good that sky sports was included but general channel selection was only adequate and movies were pay per view additionally the pool wasn t inclusive and should have been for this level of hotel although not expensive location and facilities were good and reasonable for price breakfast was of good quality and selection on offer was good got extremely warm aircon seemed to have little effect exacerbated by the windows unable to open at all bed exceptionally comfortable bathroom was beautiful great shower pool and fitness facilities were a brilliant perk after hectic travelling only complaint is that the room kettle should be inspected more often for calcification and cleanliness rooms seems to have been refurbished recently which is great modern and classy and comfortable the room while recently renovated and is very comfy has a very bad bathroom design the glass screen only extends half way so there is no way that the bathroom floor will be dry when you shower as the water will definitely splash there the staff were very attentive and breakfast was very complete and yummy there aren t any restaurants nearby you have to take a bus to get to the main part of london however it s only a  min bus journey i was served by elisa on front desk and she was amazing and very friendly i wanted a late checkout  pm and they were happy to do that with no extra cost the hotel room was clean and the room size was a reasonable size would definitely stay here again not a dislike necessarily but we found the tea coffee making facilities when we were checking out they are in a drawer this keeps the room neat and tidy but we completely missed them the room is well laid out with everything you would expect for a pleasant stay although compact that s the norm for standard rooms in london hotels though the hotel is also within easy walking distance to sadler s wells and a little further to the british museum the breakfast time was extremely busy and they constantly ran out of items so we had to keep asking hence having to constantly wait until they replenished this really was rather annoying also i would suggest bringing pots of coffee tea to the table for the guests so the guests don t have to get up constantly also the location is a lot further from a tube station than initially thought approximately   min walk so we had to uber quite a bit on an evening where typically we would use the tube complimentary water in the room after arriving after a long journey a member of staff woman was giving us weird looks as if we were not welcomed there we were very tired and got asked a lot of u reasonable questions and got asked for two id cards one of the keys wasn t working either amazing bed setting great coffee and tea facilities really enjoyed our stay here after the check in we were told we were being upgraded to an executive room and in the same sentence we were told that the room was not very good but hey it s an upgrade we didn t understand why we were being upgraded to a smaller room surely that s a downgrade the bottles of water and chocolate and other little touches were nice but was not worth the upgrade the bed was very comfortable the pillows however could do with more choice perhaps a soft and a firm it was further away from kings cross station than implied i picked the hotel on the basis i needed to be on an early train and that wasn t ideal the shower was awesome the walls had holes carpets look worn out and paint on walls wasn t finished needs refurbishment the food the room looked nice and big with a good view and the bed was comfy no negative recently refurbished excellent location quiet but a   minute walk to bus routes into the centre   stops from kings cross union tavern opposite has excellent food need to book it is popular not a good location with   young kids a long way to nearest tube station they say   mins but it s   a lot of bus hopping done it s now crown plaza group not holiday inn swimming pool freezing cold costs extra each day room didn t have enough bath towels for all of us or tea making facilities biscuits tv problems apparently just this weekend really annoying staff very helpful in reception and breakfast lounge clean tidy contemporary furniture fittings comfy beds great choices for breakfast the hotel rebranded to crown plaza the day i booked and it took over an hour to find walking late at night in the rain the hotel has now red exterior and crowne plaza signage not green and white holiday inn no one at the hotel or booking com thought to tell those who had booked that the hotel had chnaged name and brand these idiots are still calling it holiday inn for gods sake it eventually cost me   quid in taxis and going to the holiday inn bloomsbury to find it the hotel is the crowne plaza kings cross change the bloody name for gods sake and tell your clients bookers beware that said the rebrand and make over makes this a real premium hotel not at all like holiday inns the makeover is not   complet but prices refelcet this and right now its good vlaue no positive staff knocking on the door and male staff entering without warning plus we asked for extra towels but they didn t come we asked for a refund on our room but not sure if we got that though the assistant manager was sympathetic head board of the beds were soft nice wet room no negative i was accompanying my daughter for an audition and she had forgot to print something off that she required the reception staff let her use their computer and printer and saved the day the bar only had lagers and ciders no good if you drink guinness breakfast could be better had to wait for bacon my wife said that some of hers was cold service was good we arrived early and were able to leave luggage room was great good bathroom loud music from guests below us woke us up and when we informed reception at   am nothing was done the pool and spa facilities weren t available and that was one of the reasons why we booked the hotel modern interiors great shower friendly staff mussels restaurant next door is delicious changing from hi to crowne plaza not sure on room allocations upgraded room was   double beds felt small breakfast on sunday was chaos run out of lots of things staff not effective slow lots of it was average wanted continental breakfast but the the meat cheese looked dried out the pastrys didn t taste fresh staff were friendly but had difficulty when asked for were the tube was as and taxi not sure if the staff understood us most hotel kitchens seem to be unable to cook bacon properly this was no exception lack of a public lounge area and no toilets near bar or restaurant toilets where available in the cold basement below reception but where very poor breakfast was good with plenty of choice room had recently been refurbished very comfortable bed and seating area for a standard room shower was really good and probably best one i have ever used in any hotel the restaurant staff were shockingly slow and rude no idea of customer service and no response from management when complaining very expensive menu as well this with rude staff who do not have a good understanding of english is very poor the hotel was clean and well priced perhaps a better design in the bathroom shower was next to the window so water went all over the blind road noise was intrusive better double glazing possibly room was spacious and clean and quiet no noise late at night the only minor minus was   minutes walk to the nearest underground station but still not something big really very clean and comfortable room great belgo restaurant downstairs if you only are fan of belgian beer everything as it should be in a good hotel restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best every option i asked for they were out only one salad option no soup but i could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished i had room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot i don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep the point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting when i booked i asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival i will not be using this hotel again room was modern and clean the layout of the room specifically that the desk chair backs right into the bed making it awkward to sit or stand and if there had been a guest with me impossible to navigate from the sitting area to the door or bathroom kind of an odd thing to do i found the renovations very good and a nice surprise wellness section is for extra price maybe just the only bad news for bookers but no more complaining the staff was increadibly polite and helpfull the building is fascinating everything in excellent condition there s no any microdust or neighter a spot in our well equiped modern rooms the beds our comfortable and clean made us feel us home the breakfast was if it had made for the prime minister we enjoyed the wide range of many sort of foods and the kindness of the staff special thanks for the hungarians there i had to pay for the gym my room service was due in   minutes and took   the salad i ordered was covered in olives despite no mention on the menu the towels were thin and tiny the fan in the bathroom was noisy and i was unable to turn it off terrible night i will not be back the shower shower flooded the bathroom bad design remote took   presses to get a button to work one room key didn t work long queue at reception to get it changed toilets a long way from breakfast bread at breakfast was stale looks nice i was a little disappointed that the sauna was so small and i was a little alarmed about the light floating in the pool that had come loose i reported but the staff were fully aware and was in the process of getting it sorted out and although my room was lovely and clean i did see a pair of pliers that were left on the floor by the lamp that i luckily avoided stepping on as it was almost hidden by the curtain i also ordered breakfast to my room where some of the food items were cold so that was a little disappointing too but overall i had a pleasant stay the room was a lovely size and included all the equipment that might be needed through my stay i e ironing board and iron the hotel itself is in a good location and exceeded my expectations for a holiday inn it was really clean and comfortable and i fully enjoyed my stay would have liked a wider menu in restaurant light bites and sandwiches at lunch time the beds were very comfy lovely clean fresh room very friendly staff breakfast was plentiful and tasty only criticism the cooked items were not hot enough but i appreciate its hard to maintain high temps on a hot plate service nothing greeted by excellent members of staff both at the front desk and in the restaurant free wifi cleanliness excellent room had really comfy beds tea making facilities and mini fridge the restaurant belgo has a great selection of beers ales wines and cocktails really enjoyed our stay we stayed in a   double bed room which had been refurbished nearest tube is russell square you also have kings cross and holborn within   minute walkno negative comfortable bed clean room excellent breakfast didn t use the pool consierge very helpful with bus information staff all friendly hotel now crowne plaza not holiday inn there were a small set of stairs between the lifts and the room may sound picky but with a big heavy case it was a real pain the newly refurbished rooms are extremely comfortable well designed and the bathrooms are excellent really impressed at the value for money no negative the room was a perfect size and lovely layout and the breakfast was definatly worth paying extra for i actually forgot i was still in the country and thought i was at an all inclusive abroad with a very nice english breakfast and other things to go with it lifts were very slow and over crowded we had to wait for   lifts before we could get in one there weren t clear signs to the stairs which we would have taken instead building work happening in the hotel which we were not aware of prior to stay and the hotel bar area was unstaffed when we got back for a nightcap at  pm location was great and rooms clean and comfortable not the best view wine glasses were fab we had a quick drink before we headed out we stayed in a refurbished room the bathroom and beds were wonderful we had a great night s sleep staff were really friendly and ever so helpful in getting us a taxi organised the walls are paper thin terrible nights sleep hours of coughing and snoring from the bedroom next door lots of noise from the corridor bed and room lovely no information in room about facilities meal times etc charge of     for use of swimming pool for residents is not acceptable very comfortable room with lovely bathroom breakfast was very good and included in price unusual for london breakfast room very dated tea coffee out of flasks no poached or fried eggs fruit selection poor fan in our bathroom on all night asked for handyman to take a look told no one available consequently didn t sleep much first night but second slept like a log quite location the room was lovely clean comfortable modern parking i phoned to ask about parking to be told that there were   spaces but could not be reserved and were only available on a first come first served basis however when we arri ved no spaces available but two spaces had clearly been reserved ncp parking   mins away cost   for   hours a wonderful receptionist aneta debosz who could not have been more helpful thank you would have been good to be made aware of the pool went an hour and a half early and was checked in no problems and allowed us to keep our bags there i till our train home the food served in hotel was not the greatest the dining room was also not ideal but we appreciate this may be due to renovations initial first impressions of hotel was impressive we were aware of renovations hotel room was great as well as spa facilities and reasonably priced the food served in the hotel could have been better in my opinion the breakfast could have been better choice was limited such as fried eggs not being available food was good quality only complaint would be the choice property just refurbished so room was very modern extremely comfy bed and bathroom was amazing with waterfall shower and a nice deep bath room very spacious also the room was very small the bed too we go   towel everyday i had to call with my telephone as the phone in the room did not work for new towels every day staff where nice the only downside was our hotel room had only a shower and no bath excellent location staff were friendly no complaints about breakfast selection room was fantastic clean and tidy the restaurant and bar area seemed a bit depressing e g no windows and too crowded the location is slightly inconvenient but overall we got a fair deal the room was spacious and tastefully furnished we also really liked the bathroom wanted to use gym but was closed quiet clean comfortable and spacious rooms ordered food to the room said about   minutes but food came sooner the price of food excellent considerng the portion size nothing first time in london and the hotel was fantastic we were given a free upgrade to twin room with double beds shower was hot and powerful staff were extremely helpful and professional at all times room service was quick and food was hot the breakfast was varied and plentiful i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone the hash browns felt overly reheated soft instead of crisp the bed was very comfortable and and shower was absolutely amazing staff at reception were very helpful and efficient   mins swift walk to nearest tube station russell square renovations underway but no noise in hotel at times we were there complimentary upgrade to higher floor appreciated breakfast was excellent even though it was in temporary dining space on basement level coffee for breakfast could be better the breakfast becomes repetitive after   days over   mins walk to the nearest subway everything was great clean and new good breakfast the works are still on but it was not a problem coffee and bacon at breakfast poor paid parking at   pounds was high should be split into shorter time periods great location comfy beds and proper curtains that block out sun most people traveling on business travel really early to make  am meetings london being a metropolitan you d think people could book in at  am at least luckily for me i could freshen up and get to court by  am your staff from reception to pool breakfast and room service were all friendly and professional honestly was a pleasure being in the hotel gym and pool facilities layout in lobby area was poor sliding doors were not open twice bar downstairs was not in keeping with the standard in the rest of the hotel nice room due to renovations there were only lifts to get to the rooms not good for someone who is claustrophobic the one we got into stopped as it did not go to our floor the prosecco ordered to the room as a surprise for my husband s birthday was not there no hot water in hotel the following morning the room was obviously newly refurbished and very clean staff dealt with the unfortunate problems we encountered quickly we were given a generous   reduction as there was no hot water in the morning and the prosecco was provided free of charge don t charge   to use the lame gym in the basement horrible and i am a holiday inn rewards member so stupid from a business standpoint location no where to put   let alone   suitcases except floor or lounge housekeeping was a bit hit and miss cups and glasses not always cleaned replaced and carpet not vacuumed once in   days the restaurant was terrible we were made to feel belittled because we didn t have a booking webpage just says come and join us no mention of need to book when we could see spare tables for what we received the food was overpriced small portions and my salmon caesar salad was just a hot piece of salmon dumped onto lettuce with the barest hint of dressing croutons or parmesan cheese quite tasteless beautiful newly renovated room bed was bliss bathroom was great with rainhead shower and nice toiletries quiet room with blackout curtains loved the desk which has power points and usb connections reception staff were very welcoming and helpful staff were not very friendly and seemed like the guests were a irritant that interfered with what they were doing the room was absolutely lovely loved the complimentary fridge loved the space and the bathroom non most mirror fab empty area without any big chances for good meals breakfast ok but not available some foods for example fried eggs nice hotel close to king cross train station and also easy to get to the airports wifi issues on the  st floor although they were solved thanks to great customer service amazing customer service solved problems and offered solutions when we arrived we walked up to the gentleman at the first desk pod and said we d like to check in he pointed towards   identical pods to his right and said reception there was no way to know which one he meant no signage and at that moment no one behind any of them we then saw a woman return to one so went to her and checked in the room was small and badly laid out could barely walk between desk and bed and could barely pull out chair enough to sit down the floor of the bathroom floods when shower used these are new rooms food was served in the basement as temporary measure while refurbishing badly photocopied menus and ill tempered staff we left and found somewhere local to eat though quite tired bed was comfortable room was clean sound proofing could be improved could hear muffled sound of neighbour ladies laughing and speaking air cond is also too noisy could also hear water passing through pipes as neighbouring taps were turned on and off beautiful room superb shower room the fire alarm went off several times during the night the hotel is quite a walk from king s cross st pancras station very nice hotel relatively big rooms tidy environment they gave discount due to fire alarm issues no negative great location with excellent transport links undergoing refurbishment we had a redecorated room good breakfast helpful staff great supper at the union tavern opposite i did not enjoy the quality of the food in the breakfast eggs fruits nothing tasted really fresh and i wanted to have a cappuccino but it was not included in the breakfast rate they only give black coffee and the worst thing during my   day stay was the fact that one elevator was not working so there was a long queue to take the lifts the location of this hotel is good because it s only   minutes walk   km from king s cross train station i thought the use of the gym and pool was included in the price but it wasn t you had to pay extra bed was comfy lovely bath and shower food was good breakfast was average porridge and bananas lacking no marmite or kippers in evidence rolls and croissants slightly stale but staff most helpful especially as we had a three year old child with us fabulous new decor superbly comfortable beds no hot water endless queues to get breakfast i think we must have caught the hotel on a bad weekend nice modern and up to date rooms good location small but convenient gym there was no hot water the air conditioning in the room didn t work so it was very warm wich made sleeping difficult there was a long queue for breakfast about a   min wait to get in simply because the breakfast staff weren t re laying empty tables quickly enough the restaurant was no more than     full and had more than enough empty tables to seat the people queuing there was still a queue when we finished breakfast and by that point the room was about   full there were a few staff who were wandering around doing nothing until unless somebody else told them to do something we arrived at breakfast around   minutes before it stopped by this point there were no fried eggs no mushrooms and no toast that seems inexcusable how can you run out of bread unless your planning is terrible the reception staff were good and the rooms are nice the bed was comfortable we were given a partial   refund without quibble as a result of the things we didn t like just wish i could ve stayed longer i was amazed to find this cheap   hotel in central london that was a holiday inn more like luxury holiday inn wow great hotel and the most comfortable bed i ve stayed in for a long time no negative the room was clean and well presented the water was only warm in the shower not hot and there was a queue at breakfast which i m not sure why nothing to like the hotel is in major renovations with drilling starting as early as   am the bar and rest if you could call them that are a disgrace no carpet on the stairs its cold and absolutely filthy the rooms are a disgrace dirty bathroom floors stained linen on the bed as for the noise you may as well forget about sleeping due to drilling one lift worked for the two days which stopped at every floor regardless of requests hence it took   minutes to get to your room you know a hotel with   s of rooms with one lift and no access to stairs is beyond frustrating id also think illegal in regards to safety if a fire started you d have no way out and when you mention the problems to front of house they smile and shrug seriously what type of reply is that lastly i ve stayed in most brand hotels in london due to the fact i fly there bi weekly as a rule i book direct if you re going to take a percentage of bookings you should at least offer hotels that function as such will i use you again doubtful will i stay at that the holiday in nope never as it stands that hotel should not be suggesting its full service considering its a a work site pretending to be a full service hotel regards kieran will be better when all work is finished good location for west end theatres being refurbished and we had rooms on first floor and these had been refurbished they were very nicely decorated good bathroom facilities breakfast was good with usual choice of cooked and cereal plenty on offer we would book again it s a little sketchy from the hotel to kings cross great tv channels and bed was definitely soft as a cloud bathroom was very nice too and shower pressure was top notch the main elevator was not working so plenty of times we had to go up to the  th floor using the stairs recently refurbished room clean comfortable bed water and drink in fridge i booked for one double bed they placed me in room with two single beds stuff have become less friendly and don t respond to questions satisfactorily the wifi signal was intermittent but we just found comfy seats in the basement lobby where it was stronger there we could plan our day so it really wasn t an issue the reception staff were particularly helpful the rooms were extremely clean and well equipped the beds were very comfy we enjoyed the breakfast very much late night major electrical fault in several rooms on my floor causing blue flames loud crackling noise at the wall socket in use and wrecking my device charger night staff were helpful in changing my room but i didn t feel safe and got very little sleep refund for the cost of a replacement charger the following morning was grudging newly refurbished rooms quiet the room hot as the air con is weak and wimpy i ve stayed here quite a number of times the hotel is presently in an upgrade process so there is some disruption at present despite this the staff are helpful and attentive as usual the place is spotless you would hardly know the builders are in and the new rooms are very nice i am sure the long term result will be great the bed was very comfortable and the room well lit not dark and dull like so many places with mood lighting bad mood the hotel is in a relatively quiet site and there is little internal noise but it is about   mins walk to any underground station the noise all night was a joke i stayed with a   year and   year old the night before disney they never got sleep with the noise at   we gave up and got dressed and showered hotel to nice staff was polite the hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work the pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed the lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only   of the   went to all floor which meant getting from the lobby to the room could take   minutes the fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night the room was comfortable and recently modernised the hot tub was good and the pool was ok standard so much lower than a   croissants were cheap imitations place was being renovated alarm system went off   times between  am and  am my   star room had an adjoining door with an inch gap st the bottom i could hear our neighbours every words wifi crap and cleaners didn t service room properly rubbish was not cleared bed wasn t made properly nothing the queues to get in the breakfast room were large once in there we had to queue again for hot food by the time we had waited for toast and eggs the rest of the food was cold more kitchen staff neededno positive the only very slight issue was no room information left in my room but was ther within   minsbof reporting it awesome the staff their best asset from umar reception manager to the housekeeping staff especially the hear of the bar downstairs and the room service guys the amount of sockets etc was a bonus too would definitely recommend and will be using again asap thank you heidi roper breakfast was quite stressful due to the long lines waiting i understand that this was due to the refurbishment and we were pre warned the pool and friendliness of the staff bed was small bathroom flooded from shower woken up at     by hoovering and drilling and banging staff were rude in terms of didn t tell us anything like where the lifts were or when check out was no book in room to tell us information room looked fantastic very nice decor complimentary toothbrush and comb was nice checked in with family around    pm given room keys for a  st floor room upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where i was first advised that i had not booked family room upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on  th floor upon moving from the  st floor to the  th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up the whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx  mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids after all this turned on the tv and the remote control didn t work at this point gave up and went to sleep p s you have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool no positive perhaps bigger lifts but not an issue at all the hotel had recently been refurbished to a high standard i think they are still due to work on the restaurant the bedroom and en suite was amazing bed very comfy and extremely clean no info on website regarding building work luckily not at hotel during day but if i had i would have been annoyed distance to nearest tube station was about a mile too far time in london is too precious fab upgraded room good varied breakfast pleasant and helpful staff as there was renovations which didn t bother us the water supply got cut off a few times which i would have liked warning with a phone call from reception to inform us and give us a time frame about it loved the curtains as it made the room extra dark clean and a good size not enough lifts to hot in corridors no mirror for hair drier bath very difficult to get in and out of especially out of nothing to hold onto television reception very poor no long length mirror comfortable room lots of space nice decor basement not refurbished yet but if it matches the rest of the building it will be great signage to find the bar and other facilities was hard to find staff were extremely friendly and helpful in terms of directions and so forth the complimentary i newspaper was a nice touch too the building was still to be completed following an obvious refurb the lifts were extremely slow waited almost   minutes before taking the stairs which were clearly being used to move tools and materials and therefor looked like a tradesmans stairwell room was very pleasant clean modern well equipped the layout of the breakfast was a bit strange cereals would have been better with the fruit and cheese instead of next to the hot food comfortable bed  nothing not cheap but i expect this is a standard price in central london the room and bed were comfortable and the bathroom clean and well appointed i arrived went to bed and left early the next morning i had no breakfast so cannot comment on the food   minutes walk from king s cross i arrived very late in the evening and had a very early start and the check in staff were extremely slow despite no other customer being around the floor was a no smoking floor but the whole floor and corridor stank of cigarette smoke the location is shocking kings cross i may as well call any wherein the m  near kings cross this hotel is situated in a dodgy poorly lit area not that near to the station as a female sole traveller it felt very unsafe the room was clean work still being done in the hotel and inadequacy of temporary signage makes it difficult to find your way around this isn t helped by every corridor on every floor being decorated identically like being trapped in a maze newly refurbished room was cosy but comfortable staff extremely friendly and helpful breakfast was freshly cooked and there was plenty of choice everything about the stay was perfect we had a great time here the perfect overnight stay for me and a friend very comfortable bed and the staff were all very helpful and professional the breakfast was nice but i did have a slight stomach upset afterwards nothing too bad though the room was immaculate the cleaners obviously take their work very seriously which is nice due to ongoing improvements to hotel the breakfast dining room was moved to a smaller room on our second day and the breakfast was cold friendly staff very nice room renovations going on so could be a little noisy at times room was of high quality and bed was very comfortable location was good for visiting the tourist sites of inner london hotel under renovation noisy building works reception area drab and unwelcoming bedroom recently renovated staff tried to hard to get us into room early the hotel was lovely the weather however was not we were in london for a friends wedding the bed was very comfy and the room was very nice for the price the bathroom was very modern and clean i d definitely recommend restaurant food terrible hotel undergoing renovations the lifts were rubbish we waited for   lifts going up and down and ended up using the goods lift to get down locationno negative nothing didn t even bother to check with all the arguments and hassle at the reception decided that a hotels reception is meant to be welcoming and not what l witnessed asked for my money back hotel manager said no he checked with his staff and they told them there was no problems that day well they were going to say that shame as l will not stay in their hotels ever again and l will share extensively this experience in my business as how not to create a world class customer service the location did not feel safe i walked alone to kings cross station during the afternoon and was hassled twice by   different men the renovations do not compensate for the poor location i was in a new refurbished room which had been done very well there was no fan in the bathroom the location and the room was beautiful breakfast was always good it was close to kings cross station which made getting the tubes very easy lots of places to enjoy meals and only   minutes or so on the tube to the london eye not very convenient for either king s cross or russel square underground stations spacious room with an area for reading laying out maps guide books etc no problems with traffic noise had evening meal a couple of times in the hotel and although the food was good it took ages to arrive   minutes and i was simply told the kitchen is too busy with room service need chairs to sit at the desk in the room to be more business friendly the concierge needs to smile more newly renovated rooms are nice airy and fresh bathroom and shower were great good food in hotel restaurant very small rooms we had a superior room so i cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms not so close from kings cross about   min walk tv not working staff did not repair it over   days but they offered us a discount on the room fair enough surely the refurbished rooms are modern and tastefully decorated room was really hot air con does not cool just recirc air and window cannot be opened complained and where moved new room was exact same overall a pretty good hotel staff where great the room was cold but the staff provided a heater so okay would have liked a bathtub but the wet room was an excellent standard with a superb shower the food was a good standard though not exciting excellent bed loved the swimming pool and jacuzzi and friendly staff good location and value for money on the deal i got wouldn t have wanted to pay full price though for the standard room had   double beds and a nice working desk but made for cramped space wifi wasn t great in my room good standard of newly refurbished rooms and a good value for money in central london our initial allocation of a room on the  nd floor this floor has yet to be renovated and was a smoking floor we complained and were immediately relocated to level   which was terrific the room had been recently completely refurbished it was really nice the toilet malfunctioned on the last day reported to reception and they promised to sort it out it was not anyone s making but it was frustrating a bit clean facilities restauant menu was a bit boring the construction work on the hotel refurbishment was inconvenient close and convenient to kings cross station and the eurostar terminal with the   bus pick up at the door direct to the station well obviously the renovations in the restaurant were a problem no real air conditioning on the hottest day of the year but efficient room service extremely comfortable bed and good air conditioning the room service breakfast was good too and i would use the hotel again no hot water in morning soundproofing between us and next room was a locked partition door we could hear their conversations and other noises no positive the lifts in the building were very inefficient due to renovations taking place some time had to use the emergency stair well to get to the ground floor pool and spa facility were great bed was comfortable nothing perfect stay very luxurious and modern facilities beds were huge and the whole room was spotless rain shower was amazing and the price for the location was unbeatable the construction noise from the hotel remodelling convenient to kings cross station a good stop over when using the eurostar train service a   bus stops just outside the hotel and delivers you the main entrance of the station it was a busy and crowded bank holiday weekend and there were real issues with only one lift seemingly in operation and an   floor building the lovely view from the  th floor room of an area of london i know well but not from that perspective there could have been a better choice of pastries for breakfast the cheese and ham were poor quality and unapoealing and cold croissants are awful more lifts needed and pool dominated by children till after     no positive breakfast terrible for the price no choice more of a canteen look to it room in need off refurbishment hotel in need off refurbishment tiles falling lifts not working use stair most times my bathroom smelled strongly of urine staff we hospitable no negative the room was nice and clean with good facilities we were up on the  th floor so no noise from any traffic heard bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom was spotless location too far from bus routes shopping and theatres i e not handy all hotel facilities used were excellent wide choice for breakfast staff courteous and helpful having read the advertisement for the hotel and drawn by the presence of a pool and a gym i thought the hotel very good value for money however i was disappointed that those facilities required separate payment and so have revised my opinion somewhat no positive location was a bit far from underground station and the construction was noisy in the day the hotel is currently converting to a different brand from holiday inn and construction was going on although they did warn me of this in advance   minute walk to the kings cross area and st pancras train station too soon to give a true evaluation staff was great during our   night stay the fire alarm went off   times in the middle of the night once in our first night and twice in the last the noise was deafening and sleepy people in night clothes came out to the corridor to see if there is a fire nobody even apologized for false alarms and poor sleep quality when we checked out although nearly each suitcase comes with a producer s warning that it should not be lifted by using the pull handle the luggage storage guy lifted the suitcases only that way and was really arrogant when i asked him not to two functioning elevators were far too few for a hotel of that size staying on the  th floor we experienced it every morning that the elevator that was heading down to the ground floor was already too full when it reached our floor having started from the  th by the  th floor at the latest it was impossible to enter the elevator so make sure to ask for a room on the highest floor we could not find the stairs to use them instead no idea how we would have found our way out if there indeed would have been a fire the room was clean modern and nicely decorated and truly spacious for london standards towels changed daily good bed and comfy bedding two different pillows to choose between there was even one c e f type socket as used in the rest of europe in the room the location of the hotel is also pretty good although the nearest underground station king s cross is     km away no dislikes was allocated one of the refurbished rooms and it was lovely breakfast also very good with a variety of fresh food to suit every taste very enjoyable stay here and although refurbishment in progress this had no effect whatsoever on our stay having major improvements but for   for   nights i didn t expect to be woken at    am to the sound of drilling under our window noise was terrible went to spa at  pm the pool was full of kids so couldn t use it and a man was sat on side of hot tub in wet boxers exposing himself final night decided to eat in restaurant asked for steak medium rare which came back twice medium to well done for   you expect what you paid for so we went to pub across the road which was excellent we were given a discount of   per night at such high prices i will not be staying there again friendly staff the dining room was really small and very littleroom to move felt like every inch of space was a table so couldn t walk around easily the first day we ended up in a small alternative room the toast was cooked and brought down so was cold lovely comfortable rooms and a nice hotel drilling     mornings before  am one other day woke up by workmen wifi was unusable from the room was told i needed to walk   minutes to get something to eat when we got back from a night out no night porter or food services at all pool gym only available to residents at     per person per visit lovely clean room and very modern bathroom the construction works woke me up at  am i phoned to reception several times and the problem was not resolved this was stressful and not what i had hoped for no positive the bedrooms were really tight to fit into the breakie was good food but quite chaotic and too busy to relax the two lifts were also soooo slow in one of our rooms the air con broke so we had to move rooms also the other room the bathtub blocked we like the modern feel in the bedroom it was also close to kings cross stno negative room beds breakfast staff all wonderful close to st pancras station eurostar to paris belgium easily accessible great restaurants in the area pool great experience staff arguing with each other in restaurant building work shower floods bathroom location to tube station and anything else cost per night considering above nothing stands out system was down both in the evening and morning no real apology and even the chains twitter account fobbed us off think i ll be heading back to my usual hotel in london staff were very apologetic for system being down and queuing at check in even at     wifi didn t work well the pay tv didn t work and i could not receive a bill at the end of my stay the room was comfortable clean and the staff was friendly strange   steps down to elevators was a mild drag for hauling luggage this was the absolutely worst thing exceptionally accommodating staff allowing early occupancy following an airbnb relocation they also allowed a hassle free bag holding while we did one last explore of london before our evening plane left btw people in hotel bar had been to stevie wonder concert that very evening took   requests to get the sofa bed made into a sofa even having booked it however the receptionist was very good the shower was good the hotel was clean and friendly and modern only a service lift for people with limited mobility which was not working on the day we left there was a pool available but you had to pay extra to use it which was not made clear on the website breakfast was very good value for money the breakfast staff were excellent what i didn t grasp when booking was that when they said refurbishments were going on that meant a jack hammer on the floor beneath us at  am the restaurant had gigantic ac units in the dining room i m sure it will be beautiful in due time and we got a good price due to the construction i suppose but it was not entirely done and the poor staff seemed harried the rooms are clean it s well run if you pay a fee there is a lovely pool some areas were under renovation around us noise was not an issue however having to reroute patrons to an entrance to the elevator requiring the use of steps with luggage was a real pain close to bus line but about   min or more to closest tube wifi did not work very well from our room rooms were newly renovated staff was mostly helpful staff were very cold and too formal just prepared to do the bare minimum i was surprised by the cold attitude the manager in charge has to be sent for hospitality training so that he can in turn teach and hire people who are hospitable and suited for the industry this was very different from all the previous holiday inn hotels i have stayed before what a waste great resources put to waste by unhospitable attitude of employees retraining on customer service and pr is an absolute necessity clean comfortable rooms nice shower facilities nice bed hotel is under construction and disturbing noises start in the early morning free wifi but it disconnects every   minutes location is not the best place to stay poor breakfast far too expensive for what you get nothing wifi was really bad in the room and the whole place was being renovated so there was really loud noise all day this renovation was not mentioned while booking and the price was still very high despite this renovation i felt completely cheated no positive the nearest tube station kings cross is at least   min walk away the smoke alarm rang shrilly without any reason thrice on our first of three nights effectively spoiling the night s sleep room had   comfortable double beds bathroom was clean and spacious fridge with complimentary goodies was a nice touch it was quite difficult to hail a taxi in the morning the room was clean and comfortable and quite adequate for our one night stay before catching eurostar from st pancras noisy hotel under reconstruction relatively far from king s cross station mold in the bathroom we were awakened by the sound of the drill around   a m i would definetely not recommend this hotel no positive view from room building works this was probably why the cost was so reasonable bed comfy newly refurbished room very reasonably priced for central london housekeepers too keen and should check reception for who has checked out knocked and walked straight in twice when i was in bed newly refurbished room was lovely friendly efficient reception breakfast not out of world but perfectly acceptable location was a  min walk from nearest tube and walking back in the evening through fairly quiet streets was a little intimidating the new rooms were lovely very comfortable and great selection at breakfast when we booked we specifically requested on site parking was told   for overnight stay when we arrived car park was posed and had been since january so we had to wks to another car park and paid   more poor service from booking com we had to report that bedtime had long black hairs on it tea cups and saucers were filthy whole stay felt like we had been cheated out of our money wouldn t stay againno positive the hotel was undergoing refurbishment works so was noisy in working hours but acknowledge this is unavoidable the room was a good size with sofa and it was clean and comfortable the breakfast buffet which was included in the room rate offered lots of choice including cooked or fruit cereal etc nothing really nearest tube kings cross   mn walk just marginally too far especially if you ve mobility issues refurbishment not yet fully completed but seems most floors now done stayed in newly refurbished rooms excellent breakfast a little disappointing hot food was lovely but very limited fresh fruit no berries pastries very dry and again very poor selection was not offered toast unable to toast bread ourselves room nice and spacious big bed comfortable and very clean there was lot of construction noise as renovation on few floors were going on the rate is too high compared to what they offer not worth the price we paid the bed was comfy staff were not very pleasant they seemed to do there job with efficiency but with little customer service motivation a friendly smile along with a genuineness wouldn t go a miss for purpose of my business in london it was nearby it was clean and nicely decorated no parking due to refurb outside of the building would benefit a clean in upper regions to reflect the clean inside but i expect this is in the pipeline after work is completed lovely new refurbished rooms very clean and warm and quiet very friendly staff good location thick yoghurt please the fact that the room we stayed in had been refurbished to a good standard bed very comfortable ten minutes walk from kings cross all staff very cheerful if i have to maker a comment um the lifts get a bit busy in the morning and staying on the  th floor i was to lazy to use the stairs but otherwise nothing great room good break fast friendly staff felt very relaxed refurbishment in progress so only   lifts working for the whole hotel and no food available after  pm not even bar snacks good room which had just been refurbished refurbishment in progress only one of the two elevators would stop at our floor going upstairs downstairs was a nightmare room was quite small the location is good bus   brings you basically anywhere the bed was extremely comfortable the guy in the restaurant area wasn t very attentive i had to track him down to get a refill of water it s close to st pancras international kings cross station so quite easy to get about town it s clean and comfortable no negative pillows not comfy had a sofa bed which i was told when we checked in that it would be made up later we arrived back at the hotel to find it not made spoke to reception was told someone would be there in   mins that didn t happen second call made to reception to be told that it could be   mins but couldn t really give me a definable time finally some arrived half an hour after bringing it to there attention this is the last thing i wanted after a long day and all my son wanted to do is go to bed other than that breakfast was very nice reception staff could be more friendly and informative there was a english man by the luggage who was very friendly and helpful they did not solve my wifi issues but instead ran me in circles with various excuses that were inconsistent some would say it s out of service other would say there are dark spots in hotel one tried to help for   second and gave up they seemed understaffed and willing to give random answers without trying to help i was there for business and won t return also non dairy breakfast options were inadequate not much stop the bloody constant alarm going off and oh my god let the potential customers know that there is construction happening at the hotel cant believe all the above compared to the expensive price at the same time diagraceful wifi as my  g network would be far better than their silly snail like wifi disgraceful for them to also charge to use the swimming pool     rating shower and bed the fire alarm went off at   am then noisy renovation going on in the morning but we weren t there to sleep breakfast was excellent we had an unfurnished room but it was in great condition staff friendly very disappointed to find no tea and coffee facilities in the room plus there were builders drilling in the room next door on a sunday morning which caused disturbance to our sleep luxurious bed excellent quality furnishings beautiful bathroom great location wasn t happy with the internet wifi signal very frustratingly kept disconnectin and the tv was difficult to use regarding your films opinion tried to press menu just didn t bother in the end however it s not like i d not stay again i did think was a very nice helpful staff i did like how pleasant and helpful the staff where right from booking in to booking out they tried hard to overcome my problems as much as they could the place is under construction so was woken in the morning and couldn t sleep in the day there should have been a discount the location was great breakfast was great wifi is poor and you get kick out all the time so you have to put in the id and password again which is not friendly wifi is probabely the top on the necessity list having to keeping in the id and password is really pain very comfortable beds hotel is be renovated at the moment and we got new rooms is nice when you get to use new things and room location of the hotel is a distant to kings cross underground but take the bus   the frequency is good hotel staff should recommend option to take bus or walk which is   minutes walk the extremely slow wifi and the   device only limitation there should be a shower door as well to keep water from splashing to the toilet the refurnished room was great the bed was comfortable the airconditioning actually works as hotel aircons are not very functionable noisy neighbours at a ridiculous hour but was very well handled by staff thin walls loved that everything was as expected comfy everything great view of the sunset from window only issue was the noise was horrendous a lot worse than expected and very early in the morning all weekend staff were amazing tom and so helpful room was nice and bed comfy we know the hotel was being refurbished and from the comments on booking com and so we were expecting to stay in a refurbished room besides this we asked on the reservation for a room in the upper floors they gave us room   an old room where you can see dust everywhere and lots of faulty things you can also hear everything in the corridors and rooms nearby from people walking talking and having a shower it s definitely far from being a   hotel when i complained about not having a refurbished room at the checkout the only thing i was told was you should have asked full english breakfast with plenty of choice good location considering the price if you have the oyster card or a travelcard you can easily get the bus number   to king s cross station and from there access any zone of london the concierge was very helpful and nice the construction was unpleasant and the un upgraded portions were lacking staff not particularly empathetic to the effect of the construction on their guests it s not as close to kings cross station as i thought the name is a bit deceiving the upgraded rooms were nice shows the potential noise from outside and inside acoustic is not so good gym to be paid extra hotel newly refurbished spacious room very pleasant and functional desk properly adapted to work good breakfast we were unaware there was an extra charge for the pool as we were looking forward to a swim after a day of sight seeing the staff were pleasant there was a very good breakfast and the room was very comfortable we were placed in a smoking room on arrival despite our booking specifically stating that we had booked a non smoking room this room was disgusting dingy and it reeked of stale smoke staff told us the hotel was fully booked and so we were unable to be moved that night we were also woken up by drilling at  am after the smoking room fiasco the manager was quick to change our room the next day nothing the staff were so polite checked into our room early which was brilliant beds were very comfortable and the food smelt delicious also had a free leave your luggage service couldn t fault the hotel at all can t wait to go back we would have liked some information for tourists with a list of top rated restaurants in the area local travel services how to get to the main london attractions and local knowledge no services such as preloaded travel cards and a map of the area were offered luckily we had our smartphones with us otherwise it would have been difficult to navigate where we wanted to go staff were extremely helpful we booked a superior room for our anniversary and it was so quiet and nicely decorated with some nice touches breakfast was included in our price and it was well cooked and warm don t stay if looking for space gorgeous new refurbishment however very annoying during stay smaller than expected quite cramped overall feeling to the hotel didn t consider it value for money   pp didn t even include breakfast had to pay extra for a swim which i wasn t aware of until i arrived unfortunately on arrival internet didn t work and neither did tv comfortable bed and lovely and clean the staff were not good with english very surprising given we were in the uk the breakfast was poor the lifts inadequate for the size of the hotel the room was modern and clean horrendous noise from building works aware that improvements were being made to some bedrooms but not informed of the sheer scale of noise coming from the extensive refurbishment of the reception area we couldn t get away from the noise both in our room and in the spa disappointed a charge now applies for the leisure facilities staff unable to help at times had to ask   members of staff the same question and none of them understood english location and facilities on  st impression they claimed on there website that this was a     min walk this is completely incorrect we walked for approxamitly   mins from kings cross breakfast was great the car park had been closed for building work meaning that we had no where to park the car i was not informed of this prior to our stay and this was one of the main reasons why we booked this hotel the receptionist brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to park in an ncp car park costing us   extra in parking fees was not happy with this service at allno positive breakfest room is hot and old style breakfest menu is simple elevators are slow and not sufficiant for such a big hotel maybe because of ongoing reconstruction refurbished modern room nothing spacious room very comfortable bed and pillows were just right made for welcome sleep well stocked bathroom toiletries very strong wifi signal whole time i was there self service english breakfast which you just helped yourself welcome benefit to go back for more i got to breakfast late and staff were starting to clear away but i did get my meal and staff encouraged me to help myself to more food there is a small car park at front entrance about a dozen or so cars so if anyone needs to park a car i suppose you need to contact reception to reserve a space although i didn t need it just thought i d mention it for others building work meant that the common areas of hotel are limited and cramped breakfast was not great dining room lacks comfort or style although newly refurbished room felt too small reception staff were great room was newly refurbished the hotel is a bit hard to reach it s   minutes walking to st pancras kings cross it s not a super pleasant walk i must say our room was very big and confortable you couldn t hear any noise which is very remarkable for london the spa jacuzzi too powerful and steam room burning hot lounge area was poor the beds and pillows were comfy the staff were helpful and friendly room was clean very poor overall for money spent drilling started first thing in the morning room very expensive and dumped into non refurbished area lifts complete nightmare spent   minutes trying to get lift to ground floor not impressed at all barely adequate room at ridiculously expensive price the bedrooms that have not been refurbished yet shouldn t be used as not up to standard or offer them at lower price very disappointed location not the cleanest of hotels and lots of building works going on making it very noisy in the day the spa facility s charge also good sized room and bathroom but the windows do not open in the smoking rooms making it very stuffy air conditioning was adequate but would have liked if the window opened for some fresh air lock on bathroom was faulty but should be easily fixed by the maintenance dept great room quiet good view on  th floor great staff sho were ever present and ever helpful wifi didnt work very well but other than that no complaints great location rooms were of a very high standard not what i was expecting for a holiday inn definitely will come again we stayed in room   wifi wasn t good at all it never worked the design of the bath made it difficult to get in and out plus the water never went that warm the tv had a very limited amount of channels compared to other hotels we have stayed the room was very nice and had a comfy bed there was construction work outside but no problems couldn t hear anything in the mornings stayed two nights in this hotel and can not recommend it enough will definitely be coming back for another stay here the rooms were fantastic very clean and modern provided safe in the room television and free wifi i stayed on the fifth floor wifi was free was giving a token and no problems only  min walk from the underground kings cross station and international railway staff were very friendly and helpful area is very safe for a large luxury hotel very tight with their complimentary items had a double room with   bottle of still and   bottle of sparkling water   kitkat and   packet of biscuits containing   biscuits with the coffee tea location brilliant for the o  islington very quiet area but close to the center of london if you were here a whileno negative spa and pool area is very nice even though it is not included in hotel price and room was very clean bed was also comfy overall a very pleasant stay the car park was advertised as open it was closed they did not advertise that you had to pay for the gym i have never heard of that before in a hotel the lifts did not work and they did not put up a sign saying so we were put on the smoking floor they serve terrible wine at the bar the place is under refurbishment and needs it the whole place needs it nothing really building operations and lack of signage outside the hotel indicating the entrance made access a guess very firm but comfortable bed large room with sofa it is implied that the gym is included in the price it isn t and you have to pay     the gym equipment is dated and doesn t justify this extra expense there is also work going on at the hotel at the moment lovely clean and spacious roomno negative bed very comfortable room quiet and peaceful restaurant staff efficient and welcoming they were doing their very busy job well whilst maintaining a calm unhurried atmosphere in the breakfast room well done there was an air of quiet respect no clattering of crockery etc the staff clearly take a pride in their work although there is air conditioning in the room the windows are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air in the room a definite negative point for me the staff were friendly and helpful the room very quiet with adequate facilities booked the hotel solely on the strength that there was parking and a punch bag in the gym arrived at the hotel to find there was neither parking was unavailable due to refurbishment forcing us to use a ncp car park down the road for   per night punch bag had been taken down ages ago according to member of staff on the gym desk although still showed it being up in the hotel pics rooms where pretty nicely furnished this is my threatment upon attemting to checking in unfortunatley you booked through booking com unfortunatley you havent paid yet unfortunatley your room is not ready yet     and i had advised at booking stage unfortunatley your card is not authorized on checking in something went wronh with my card i asked were was the nearest atm and i withdrew the ammount from the same card and the same card worked fine everywhere else no attempt from the lady to try it out again at this point i was already feeling pretty unfortunate wifi was barley at my room     signal bar there are refurbishing underway and i would have loved to know if i was aware at booking stage the concierge on the otherhand were sublime in fact thats the only reason i scored better the service welldone to the concierge clean spacious little bit of nose due to the refurbishment but nothing we couldn t handle the rooms was newly refurbished and very clean it was absolutely fine for our over night stay i booked with your hotel as it was meant to have a bath and on arriving it never had one do i was very dissapointed also i put the label on my door saying do not disturb but still room service knocked  times aldo building was going on on it was extremely noisy i till report it but was told nothing could be done it was clean the hotel is under going renovations you can hear the drilling the location is not ideal nearest tube station is   min walk the staff and the concierge were not not helping at all not we had to handle our bags out and in a stared entrance and when complained about the drilling the simply asked us to leave instead of offering some kind of compensation the rooms are new clean and spacious by london standards wifi should be complimentary i liked the location of the hotel in relation to king s cross station the staff at the hotel were friendly very helpful and very efficient particularly with regard to our dietary request for soya milk for breakfast i would recommend and plan on staying at this hotel in the near future the size of the room was disappointing especially as ours was a supposedly superior room once the travel cot had been installed we could hardly move also storage was an issue both these issues made having the buggy in the room very difficult location good and rooms clean and in good state of repair the female reception staff english speaking levels weren t great had to get them to repeat questions on a few occasions walls were obviously very thin because we had the room next door complain that we were laughing to loudly at  pm however come  am the next morning their baby woke us up with its crying double edged sword really hotel isnt a close walk to a tube station nor is it located with any real tourist points of interest i personally dont care about that as im a londoner but i do feel its location is abit of a pain because you have to get a bus to the nearest tube if your not a fan of rain or walking the room was very clean and modern lovely bathroom sofa and double bed decent sized tv and good blacked out curtains bar area needs an upgrade rooms recently refurbished smart modern comfy at the price we paid value for money not sure if the special rate will always be available hotel being totally re furbished no noise during evening times we didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website which we hadn t used to book they also said work was happening     but on the second day we were woken before    am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook on the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery it was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round the shower was nice bed was very soft my personal preference is very hard broken window latch so room got cold overnight faulty power outlet and wifi had a weak signal it only worked when i stood by the door plenty of pillows well decorated room and good sized bath easy check in and staff were keen to offer a partial refund due to the issues i had when i notified in the morning work been carried out at hotel which i was aware but not the fact car park will be closed also should have been clearer prior to booking closest car park   mins walk not great about  am in the morning with rain hotel car park is very small not many parking spaces good location heart of central london close approximity of to do things in london the hotel is about a mile from the nearest tube at kings cross station which is not made clear on the website walking in the evening from the tube station along kings cross road was not very pleasant comfortable and spacious room lovely bathroom building work going on to refurbish the hotel but stops around   o clock this hotel is excellent i stay at a lot of hotels in london and this is value for money refurbished to a high standard tv broke minor disruption caused by ongoing refurbishment no complimentary tea coffee water provided comfy room newly refurbished good food friendly competent service good value no negative i had a refurbished room and it was perfect i got room service everyone was amazingly friendly the best hotel service i ve had very good value for money the food was lush the room was very clean and comfortable and modern and even though there was works happening in the hotel there was very little disruption the car park was closed no information given at time of booking rude ignorant unhelpful staff told me to go to another hotel that was their only offer of help i will never use this chain of hotels again no positive dissapointed we weren t told about renovations in progress and the car park being closed during the renovations nice clean comfortable rooms modern bathrooms with good shower hotel parking is closed due to refurbishment so had to park in the ncp which was expensive also a shame there isn t a tube station closer by but that s hardly something te hotel can control not a bad price and the steam room in the leisure centre was a decent temperature also one of the things we like about the location was discovering the nearby village with very good restaurants reception bar and restaurant area are all being refurbished later this year which will bring them up to the standard of the rest of the refurbed rooms the newly refurbished bedroom and shower room were great very comfy bed spacious room excellent shower would definitely stay here again great to have the spa facilities difficult to get a cab despite only a short walk to the stations it was raining clearly not the hotels fault though really helpful friendly staff and ongoing refurb had no impact on stay short walk to faringdon or king s cross stations the  th floor has a constant hum it would be useful if reception staff informed guests of that when they arrive i had to be moved at  am as i struggled to sleep staff very helpful room of high quality the first room was not what had been booked it was also on a smoking corridor although the room was non smoking opening the door on to the corridor was horrid the smell of smoke was pervasive i also thought the bathroom was tired grouting stained and unpleasant the staff were very helpful and friendly responding quickly to the request to move rooms the second room was great clean comfortable and roomy also the corridor smelt fragrant throughout the stay the staff were helpful giving advise where to park and looking after the bags after we checked out breakfast was a feast fresh wide choice and relaxed atmosphere not in the best location due to distances to tubes or kings cross but only a short walk or quick taxi ride   very comfortable newly refurbed room on the  th floor very friendly staff n a very accommodating and friendly staff who went the extra mile to make sure my needs were met offered advice for around london and extended my stay when required beautiful clean modern room with excellent facilities you d be hard pushed to find a hotel this quality at this price anywhere else in london and i ve stayed in a few the hotel bar staf were not very friendly the larger was flat and not cold and when we complained we were not understood and were given the same flat drink the pool was smaller than we thought and busy the bed was comfortable the service from reception was very good the room was very clean we couldn t use the pool on both mornings because it was full apparently they only allow max of   ppl and they charge you to use the facilities even as a hotel guest when we checked in they assigned us the old room which was outdated and the bed was worn down i literally felt veryigo just lying on the bed worst of all they gave us a room right below the renovation work so there were loud bangings drilling and sanding in the morning my  month old woke up in a startle from the banging and sicked my husband was fuming because the staff at reception wasnt very helpful until he demanded to speak to the manager who moved us to a higher floor to the newly renovated room no positive it was an excellent place to stay no negatives very warm welcome clean and comfortable rooms close to kings cross and euston stations i would recommend this hotel on arrival i was given a room card three times i had to return to reception as the cards would not open the door on the occasion prior to my third visit to reception i had telephoned from the corridor telephone and was informed a concierge would meet me at my room with a new card to open my room door i waited almost   minutes for this to happen and then decided to return to reception where my room card was again exchanged and i was escorted to my room to ensure the card worked which it did at no point through this   minute experience was an apology given for the frustration the hotel bar also looked tired and the bar tender obviously wasn t aware he could keep the surface free from spilt drinks or polish the wood to reduce its stickyness my colleague that booked the day prior also gained a better rate for his room by   i use holiday as often as possible and usually have a very easy care free stay this occasion could have been better location the staff have no customer service skills was put in a smoking room when asked to be placed in a non smoking we asked to be moved and was sent to the second floor where someone was bringing up the keys waited for   mins in gowns outside the room the resraunt was closed and was unable to eat i strongly urge you not to go to this establishment and i won t be using the company again wasn t able to even enjoy the spa facilities which was the only thing that looked half decent also get a room on the  th floor up anything below that is getting refurbished or the very basic room where they put me and my partner along with a few other couples who all booked on booking com wasn t as close to kings cross as you think     min walk depending how fast you walk beds were comfortable and the leisure facilities looked good but didn t use and didn t use restaurant so can t comment very rude member of staff at breakfast firstly it was noticeable that those who had breakfast included in their stay were shunted off to a side room which was far dingier than the dining room used for those who were paying extra for breakfast on asking a member of staff for some butter having been unable to find some on the buffet she rudely grunted that it is on the buffet and walked away the sauna facility in the spa was in poor repair especially considering the additional fee for use despite these minor grumbles the hotel offered great value for money and i would stay again the room had recently been refurbished and was in excellent repair we also arrived to complimentary soft drinks and a snack in the mini fridge which was lovely the value was fantastic with breakfast included refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance there was renovation on some floors but overall no impact for me to the stay during this visit as a new room was allocated from onset newly refurbished rooms were great hotel staff was excellent and very accommodating once renovations are finished it will be an excellent hotel for business travelers refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance substantial renovation on floors and lobby meant that as a business traveler it was not a hassle free stay hotel management changed me to a new room   day after arrival which was great but booking com should have notified of this situation upon booking this hotel newly refurbished rooms were great hotel staff was excellent and very accommodating once renovations are finished it will be an excellent hotel for business travelers i didn t find the staff helpful at all i hadn t been in that area before and asked a few staff for advice on where to go for eating and shopping there response was short and not very pleasant breakfast was included in our stay but was cold and not tasty at all the hotel room was clean and spacious good location for the work i was over for but not central if i was there for a leisure break hotel staffs were not trained at all the receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name holiday inn i called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before i finished talking i just could not believe it also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when i booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around i made a complain when i checked in but the receptionist accused me i was wrong that i did not check holiday inn website that was very very rude of her saying and i was pretty upset if people book through booking com or expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance i was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect if you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you they are in london but they do not have mentality as british i recommend not to chose this hotel if you expect excellent service from famous brand name absolutely none the car park was closed as refurbishment going on this wasn t advertised at time of booking and car parking at an extra charge was a main reason for choosing this hotel we were disappointed on arrival to find no parking available had to park a   minute walk away clean and comfy with a good breakfast choice the beds sounds like you are sleeping in a carrier bag due to this one thing i slept only   hour the whole night the shower also naturally floods the bathroom making it unpleasant for the next person to take a shower when you share only one bathrobe for   people only   floor towel for   people plus floor towel useless due to extreme flooding in the bathroom it was a very clean environment with very friendly and helpful staff i walked to to hotel and although it s about   mins walk from kings cross station but i didn t realise its on a bus route with frequent buses to kings cross although hotel isn t near any tube stations its easy to get to kings cross for tube etc i stayed in newly refurbished  th floor room which was excellently finished new bed decor furniture and bathroom aswell as great view of city very comfortable bed and pillows great wifi signal in room too i had dinner at night in restaurant and very tasty food helpful staff and even better they also have separate concierge desk who ll give you lots of information about anything you need to know frequent buses to kings cross pass hotel and into city just a short few minute walk away from hotel is rosebery avenue where several buses go to city no negative staff polite friendly and very helpful all went out of their way to help me with all my queries room clean comfortable and as expected hotel easy to walk to from kings cross or faringdon second hotel we ve stayed in and we have stayed in quite a few that doesn t have a wee biscuit with the tea coffee tray very bright and welcoming the breakfast was very good but it was expensive very nice hotel and good location nice room and friendly staff we liked the swimmingpool and the sauna a lot the breakfast was good and we liked it very much tv was annoying water made skin burn indian restaurant not great but few options nearby when raining alarm went off multiple times during the night without any announcement thin walls changes in nightly rates were extreme as was cost of breakfast generally very nice rooms reasobable location great as near kings cross but away from the craziness short walk to city university the bath was too small when we arrived in the room all we could hear was loud drilling above us to the point we went out and was then woken up at  am on the saturday morning again to loud drilling above us so again we went out we could have been made aware of this when we checked in asked for a quite room but was woken during the night by a noisy child next door or above me a few times corridor fire doors need improving to close quietly after noisy late guests fling them open the bathroom and room were much improved on a hotel close by i have stayed in before the fire alarm went off with   sounds at    am nothing was said about it they charge almost   per hr for wifi we stayed at another holiday inn a few weeks previously wi fi was free we had a smoking room which is unusual to get these days room was clean comfy room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto might sound like i m being fussy but if you re dropping     on a sandwich you least expect it to be right also the hotel was cheaper   a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at  am on a sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head we rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a sunday morning even with the discount rooms look new and are modern with a lovely bathroom with rain shower and a comfy bed with huge tv no coat hooks in bedroom breakfast food was passable have recently had better breakfast buffet at another hotel my partner thought the hash browns were too greasy hotel room was very clean and fresh also the gym and swimming pool was very impressive location very near kings cross a   brisk minute walk no negative the room was a decent size clean and tidy the bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows the distant from the station was okay just a short walk they have some parking but they reserve it for thier managers not what they told me after i drove for two hours becuase they said it would be ok to get parked the recommended the ncp down the road in farringdon do not use it it is like a scene from a horror film and i doubt your car would be there in the morning the refurbished rooms are excellent and the beds are so much better than other chain hotels no halal in breakfast staff were helpful especially marco the concierge the location is great   min from kings cross station the breakfast was delicious and the bed very comfortable no negative very good value for the money we paid and this in central london clean comfortable and with amenities like a pool we didn t have the time to use it unfortunately will definitely come back and spend more time here a good   minute walk from train tube station expensive for what s on offer better quality hotels in london for similar cost clean fresh room polite staff a mix up on my booking made me quite annoyed when i checked in one receptionist couldn t do much to assist but another redeemed the situation and allocated me the room i had booked no positive the bed was uncomfortable mattress far too hard shocked at having to pay     each to use gym and pool never had to do this at any other hotel i hav stayed at as always been free for guests really disappointing the indian food from the in house restaurant was delicious wifi did not work rooms never ever had   square metres as advertised they had a maximum of   matresses were worn out quiet location though still central the bar staff were not very friendly the toilets for the foyer bar area and restaurant are in the basement which is too far away cost of wifi is ridiculous in this day and age wifi is generaly free everywhere i was thoroughly disappointed to see this hotel charged for such a basic service this would definitely make me think twice about staying there again the room was very comfortable and clean the indian restaurant was also excellent location was good they put us in a diabled room for some reason the walls were so thin you heard everything soup dispenser empty hair dryer not working nothing to shout about staff rude and impolite very uncooperative staff very unfriendly and rude impolite and did not help will never go again and won t recommend to anyoneno negative room was newly refurbished and immaculate two choices of shower head which was great bed super comfy no noise from outside great and friendly staff pool jacuzzi steam room and sauna are fab as are changing facilities and the fact towels are provided plus there s a spinny thing to dry your swim clothes breakfast was delivered by room service on time and nice and hot thank you limited parking spaces and expensive bedroom for what you get also food menu for room service limited to what u can order location in central london very good no negative very comfortable recently upgraded rooms friendly and helpful staff good restaurant quiet location and easy walking distance of kings cross and euston the name is quite misleading as it s a good   minute walk from kx more if you ve heavy luggage and it s not really in bloomsbury smokers and cigarette butts outside the main door comfortable well appointed room efficient check in unable to connect to wifi in room empty mini bar no complimentary drinking water far from underground stations charge for health club friendly staff queit area breakfast and pool twice asked for a champagne bucket and ice to be delivered to the room once upon checking in and by calling reception from the room some   mins later it never arrived room was very well appointed and comfortable hotel was expensive probably due to high demand rugby world cup disappointed at having to pay extra for wifi and indoor pool also major refurbishment is taking place on  th floor so there was noise of drilling even on weekend this was not mentioned at time of booking hotel is modern and clean we were in refurbished room on the  th floor with new shower room and fresh decor hotel is     minutes walk from kings cross and not far from british museum it is a good walk from kings cross not a bad location for what it is but i would suggest it is a     minute walk the staff were personable and attentive they acted like humans and treated me like one it was very nice free mini bar was very nice the building was lovely shame breakfast wasn t included it is way over the top expensive it s a little bit out of the way of tube stations etc very friendly and helpful staff choice if pillows hard and soft feathered and synthetic etc the wifi connection is completely useless no matter how many times i tried and with   different login account i still can t login had to consume my roaming data the hotel is under renovation and luckily i got a brand new furnished room that i m quite happy with   min walk to king s across underground station and   min walk to the british museum fire alarm seems to go off frequently causing lifts to stop working objected to paid wi fi fabulously comfy bed never slept so well excellent room and bathroom we arrived to be greeted by a very grumpy receptionist who despite me assuring her i had followed all the procedures and requested a newly refurbished room as part of my booking kept barking at me that you had to pay more our friends who were also staying at the hotel followed exactly the same process paid exactly the same and got a new room we were not asked for a swipe of any card etc so then struggled to get anything in addition to the room room service was a joke we were woken at  am by the smoke alarm and when we asked at breakfast how this had happened we got waved away by the staff as if they were trying to keep it a big secret the icing on the cake was the     my husband paid for a bottle of sparkling water from the hotel shop yes     our room didn t have any hot drink making facilities or water in the room so we needed something an absolute rip off and a horrible hotel with a dreadful approach to customer service do not waste your money i have stayed in many many hotels in london which have in some cases been cheaper but in all cases had a much better experience absolutely will not be staying there again neither will our friendsno positive we booked a smoking room as both myself and my husband smoke but were surprised that the windows didn t open at all although the air conditioning was enough to keep the room cool and air circulating it would have been nice to let some fresh air in even if it was from just a crack the staff were lovely and very helpful room was a good size and the paid parking on site was reasonable the wifi wasn t free lame staying here helped us from feeling homesick way nicer than any holiday inn i ve stayed at in the states great rooms great staff amazing bathroom the location can t be beat either no food even a sandwich after   i was travelling from europe arriving at  am and i was offered a takeaway which would take  hr to arrive room and building was clean and well decorated wifi a ridiculous price air conditioning in room not working properly to be fair though we didn t report it so can t really complain excellent place with newly refurbished room we can t get any alcohol after    pm that was quite inconvenient it was perfect and comfortable stay i got free wifi beds are very much comfortable d cor was a bit tired breakfast fine but nothing to write home about good place to stay in order to catch the eurostar at st pancras the next morning bit further away from kings cross than i was expecting we stayed for our   year anniversary and the staff bumped us up to executive suite free of charge thankyou nothing really it was just convenient because it was close to station a lot of restaurants around but within walking distances wasn t lavish but it did the job and staff were super friendly i didn t try their food so cant advice there that i only stayed one night i was slightly apprehensive to come to this place due to some reviews as i always read reviews before i go somewhere due to excitement and curiosity anyway the staff at the front where very friendly and so was every other staff member that i came into contact with the room was beautiful i had asked for a smoking room as my other half smokes but when i went into the room it turned out it was non smoking so i called reception to point out this error they then told me i had been upgraded to an executive room which was fantastic to find out who can complain at being upgraded for free not me that s for sure lol overall me and my boyfriend enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this place nothing room  the bed was really comfy loved the bathroom and just the room in general room service was nice breakfast was good too didn t want to check out i parked in the carpark for   mins in the morning with permission and got a parking ticket that s the thanks i gotno positive the fact it said   minute from kings cross which it definatly is not its a good   min walk very modern clean hood facilitiesgood value unable to open the window so a night with the a c on very comfortable bed and pillows and an excellent en suite shower we had some food in the bar but it took a long time to arrive and was cold when we got it the hotel was very nice and the staff friendly air conditioning was weak and didn t really cool down filter issue excellent staff helpful and friendly all facilities were clean and tidy was a nice stay but to have to pay to use the gym when i paid   for one night was very badno positive price of food and beer good but expensive breakfast best i ve had it needed to be expensive but nice staff great all of emno negative great clean hotel and quality staff very convenient location as i had to take a train from st pancras international walking distance the staff took too long to answer the phone and didn t feel it was great value for money great location and nice shower location wasn t great weather not too good so longish walk to tube stations a pain limited bus routes too friendly helpful staffno negative the room was great lovely bed i had a sofa as well as a nice big tv and lovely bathroom the spa was also good the baggage attendant in my opinion was rude and self important the room was very comfortable and clean the spa receptionist were friendly specifically booked this hotel as it had a pool which had a fault with the water being too cold and was therefore was unavailable comfortable roomno negative bed was really comfy like the double type shower feature and the sit down shower was a real bonus after a long day walking around london the room was ridiculous hot changing the thermostat made no difference hardly slept a wink the breakfast buffet was the best i ve ever had the hotel was a bit farther from public transport than expected but it was our fault after all when we chose it no positiveno negative the bedrooms were lovely clean and comfortable the breakfast was also really good both selection and quality really good hotel would come againno negative it is a very nice hotel had a quiet room as per my request i chose it for proximity to kings cross station and it was within easy walking distance only one bottle of water and one glass got a double room hello would like a bath sheet rather than small bath towel bed very comfy no negative good was amazing did not feel like i was in a holiday inn well done to them soo many beers to choose from too the health club didn t have enough lockers and was closed one day disappointing as this is the reason we picked this hotel breakfast and room the only thing poor tv channel selection i liked the whole experience from checking in to checking out and hotel is in a good location     gpb fee for one day access to swimming pool location very clean and nice rooms swimming pool fast wifi comfortable bed nothing everything staff was wonderful very very helpful lively but quiet place great location had a nice room the bar too was great we were freezing cold despite the air con being at its highest tv remote didn t work the bed was comfy shower was nice the bed and pillows didn t sleep well neither did my family on a outher room same for them location and overall cleanliness that we did not know the hotel was as far away from kings cross station given that it was named the kings cross holiday innno positive nothing the location was great near the train station and a nice eating area near by great for sadlers wells theatre rooms lovely and clean could have tea coffee facilities in rooms the pillows the bed the bathroom was very clean iron and ironing board really big help when someone tells me i can have a cooked breakfast i would presume it would be hot not cold rooms were clean and tidy along with toilet and shower not enough lifts to take guests to ground floor no stairs as alternative long waits to access free lift newly refurbished rooms very comfortable building work noise lift being out of of order and having to walk down the bleak stairwell not good check in slow bed and room nice no negative the staff was very nice the hotel is located close to restaurant and king s cross station and the room was spacious the breakfast was only just warm the quilt on the bed is far too hot even with the fan on cool the room was extremely clean and modern can t believe you pay c   per night and are then asked to pay     for a poorly equipped gym recently refurbished quiet wifi didn t work television didn t work room was very small   minute wait for lifts very expensive for what you get no positive i couldn t open the window for fresh air i liked being able to control the room temperature and the room was very comfortable no negative it s easy to get to from the train just a few minutes walk it is going though an upgrade at moment so not everything is assable on my visit rude quests that were impolite to very helpful restaurant staff room lovely and bed very comfy lovely clean towels daily there was no heating so we couldn t have a bath in the morning loved the comfort in the room lovely bathroom and spacious in room unruly kids slamming doors running in corridor tilll late at night very slow elevators rooms not ready on arrival at    pmno positive cleanliness hairs in bath glasses not very clean in bathroom friendly receptionist booked my    am cab to accommodate bike for ride london staff was not friendly and in middle of the stay water supply was stop for   hrs could have planned better no positiveno negative although the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment we still found it did not disrupt our stay in any way and the staff were excellent no negative very comfy bed duvet nice and light no air con noise good view from our room and great location superb breakfast someone walking in to my room at    am and the construction works drilling starting in the hotel at  am really comfy beds and excellent service the noise of the work going on and the room was by the lift and it was a bit to noisy the bed was very comfortable for the price i really couldn t fault anything the staff were extremely friendly and helpful very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend part of the hotel was being upgraded but obviously this is a temporary measure the rooms were brand new due to being newly refurbished could have told us where the facilities were located didn t find the kettle and tea coffee facilities until we left that morning the pillows were so uncomfy i couldnt sleep properly and the car park was being refurbed so i had to park a bit down the road the bed was comfy i thought it was closer to kings cross station so everytime we went out it was a     min walk to nearest tube hotel was all goodno negative spacious and clean room with a comfortable bed to rest in after a busy conference day nice pubs in the neighbourhood to visit before cleaner left a dirty cloth in the room and the bed throw and cushions were gone room newly refurbished and very spacious and cleanno negative great location only a few minutes walk from kings cross looks further on the map but can be reached easily very comfy bed and nice sizable room the rooms and furniture are very old the bed is very uncomfortable definitely needs refurbishment not at all worth the price i paid no positive there was construction going on starting  am also for   nights the fire alarm rang un the middle of the night breakfast is not bad cleaners very keen didn t think to put sign out before   am hypnos bed very comfortable we had a refurbished room and it was very nice you have to take the bus to nearest tube i e kings cross the staff were very helpful and supportive specious room with new furniture the toilet was not clean upon arrival but was cleaned as soon as we called housekeeping the bed was super comfortable and the location was great the room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart we were upgraded on arrival which was lovely shower and bathroom facilities were excellent staff were always helpful and welcoming they spoke english and were more than happy to answer any questions we might have location was perfect courtyard had lovely places to dine or get a cocktail   mins walk from the metro and not far from notre damme or the pantheon lovely area for dining breakfast was low quality although many choices there are great restaurants next door howecer and stores nearby space in the mini bar and coffee maker in room was a bonus great staff great location quite clean and charming lovely rooms and common spaces nothing really absolutely everything except maybe the coffee at breakfast but we are fussy re coffee we arrived before checkin after taking a week to cycle from london our room was ready and the staff were welcoming and so accommodating regarding our bikes we were on the top floor lovely room and very comfortable bed loved looking out our window across the sorbonne it is a great location with an m s nearby for supplies the corridors could have been a little wider for luggage a better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and the tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too however apart from that everything was perfect the location was great the bed was comfy and the lighting was fab head to le petit ch telet near notre dame for a fabulous meal fairly tight room for three people sharing we were three travelers and the room was pretty tight for three people but that is europe for you the location was very close to notre dame and it was very easy to walk everywhere in the city great restaurants nearby friendly bilingual staff we were on the top floor and a heavy rain storm resulted in the ceiling leaking over the third bed they immediately provided an extra room for my dad for no additional charge wifi worked perfectly took the train metro to the airport due to traffic which was great location about an hour from airport which would have been an extremely expensive cab ride we chose to get breakfast at nearby restaurants so can t comment on the food the room is quite small but not out of the norm for europe there is very little room to have suitcases open we had a triple room and it was very comfortable sleeping for three people good storage in the room for odds and ends the bathroom was actually quite large for europe and was very modern the shower was exceptional lots of hot water and great water pressure nice room with wood beams in the ceiling and a view of the street in front of the sorbonne the location was excellent on a pedestrian square with restaurants and access to lots of shopping and other restaurants with a short walk there s no where to hang up towels after a shower and the room was very compact the staff are friendly and breakfast is plentiful we had a nespresso machine in the room which was frequently used the metro was like  min by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it takes like   to champ elysees or madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day the hotel and the room was clean the stuff is nice and helpful some restaurants around which is not that expensive a supermarket close to the hotel and many stores for shopping norte dame is like  min by walk and you will find a lot of restaurants too also behind the main street they are little restaurants that sells menu for     and kebabs and souvenirs instead of a door knob there was an opening in the bathroom door clean and comfortable and the front desk was very helpful and friendly the location was very convenient walking distance to notre dame and latin quarter and great restaurants some staff were not very friendly took a while to warm up to you there was some miss communication with the airier pick up i gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up they could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code i provided but little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you paris metro loved the location and the style of the hotel it was noisy i was in a room in the ground floor which was noisy and not very illuminated location is very good charming neighborhood and square in front of the hotel while we were lucky to be given an upgrade the room was smallish but this is common place in paris the   most important aspects of any hotel imo were all met and exceeded expectation location staff bed firm and shower best i ve ever experienced nothing our stay at select hotel was absolutely great the room is comfortable and clean and looks exactly as shown in the photos the location is great and the stuff is real nice the day we left our flight was late and they left us the room until the evening with no extra charge it s not obvious and we really appreciate it so thanks again forget to ask about the airport shuttle fantastic location walking distance to norte dame de paris or jardin du luxembourg  th arr is safe area and have plenty good restaurant the hotel is combination of historical building and modern design the shower is very enjoyable already recommended to my friend and will choose again next time to paris no negative excellent location walking distance to the louvre and notre dame cathedral easy access to subway which takes you to champs elysees and the eiffel tower many restaurants and cafes withing walking distance to the hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful rooms are a good size compared to european standards   wish they their room service was actually   hours as mentioned unfortunately when we ordered meals by    pm the staff had already left the staff apparently was from the cafe restaurant next door   staff always helpful in terms of directions to places to visit hiring us a van for our moulin rouge show and trip to the airport sorting our very late dinners from restaurant next door   decor i am a lover of cacti and this place had an awesome display a couple of times when they were cleaning the rooms the staff appeared a little disorganized vacuum cleaners left in the middle of the halls rooms are a little small but well furnished the location is fantastic literally walking distance to all the major sites ambience and atmosphere of the area and hotel is wonderful not too touristy hotel staff were great and informative fluent in english they have the tickets for major attractions louvre eiffel etc on site so that made it easier tv had only french channels no bbc cnn euronews english i find it unusual not having any newchannel in english where most customers were not french please control your payment one day before check out time i checked my bill one before my checkout day in my case there was a discrepancy between their room rate and booking com rate it was later corrected i had the print out booking com t helped me if it were on the day i check out there would be problem advise for booking com customers i like the location safety of the hotel just in front of the sorbon university square no negative best hotel we can ask for the location was absolutely amazing near everything the bad was so comfy pls note that the bath is without door that way i think the room is recommended for couples only we will be back for sure at night you have to ring the bell to go inside the hotel and usually that takes time so be prepared to wait on the door from   to   min friendly staff each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel it was not possible to sleep with windows open the sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue st jaque he was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut on our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review the room was very small we had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time we preferred staying in the  th as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores this was just our preference though it was clean and modern access to the luxembourg gardens was nice for morning walks lots of people doing their morning runs around the park there a weak stream of water like all europe we got used to it we herd the noise street but we were so tierd so we slept good centeral aircodition work on heat in april so its a problem if its hot days we had     zelius degree so it was ok for us lovly and helpfull staff old building renivation rooms nice and convinient rooms very good place very nice new shower good restaurants near hotel near metro clean room good bed the rooms are tiny and if you have suitcases don t get the standard room it s as big as my walk in closet also the view from the back rooms is of other guests windows i don t suggest get a front facing room the location is good booked small double we expected a small room not child size double bed i am     and with my head on the pilow my feet were out of bed resulting in a poor night s sleep helpful receptionist explained the hotel was full but nevertheless moved us to a twin room for the second night sleeping in separate beds meant we had some room to move but again the beds were very narrow we would have liked a hotel bar area by lift looked like may have been intended as a bar but was not staffed good showers spotlessly clean clever interior design retaining original features mixed with modern art welcoming on arrival and pleasant staff no negative fantastic location with at least   metro rer stops within walking distance very central yet in more bohemian relaxed area than the other side of the river our room looked into the fountains and had a lovely balcony and shuttered windows which made for a wonderful view would be nice to have also some vegetables for breakfast perfect location everything in walking distance metro   minutes notre dame   louvre   pantheon and cluny museum just behind the corner very friendly staff clean rooms and good breakfast choose this hotel no doubts no complaints but do not go to boullion chartier restaurant if recommended it is cheap but not good food very basic long queues by locals as cheap ran out of food options early in the evening the hotel was well placed for walking to attractions like louvre and notre dame close to metro shops cafes and restaurants nearby were good wifi signal this is a permanent weakness in the hotel and it seems to me that room   was not the only which had connection problems as there were always guests in the reception sitting in the sofas taking advantage of the good wifi there was there apart from this issue i strongly recommend select hotel for those who do not mind to have a wifi operational signal successfully active only in the hotel reception but i do repeat this is the only dislike i can tell from select hotel and i shall be there again when i get back to paris no positive the tiny lift and very narrow staircase to the room and the limited space in the room i stayed in could be a problem if you have luggage nice hotel in a great location near sorbonne rooms are small but confortable and have exposed beams fairly standard hotel furniture and fittings and small bathroom beginning to show signs of wear friendly staff coffee machine at breakfast could be improved the slippers the tea coffee making facilities the cushion in the bath tub were very very welcome and a true plus very quiet and well located no negative definitely not a   star hotel i d say   stars very well located rooms are small and a little old room i was staying at didn t even have a shower small bath tub a normal person can t fit in breakfast was average only worth it if already included bed was very comfortable and staff was nice there was no soap in the bathroom the night manager tried to find some for us in the hotel but didn t find any the safe was very small could not fit a laptop breakfast was so so excellent location the bedroom was quite pretty the hotel looked nice in general no negative excellent location extremely central yet quiet due to being tucked away from the main street on the charming little square in front of sorbonne the rooms are modern and decently sized we re in paris all the staff is always very friendly helpful and professional the wifi works just fine the area is full of a perfect mix of interesting shops restaurants and sights to visit the room is a bit small for guests coming for long trips with a bigger suitcase new clean and reasonable location for restaurants in st michel not too close to avoid the noise the continental breakfast wasn t worth it worth going out or the hotel the opera music playing in the lift was great and my room looked far better than the limited picture displayed on the website i stayed in a deluxe room which had a great view of the area the bed was a bit hard for us but that s simply a matter of preference the region of jardin de luxembourg is a great location you re a bit away from the masses near the eiffel tower but there s still plenty around to do in walking distance ile de paris with the notre dame the jardin de luxembourg itself the pantheon and i could go on for a while more the hotel and our room was very clean the combination of authentic and new elements see pictures of the breakfast room vs the entrance hall worked remarkably well the staff was very kind we got upgraded to a better room with a splendid view room   sight of the university building and place de la sorbonne the nights were quiet the room was well equipped what more can one wish for hotel select and its room   are definitely a recommendation i forgot a jacket on my room so i would have liked if they would have contacted me to let me know i had left it so i could make arrangements to collect it before i left paris to south africa no positiveno negative we had very late return flight and staff very kindly offered us use a room to rest and wait instead of hanging around couldn t thank them enough nothing staff is very friendly they upgrade me to have a room with more luminosity it s clean and a quiet place near by many things to stay in paris everything was perfect merci tous i didn t have breakfast in hotel because we were walking all around paris all day with friends but other customers said it was excellent it was my first time in paris and my room in select hotel was better than i could imagine l gance et courtoisie caract risent cet h tel the entrance warm and decorated creatively the bed was extra comfortable and the bathroom a real dream as a professor i appreciated the view to the sorbonne university a real special feeling located in place de la sorbonne near statione cluny it was close to everything paris has to offer the staff the chief receptionist and mademoisselle tess were very helpfull and polite in everything we asked politeness characterizes persons and hotels in select hotel politeness is the number one rule they make you feel comfortable it was sunday and i had to return to athens after   days in paris because of my work in the school if i could i would stay more in select hotel i would do it without hesitation it was a perfect choice walking down place de la sorbonne and watching the view from our hotel window made feel like writing a poem merci son merveilleux personnel pour l accueil nous allons certainement pr f rer ce choix parfait pour les couples ps i would definately recommend it to all of my friends and persons i appreciate i wish to return back to my room in select hotel in spring it was un unforgettable and unique experience thomas b all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed you have to walk   or   min to get to the nearest subway station very clean room and comfortable bed good wifi everywhere except in breakfast place the hotel is close to some major museums and attractions like louvre and noterdam and other smaller ones the hotel is very warm in winter and has a very beautiful cheminee in the lobby very calm room that you don t hear any noises neither form inside nor outside of the hotel could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature i am sure if we had asked it would have been done this is being nit picky though the bed and pillows were comfortable the shower had great pressure the staff were helpful and friendly location suited us perfectly as it was close to a number of metro stations fun bars and restaurants with plenty of happy hour s and the river we would recommend to our friends the breakfast starts at   while i had to leave at     i am not sure whether the labor laws in france allow it to start the breakfast at   but it would be nice after years of passing     nights in paris i finally found a hotel i really like and where i will return this was my second stay here the location is excellent the room is larger and nicer than in most of paris hotels staff is friendly and helpful no restaurant and bar was closed at   i had no wifi in my room i complained   times to one member of staff and twice to another it never got resolved so i had to sit in the reception to use my tablet were they watched me do this the hotel was in a nice location it was clean and the staff were very frendly rooms are on the small side although that s normal for paris location is a little more south than most tourist sites but transit is available great location right near transit and lots of restaurants but still a quiet street two restaurants right next door even the room s are great too very comfortable bed everything was neat and clean nice bathroom good breakfast in the mornings shower tiles joins had some mold that were almost completely cleaned after i mentioned it to the reception the room design and comfort is fantastic nice combination of the old wooden ceiling and modern furniture and artwork great bathroom and fantastic walk in shower beautiful and modern interior friendly staff all went well with me i spent   nights with my wife in paris i jut loved this hotel very well placed near to rer and metro in the middle of the quartier latin minutes walk to many site no negative a really nice hotel located close to barrio latino perfect to walk and eat the hotel it s really marvelous rooms nice and artistic the attention at reception perfect and really attentive and friendly and of course professional thanks so much for everything i ll come back for sure wi fi is an issue select must solve at all i personally talked to them in a very positive attitude but it is undoubtful that i shall continue to choose select hotel as my staying in paris no positive bedroom small for an executive double little drawer or luggage space excellent breakfast but dungeon of a breakfast room plenty of choice with far brighter ambiance outside hotel no negative first of all i have to say that amazing people are working at this hotel marie helen laure nordine and mazier it is impossible to accept them just as staff these people are great people warm and attentive with lovely sense of humor making you to feel that you are surrounded with close and really caring friends that s simply their nature the hotel itself is nicely designed i was staying on the  th floor the room was functional and clean with very comfortable bed it was a bit small i mean the room but you don t waste time in the hotel room when you are in paris the location of the hotel is perfect in between two metro stations luxembourg and saint michel next to sorbone and a few steps from pantheon there is a bus station about   m from the hotel although in the middle of the city it was quite and peaceful the fountains on the plateau in front of the hotel were creating a specific atmosphere when in the room the feeling was like you are out of the city near some river or waterfall very relaxing there was an espresso making machine in the room with both regular and decaf coffee capsules and with a selection of tea breakfast was good nothing spectacular just good some standard ham and salami couple of traditional french cheese home made jam selection scrambled eggs with sausage croissant if you are staying in a hotel for more than one night a bit fantasy while creating the breakfast menu would be highly appreciated but again everything was very fresh nice and positive if your breakfast is not included in the room price you can have your morning coffee with fresh croissant for     euro just on the other side of the street also there are some restaurants and a marks and spencer express shop nearby in case of an emergency all in all it was really a positive experience definitely recommended hotel for your paris stay no negative very helpful staff beautiful room with a view over place de la sourbonne fantastic shower with great water pressure comfy bed this will be our paris hotel for evermore nothing i loved the place only complaint which is very minor is that i did not have my shower cap replaced more frequently yes the croissants were excellent ideally situated to explore the left bank and also not too far to musee d rsay and the louvre nice little restaurants close by and area was good for lots of walking am planning to stay here again staff all spoke very good english and were very pleasant and helpful hotel seems over designed design features sometimes seems more pretty than practical open bathroom design is trendy now and there s a shower curtain that provided some privacy but there s no bathroom door toilet is separate but there s no sink so you have to walk around to the other side of the room to wash your hands and there s no bin in the toilet location close to notre dam convenient for sightseeing lots of restaurants and cafes nearby elevator finds it hard to cope in busy periods e g morning checkout time cleanliness efficiency of staff good value breakfast quiet rooms despite location of hotel in buzzing student quarterno negative the location was excellent we had the great good luck of being upgraded to a large room overlooking place de la sorbonne even though the street had traffic during the day the windows and air conditioning were spectacularly effective in making the room quiet from this location we walked easily to sites the pantheon jardin de luxembourg musee cluny and just wandered around the small streets of the latin quarter we could not have been more pleased with the location the hotel and especially the desk staff breakfast was just ok could have included eggs but that s very minor beautiful rooms with a great view from the small balcony latest facilities tv in the bathroom super big comfy bed very friendly staff and great location minor things the lift was a bit small there were no english language channels available and sometimes they were a bit slow replenishing hot foods at breakfast clever design made use of a small space so we never felt uncomfortable or cramped in the room good hanging and storage space luxurious bathroom generous breakfast buffet with a varied range of foods and helpful staff at reception the location is perfect for exploring paris on foot or by metro very good value for money we would stay here again the breakfast is the weakest link they have an outstanding breakfast at hotel des gobelins if they could have something similar i would never stay at a different hotel in my future stays in paris location space everything the room was a little small and the breakfast area too hot at times very friendly helpful staff always able to offer guidance when requested very clean rooms wonderful location the tv didn t work although we did not call for help the light switches were hard to figure out i wasn t able to turn on the reading lights on the bed without turning on the rest of the room lights not a big deal for a one night stay great style lovely lobby and salle a manger good deal for the room the small size was fine for us comfortable bed and very quiet very good breakfast we appreciated the dinner recommendation it was very good location was excellent the breakfast was a bit limited and the staff for this service were very slow most of the people were complaining about it bed very comfortable ac system working very well during the days i stayed which were very hot location excellent just   minutes walking to notre dame and easy to reach from the airport wit the rer b no negative the staff was very professional the selection of complimentary candy was a surprise the room was excellent as was the location we would definitely stay there again elevator was a bit small but in a building this beautiful and old in such a lovely location that can quickly be forgiven this is a gorgeous setting and very well located i will stay here again on my next trip to paris it was like a dream the breakfast selection wasn t great and they ran out of a lot of things staff were very friendly rooms were very clean beds were super comfortable liked the touch of a robe and slippers coffee machine in room was brilliant we were up on the  th floor and could not cool our room down since the air conditioning was set centrally very warm another disappointment were the directions from cdg airport that were given from the select website instead of the recommended bus we would take the train much quicker and easier with no transfers other than those two things we absolutely loved our stay and will be back perfect quiet location in the latin quarter delicious breakfast in the charming cellar great view of the gorgeous old sarbonne university from our huge open window loved the mini fridge and coffee maker in room comfortable beds wonderful shower and helpful and friendly staff so happy with this small clean boutique hotel the cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle i stayed here for   nights and breakfast was provided with the price of the room the location i very convenient close to several metro lines and also a     minute walk from major attractions like the seine notre dame pantheon sainte chapelle etc the area felt very safe and there are tons of restaurants and cafes nearby it is also a short distance from shopping areas staff was very friendly and helpful the room we had was facing the street and we got a great view of a nearby chapel and the water fountain and in the evenings musicians would be playing at the cafe downstairs we were also surprised that the room was a bit bigger than what was in the pictures online breakfast was included for us which was great because the food was definitely solid and there was a wide variety to choose from i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in the center of paris close to tourist attractions no negative amazing value for money incredibly central beautifully modern comfortable hotel unlike other hotels i have stayed in in paris which would charge the same if not more the air conditioning was very much appreciated on hot parisian days no negative the staff was welcoming and extremely helpful the hotel room was modern yet had historical touches that we loved the location was within walking distance of the louvre and many shops along saint germain des pres wonderful choice for us no negative this hotel had a lot of character but what really made it special was the service our return flight home was canceled and we needed to stay in paris for an extra few days the staff worked with us to make sure we could stay at the hotel as long as needed rooms on the small side but man its paris and this is a lovely hotel to stay in and area to visit great location in latin quarter helpful staff modern elegant and very clean hard to fault staff super helpful and allowed my niece to practice her french where most parisians automatically speak english it was the purpose of the trip rooms are small but this is standard and are well equipped rooms have ac but it appeared to be centrally controlled at night which was a bit annoying nothing everything firstly the room was amazing for a small double this was more than expected the breakfast was lovely and you can eat as much as you like buffet style the view from the room was lovely over the fountains and would always come back no parking everything was nice air condition breakfast good bed quality separated shower and toilet on the room and beautiful design of hotel and room bedroom a little small but more than adequate toaster slow very comfortable bed luxurious bathroom shower area central location close to many bars shops and restaurants modern decor great tv neither the phone or tv worked but it didn t t matter that much we notified staff as we were leaving staff were friendly and were available when we required them the room was vert comfortable room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room nice foyerno negative very friendly and helpful staff the hotel has everything you could want and it has central location but still very quiet and next to a charming square place de la sorbonne excellent choice i didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed if one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower i know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time the room was not too bad what i didn t like see opposite page breakfast could have been better beautiful room we went for honeymoon and birthday staff was very friendly willing to help with travel information storage of baggage and tourist attractions hotel was in a beautiful location wonderful view of the parisian architecture stayed in the smaller room which was still quite spacious with beautiful wooden beams very cozy and romantic i was given two single beds instead of the double that i booked this was not changed for the first two nights of my   night stay the cleaner used a very powerful and to me at least unpleasant room spray despite requests not to breakfast was poor the location was very good the room was of a good size the bathroom was excellent the staff were helpful no thing actually the location just perfect the decoration is breathtaking it is very clean in each aspect the breakfast is modern and delicious was twin single beds pushed together instead of double shower was awesome location was great staff helped us with early check out room ready on time some people will find the rooms too small for their taste we did not mind and were happy to compromise on space for the beautiful decor breakfast is just ok so book without and eat at nearby cafes stylish modern rooms and artsy public spaces though small the rooms are nicely kitted out with colorful decor and the rainfall showers are wonderful location on the place de la sorbonnie with its lovely fountains is very pleasant proper double bed rather than   singles put together really good location great hotel good sized room and very good value breakfast staff very helpful and friendly no negative excellent location very friendly staff with perfect attitude i definitely come back again nearby   closed secure parking with   per day the maid service is iffy we stayed for   days and only had our room cleaned for   of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon the biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms it s as if the designer thought how can i make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use the sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow the taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them you have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so the rooms even for paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great the location is perfect and the front desk staff friendly and knowledgeable all was great with the hotel only thing was the fee to get a taxi back to the airport was   euros more going back because the hotel was booking it for us very very odd absolutely fab hotel can t believe i was so lucky to have found it and book for our stay beautifully decorated super chic and quirky yet still comfortable close to notredame and the louvre   mins from the metro surrounded by nice shops and restaurants breakfast although basic was lovely and fresh perfect stay will be back thank you nothing at all excellent location very central to tourist attractions nice ambience very good restaurants next door the room was only  sq m but each and every inch of it was put to good use rooms are a bit dated iron was old and leaked dirt on to clothes they could have cleared tables of used plates so we didn t have to great location easy to access friendly staff room was really quite small limited with   bags as was the bed though you couldn t have got a bigger bed in there i know they are in the process of renovating some floors and maybe could add better lighting to the hallways leading up to room and bigger numbers on doors amazing location stepping out into a little square with a fountain bookshops and restaurants the staff were great they had a laptop we could use which was great most amazing shower head i have ever seen wifi access was non existent in my room near the lobby and at breakfast awesome location just outside the sorbonne helpful staff comfy room albeit a bit small i had searched for a three person room and was disappointed with the size of the room and that there were not three equal beds the third bed looked more like a sofa bed other than that it was fine location is good cleanliness could be improved we found a big lump of hair in the room all in all i didn t find that the hotel met my expectations the location was nice the beds good the bathroom and shower was really nice pricing is very high particularly for early spring fair sized room comfortable bed great breakfasts clean modern and beautiful decor good selection of tv stations loved breakfast room spotless ideal location easy walk to the seine many shops and restaurants around really enjoyed proximity to luxembourg gardens friendly helpful staff breakfast was somewhat limited clean well presented hotel set in a lovely small square plenty of bars and food places and only   minutes from metro and rer stations bathroom tap designs were absurd trouble to operate with wet hands or know which was cold hot pressure in shower but this was minor should not stop a visit position view from hotel would go back also would recommend unable to access wifi at the hotel had to go to a cafe to access limited selection for breakfast as always as a solo traveler i was given an inner room overlooking the courtyard good location friendly staff room was on ground floor so very noisy every night and early morning and windows were on to street no full length mirror no extractor in bathroom so room hot poor lighting in room all yellow and none in bed area shower is boiling hot or cold no medium temp complained on check out didn t get anything back more of a oh well look location there was no dividing door between the bedroom and the bathroom no shower good location staff were really friendly we arrived early and were able to check in with no extra charge we have no complaints at all excellent central location helpful friendly staff and very comfortable beds we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely stay at the select again no negative the overall   day experience at the select hotel was outstanding the staff was superb with special thanks to naomi the day manager the room hotel was absolutely the best we have experienced in paris to date   visits over   years and a great value we have paid much more for less quality in the past great view of square university of paris and cluny museum and notre dame in the distance room amenities were excellent we will return to this hotel in the future great hotel terrible room was not accurate to how the photos looked at all the room was tiny the floor was dirty and the room was so overused and old i could not believe how much we paid for such a horrible looking badly kept room no positive we stayed   nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub arranged to the  st floor which view was kind of dark and dusty at least not as shown on the photos no door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk the facility varies from room breakfast was a bummer what matters is the service when i ask staff if there s any kettle or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always nop we don t have nop you have to buy it costs   euro so are u taking or not i don t think a hotel deserves a   star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives my recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs that s what good hotel should do not sure if i was being picky because of this is my honeymoon at least this hotel has rooms for improvement location very disappointed with the wifi in the room no wifi at all when i was told it was later i was told it was the location of the room that the wifi was not workingno positive towel racks would be nice we had a small well laid out room the shower was heavenly the bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was smart perhaps the best feature was the ability to open the windows the hotel is in such a quiet location we booked a deluxe garden view room with   single beds what did we get a room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom when we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom when we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room the complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it after our complaint re the absent shower and bathroom door in our room we were shifted to what i believe we had originally booked that room was great but that could also just be because it had a shower and a bathroom door the beds are comfy the hotel is in a great location the wifi did not always work there was no hand wash facilities in the toilet the room was a little small the couple in the next room room number   were fighting in the hallway we reported them which stopped it for   mins they then carried on for another     hrs we went out to them on two occasions and told them to keep quiet as it was    am in the morning and they had woken us up the location was good for us close to the latin quarter the shower fittings were very shiny and hard to grip but i gather they are to be replaced in september the overhead shower there was a hand grip shower as well tended to flood the whole bathroom as there was no lip to keep the water inside the shower staff almost everything location staff breakfast the room the bathroom dripping tap in bathroom not a great shower fairly poor breakfast wifi only worked in the reception overall the staff location made up for both of these minor issues very comfy bed amazing location very helpful staff the breakfast has hardly changed in   years except they now add dry scrambled eggs and baked beans not good enough in such a hotel stylish boutique on the charming place de la sorbonne best spot in paris on the left bank and walking or metro easy distance to everywhere wo want to see and do in this gorgeous city i have been staying at this hotel over   years and enjoyed the benefits of   makeovers wifi signal not great or consistent the bar and lounge was just some chairs if i wanted anything from the bar someone had to be called overpriced for what was there my room was in a far corner that was dark hard to see where the keyhole was room very small housekeeping left the hose for the vacuum in the hall for most of the daay great location i was winding down after a two month journey around europe and needed down time it worked for that staff were very friendly and helpful no negative hotel is located in a quiet place in noisy area my room windows were from patio side the room was really silent very good comfort and friendly staff i will visit hotel again there was a few places that could have used a little more detail when cleaning the room was very modern and comfortable the location is excellent no negative the croissants were not extra fleaky the bed was very comfy one day i had no bath mat another day ihad no glasses in the bathroom p the doors automatically slam when you close them it s a little annoying because of the noise great position staff very helpful stunning room nothing we were very happy the location was fantastic for getting around easily the staff were very pleasant and the area was excellent no negative the room was wonderful and very clean the staff was very nice it s a great hotel i will surely come back no negative there was a t v in the bathroom mirror plus a really large one in bedroom excellent location we could see the sorbonne from our bedroom window no negative very neer from transport options bus and metro good breakfast if you only want a bed and breakfast is expensive for that the location was perfect and charming just a few minutes to metro and st michel lot of nice restaurants nearby and good shopping chancesno negative well located hotel with very nice modern decor small but well arranged rooms will become our new go to place in parisno negative the wooden beams in the ceiling of the room are characteristic of the charming latin quarter architecture i will definitely come again small rooms are very jammed there is no minibar or kettle in these rooms good location clean hotel room sheets bathroom renovated hotel the doors of other rooms closing was a bit noisy some weird edges and trip hazards in the room cute and comfortable room no negative wonderful location close to many areas of interest yet quiet rooms friendly very helpful staff always available with help if necessary all the staff showed great help except the old reception man in the morning shift   july   he was not cooperative at all and he ruined my morning i hope the manger will do something to improve his attitude the location was great and active room was clean and comfort if u will stay in this hotel u will find alot of coffee shops and alot of resturants around u by walking only stuck in a lift for   minutes no stuff member came to talk to me or assure me was told to wait for at most an hour imagine i was suffocating in that small lift i was rescued by a friend who came an opened the lift the technician arrived after   minutes terrible experience the technician who answered the bell could speak french only hotels should have technicians for a crucial thing as a lift on standby no positive the lack of a spa was surprising given some of the other high end hotels in the area the manager concierge i feel guilty that i forgot his name was outstanding and went out of his way to make the stay excellentno negative everything is amazing very good location staff was very friendly and nice room was very charming and breakfast is good you can reach all atractions on foot the room was warm we slept fine but usually like the temperature a little cooler but enjoyed our stay the hotel was beautiful and in a great location the room was first class forniture of the room is quite elegant but old aged if you want to drink something at night you must go out because the bar closes before midnight the hotel is located in a wonderful charming place five minutes walking from tuileries no negative superb hotel fab location great sized suite and friendly and helpful staff we will be back we have staid in this area a few times and this hotel was def the best for all the above reasons a gem of a find thank you and to claire for being so helpful there is no lobby in the hotel that is a problem entrance is too small and the door opens and you are cold there when you are waiting for some one staff was very good location great bed comfortable the laundry charge was too expensive i feelt like i m being overcharged somewhat i liked every single thing about my stay amazing staff superb location outstanding services provided by all staff and they are willing to do whatever to help and make our stay pleasant nothing beautiful hotel spacious and luxurious room very clean and renovated bathroom excellent staff great selection of tv channels and free movies top location not much not to like perhaps the carpet in our particular room could use a good cleaning quite a few stains the light system was a bit overly complicated to use and it is unnerving to have the lights go completely dark while one is in the restroom the size of the room quite large especially for european standards loved the towel warmer and having a seating area in the room also having a separate door to the hallway and bath area was really nice in case one s traveling partner wanted to sleep in staff was great especially claire at the front desk a new friend for when we come back to stay no negative i think that hotel vendome is one from the best hotels in paris perfect location very good services cozy breakfast definitely i will come back here at my next stop in paris love it nothing i loved everything from the great location to the excellent staff and facilities and the outstanding restaurant would definitely recommend this hotel nothing we didn t like everyone was pleasant and friendly they were slightly late in bringing out tea one morning and so they gave it to us for free the location is perfect and the food was excellent the room had a lot of dust sad to see such wonderful furniture lamps in need of a good dusting that is my only negative comment staff was excellent they were the best bedding towels the best the room was long and the windows were positioned so high we couldn t look out of them beautiful breakfast room amazing location close to all the shops and gardens and galleries lovely staff the concierge and reception staff were fantastic the front desk staff very condencending less helpful they called me thinking i have ran away without settling accidentals and the were speaking bad things in french unbeknown to them my colleque understood french bad considering the rooms were paid only   for water and tourism tax location potters beautiful bar restaurant that they closed bcs of low occupancy we believe paris is strugling after bombing attack however instead of cutting cost they should invest in guests that do visit their hotel so they return wrong service mentality very convenient location in city centre pretty rooms great boutique hotel breakfast could be much better and bigger but than again french are not known for big breakfast buffets very good location comparatively large rooms for paris friendly staff overall very good no negative the room was very cosy the decoration and architecture contributed a lot the staff was warm while performing its duty we felt in a confortable cocoon with no icy and superficial luxury it was de bon aloi everything was to expectation beautiful hotel in very central location close to the best and most expensive shops in paris beautiful wood panelled room with blue marble bathroom so much dust behind the nightstands that i sneezed the whole time i was in the room definitely not a   star hotel also didn t feel safe to leave valuable goods in the room no positive they didn t clean the room for   days we had to tell the reception the room was not very clean the carpet was very stained for the money we expected nicer the location is great and the staff is more than helpful room was a bit dark but other rooms probably are not if the rug were changed the room would have seemed like new bathroom was very large and nice very helpful staff fantastic location the bar restaurant is lovely and inviting but breakfast wasn t included we felt for the price it should have been the bed was comfortable and linen was fresh and clean the rug could use a refresh but all in all it was very nice and we would definetly stay again there was no restaurant bar lounge or proper concierge on duty a fact of which i was not informed until we arrived and were pointed to the cramped cafe across the road in a week of rain and cold having to leave the hotel for every meal was not acceptable the room was compact with the shower within a high bath and on one occasion only one yowel given to us we ended up having breakfast inour room on a tiny table huddled like back packers this is definitely not   star place vendome is central and accessible from all directions the housekeeping and cleanileness is zero the service is below average for a   star hotel there are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed the furniture is really old compared to what i saw on the website not child friendly at all wifi was bad no positive wifi went out tv went out no ice machine they made beds but didn t clean the room breakfast was terrible and room service was twice the amount of what you could get right across the street when asked they helped but didn t go out of their way to make you feel welcome location was great room was not clean very old style and very not like the photos on the website highly disappointed for a supposed   star hotel no positiveno negative best place warm stuff very helping clean with excellent location breakfast is superb wont think twice for re booking quiet locatingno negative excellent location close to at place vendome beautiful hotel with very kind and service minded staff we really recomend this hotel the room was too small the bed size was very small no tea or coffee maker at room the staff wasnt friendly location every thing the service is so bad and poor and the breakfast also so bad the room is so bad very old furnuture nothing i like except the location fairly bland business hotel but excellent value and location excellent location close to both the gares de lyon and bercy and the lovely bercy park and the bercy village with plenty of lively restaurants and bars very good breakfast helpful staff would have been nice to have breakfast however at e  per person was way beyond our budget the hotel staff were very friendly and competent the hotel is very close to both bus and metro stations we were there for bastille day celebrations and found it very easy to get to and from the eiffel tour for the superb fireworks display bercy village has a fine selection of restaurants and small shops bercy   is a good shopping mall only   stop away from the hotel by bus the hotel doorman was the rudest and most incompetent staff i have ever met i asked him to call me a taxi for the airport and he got me one coming after   minutes while there was a line of taxis right at the corner having seen that i asked him to watch my luggages time for me to see if i can get another one at the street corner the man refused saying i am on my own finally i went with my stuff and got the taxi immediately since   of them where queuing worst groom ever excellent facilities no food after  pm at the bar but yes as room service all fine the spa is just a sauna and for some reason after  pm they don t serve food at the bar but they do deliver to the room not a very good policy for the rest all fine hardly any vegetarian options very good hotel and i was happy with the service i got there the staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful absolute value for money compared to the crazy hotel prices in paris i was supposed to pay much before i checked in since it was a booking that couldn t have been cancelled for some reason the hotel was unable to charge my card i requested them to wait till i arrived for my stay to pay in advance and they gladly accepted that and waited for me mentioning this because i have had instances before where even   star hotels have not waited and cancelled my booking so great job by pullman bercy and would absolutely recommend this to others it is close to cour de saint emilion metro station to bercy village and a couple other places where one can hang out   mins away from triumph de arc at champs de elysees which is one of the tourist spots too good coffee for breakfast and has a great yellow coloured apricot bread which one must try for sure very discourteous staff except people at the front desk rooms too small beds uncomfortable housekeeping and service staff rude the lobby and front desk staff were very helpful bar service was a bit uneven given that it was the end of the evening and they appeared to have been very busy before they recovered though checking process was outstanding superb front area staff and service focus some of best ever experienced local restaurant and bar options were great nice safe neighborhood and close to the metro station their room service i asked for tow empty glasses to my room they told me i will pay   or i can come myself to take them from bar and this what i did the reception they are very friendly and welcoming the food options available under room service were less but then again it is so close to some really amazing cafes and restaurants at bercy that one can quickly step out to grab a meal if they do not want to leave the hotel everything was great me and my partner had planned a short visit to just be with each other and the place was perfect for that i will highly recommend this hotel other than for breakfast restaurant didnt open for other meals during   night stay mould build up in showers is a dead give aeay when it comes to house keeping standards helpful staff nice welcome typical of major hotel chain the rooms are little old the breakfast is ok close to metro a lot of restaurants within walking distance bathroom has been updated clean breakfast very expensive although an excellent buffet with lots of choice hotel probably more suited to business travellers hotel restaurant was closed on the sunday evening i stayed comfortable large hotel room with welcoming and helpful english speaking staff quite good value for paris we some problems with the cleaning staff not coming back when we left the card on the door saying to come back later or if we left the card stating to do not disturbed we were interupted great breakfast very high end for europe standards wonderful experience overall nothing for me the best hotel i have seen in europe so far great quite place surround of lot of spaces to sit or walk the are many good quality restaurants nearby also small carfore branch supermarket and subway metro takes you to the centre or to the station where you can go directly and easly to the disneyland price of room service city tax added at the end of the stay even though we paid it via booking com size comfort and overall cleanliness of the room convenient strip of restaurants shops nearby cleanliness of the breakfast room ask your staff not to put bread clumbs on the floor as at the end of breakfast at     am the room does not like very clean confort of the bed and the view when we arrived they told us that our booking was canceled but i did not get any email from booking com and they arrange another room but because of availability we had to pay extra for upgraded rooms whic were available connected rooms were comfortable the toaster in the breakfast room was not working very well but that was all we struggled to find out where the car park was to park the car but finally pulled into the hotel and were helped immediately everything great my boys loved it staff helpful rooms next door to each other so that worked well with   children all clean and bed comfortable quiet room too which is always a bonus nearby bercy village lovely staff really helpful and friendly we stayed here to go to the eiffel tower and then onto disney the following day offered room upgrade for a charge which we took as we were checking in for only one night at  pm a complimentary room upgrade would have been nice gesture part of upgrade was free mini bar but there was no alcohol just one beer a small bottle of wine would have been nice good sleep quality beds sound proofing excellent for good nights sleep city view ok but as quite a distance not worth paying extra for car parked for us on arrival one night charge   euro which was very convenient the hotel was spotless staff courteous the location great we had dinner in bercy village a short stroll away where there was an abundance of restaurants with sitting in outside a great atmosphere on a saturday night overall would recommend stay again it would be better if one more blanket can be provided in the room the reception desk was very friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet was tasty will definitely come back no negative the area around this hotel boasts numerous restaurants that were very easy to access and had a variety of different cuisine the hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful not to mention the fabulous array of food for the buffet breakfast every morning outstanding overall a fabulous stay and somewhere i would definetly return to and recommend no negative the croissants was so nice n tats al we can eat not many foods we can eat there because not halal n because we are muslims the room was clean beautifull n the beds r very comfortable n all the staffs are very helpfull n friendly especially johann the front desk s staff we really enjoyed our stay at pullman paris thank you more choices for halal muslim food tq wonderful and cheerful staff esp johann benjamin simon others they re all very helpful with superb communication skills and provide positive assistance little bit far from main attractions i e the eifel tower but there is good cheap bus services right outside big spacious comfortable room no city noise and nice little extra touches we didn t like the fact that when we arrived at the hotel to check in we requested to give our credit card in order to block   euro for guarantee this was something that we have never been informed for before also this caused us a big inconvenience because we didn t have this money available for our holidays at last it became much more difficult as according to our bank s policy this money will be released in   working days everything perfect there was a noise from what sounded like to room next door humming like air conditioning through the night the mirror in the entry was not clean near everything apart from the right was excellent the staff at the restaurant absolutely missing service education doing comments about other customers bad welcoming at breakfast the staff at the lobby and bar was excellent nice bar and choice of drinks great place to work could not change my booking from twin room to standards room since it was booked through a website very unhelpful service and quite arrogant the holding fee on my credit card was hold for   weeks because the reception staff forgot to release the funds no positive my own stupidity at getting off the wrong metro station it s not bercy metro its the next one my bad not the hotels it was just perfect and gave us the opportunity to see the modern bercy village a real treat of homeliness in addition to all the sights of paris schedule in your diary to have dinner there one evening a real buzzing place bed was a tad soft staff removed the mattress enhancer for us which made for a much more comfortable sleep spacious room with a brilliant view from the floor to ceiling windows super friendly staff nothing was too much trouble for them the hotel was in the heart of bercy village amazing restaurants and bakeries right near metro too a c staff are freindly and supportive with smiley faces good breakfast in terms of quality and variety the hotel is very close to bercy village where you will find many resturants shops and cinema the metro location is also an advantage would be nice if there was a pool located ideal for metro in a safe area and perfect for sight seeing easy to reach from off the euro star from london has excellent selection of restaurants on door step in the lively bercy area facilities and standards are excellent at the hotel attentive service and prompt check in and out not much we drove this time and parking charges are quite high in the nearby public car park so a deal for hotel guests would be nice i have stayed at the pullman a number of times and always enjoy the experience staff are very friendly and attentive i tried the hotel breakfast for the first time during this visit and really enjoyed it great selection and quality with the nearby restaurants cinema park and quick access to the rest of paris on the metro it remains a great base to enjoy paris from nothing the bed was very comfortable and the shower amazing the location of the hotel was super lots of places to eat and socialise travel back and fro to tourist areas was superb too far away from champs elysee and eifel tower about  min with metro i think it is time for renovation however a nice hotel good breakfast staff friendly next to mercy village and metro quite place resutaurants surrounding the hotel the only thing that this property could use is a pool that would be the only thing that put this property over the top other than that there are no issues although the hotel was located in a business district it was very secluded it was also excessible to both taxi services and mass transit the hotel itself is beautiful it was clean and comfortable although we only at there once the food was great i can t speak highly enough about the staff flora melanie josephine to name a few were exceptional they made my wife and i extremely welcome and comfortable they were very helpful in suggesting not only places to visit but also provided directions on how to get there the whole entire staff made our stay even more enjoyable i highly suggest anyone visting this beautiful country should stay at the pullman thanks again guys restaurant close at     pm and if you like late dinner you should order from outside the rooms are very clean and your check out could be delayed till     pm also nearby lot of restaurants and coffee shops nothing our second time staying in this hotel great location and breakfast close to metro station everything was great and we will definitely come back sofa in a broken state and not meeting the standards of the room excellent quality of the facility offered for our baby crib with protection teddy bear trash for used papers baby change mattress upgraded at our arrival very efficient concierge comfortable queen size bed great location close to cour saint emilion and line m  best metro line to circulate with a stroller the employees at reception desk seemed very busy and a bit artificial i did not feel they were very interested in the guests i traveled with my husband and my daughter so we asked for a room with   independent beds the room was big enough for the   beds and we slept well the location of the hotel is very good close to subway and there is a walk only street near the hotel where we found a lot of interesting restaurants and shops liquor prices baileys irish cream is way too expensive compared to premium whiskeys ie   oz of irish cream sells for   eur compared to   oz of glemorange whiskey   eur knowing that that bottle of whiskey costs   times the bottle of irish cream dosage price should be reviewed relatively cleanliness staff breakfast the price of a bottle of wine in the bar was ridiculous   euros great family room duplex appt very good staff fantastic tv s in the room on both levels no negative the metro metropolatain only a minute from the hotel great staff friendly and helpful hotel has a great restaurant and there are   restaurants only one street away food is very expensive and parking at hotel is   euro a night which i find way over priced for staying in the hotel gym is extremely small could do with more leisure facilities especially with kids overall it was a lovely hotel clean and tidy lovey rooms location was great with bercy village close round the corner we got the king duplex and was a good size breakfast downstairs was great staff are fantastic they did not change the bed sheets for the   nights and not able the cab park next to the main entrance i fell in the stones of the entrance staff was very gentile location is far from central paris i lost my charging cable for my camera inside our room melanie was very helpful julian was friendly animated no negative staff was friendly and helpful manager showed us to our room on check in our room was up graded at check in because a room at the level we had requested was not yet available we were treated lavishly during our entire stay could not have asked for more room not set up for a woman unable to use hairdryer in bathroom assume for safety reasons so i had to plug it in by the desk no mirror near any of the outlets so had to use my facetime camera on my computer to look at myself while i dried my hair located in a business center neighborhood while there is a metro line close by that goes straight into town without stops that s no substitution for being able to walk out the hotel and take a wander in the neighborhood that would not be recommended in this location not scenic and sidewalks walkways especially difficult along the seine unless you have business very close by this would not be the hotel for you gare de lyon is an arduous   minute walk if you walk fast and it s really difficult if you re hauling a suitcase even if it s small of note when using booking com you will not receive loyalty points you only get the points if you book directly that is really low bed super comfortable staff friendly complimentary water in mini bar nice shower quiet very strong air freshener smell in hallway on our floor room bed pillows wifi shower were great location a bit out of town central area yet still close enough for easy access lots of hip restaurants nearby at bercy village no negative the staff at the reception and the security were very pleasant when we arrived the housekeeping has been very helpful the location is a bit off from the center of paris but there are still a lot to see and we can have good meals at various restaurant at the bazaar our stay was too short spacious room with extra large and comfortable bed large bathroom with excellent rain shower above bath with plenty of hot water all you can eat breakfast included in room price catered for all tastes and the largest of appetites little oversights here and there we were a group of three friends staying in one room but the extra bed didn t get made with the same fabulous comforter and they only provided one robe and slippers for the three of us upon request an extra blanket was provided but not a proper comforter and i m sure we could have gotten extra robes as well if we had asked another friend stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with a nespresso machine but the room hadn t been stocked with nespresso pods and it required a call to the front desk a very good place overall as i said it was just little things here and there that keep it from getting an even better score great breakfast buffet a bit of everything bercy village is a cute little neighborhood with a great variety of restaurants to chose from and very easy to hop on metro to get to all the sites tv in main room didn t work lamp in main room didn t work lighting wasn t the greatest broken lamp taken into consideration fridge wasn t stocked up daily valuable item of clothing went missing from our room staff were really helpful on arrival and made the checking in process a straight forward one even took the time to show us an alternative room on arrival tables for two at breakfast are a little too close but if you are in a bigger party you are more likely to be seated at one of the circular tables in the centre of the room bar service is extremely slow on our third visit we actually gave up waiting this is the second time we have stayed here and consider its location excellent it is on the edge of bercy village and just a couple of hundred metres away from a metro stop making it easy to get around on this occasion we had travelled out to watch france v england at le stade we were upgraded on arrival from superior to deluxe which was obviously appreciated although i m not certain how the rooms differed other than the free soft drinks mini bar the room was light spacious and spotlessly clean and the large bed afforded us two extremely comfortable nights sleep we managed to secure a deal with breakfast included which obviously made it better value choices available are extensive so i defy anyone to not find something that appeals on arrival despite booking a superior double room we were given a twin room on valentine s day when we went back to reception to tell them they had made a mistake the receptionist s quick solution was to say can we push them together for you top marks for thinking on he feet but no eventually got given a different room two floors down the bathroom towels were stained and dirty marks on the ceiling in the bathroom room service was very slow and the champagne glass had a chip which was very sharp we were informed breakfast was served until     on checking however on monday when going down to the restaurant at     we were ushered away saying they were closed as they were only open until   at the weekend   per person the iron in the room was broken this was replaced but the old one didn t get removed and got kept in the corner of the room hoping this was only a one off great location close to the metro line i have seen   hours after your confirmation that you wrote nonsmokers preferred therefore i wrote promptly a mail to you direct to your mailadress with the exakt name and date of booking and i want both rooms f r smokers sorry to say i did not receive any answer when we arrived the booked rooms habe not been available at     and not the following days and they habe been nonsmokers from your really friendly personal i received no comment to this all other services have been pleasent and professional no positiveno negative staff were incredibly friendly an helpful rooms were spacious and comfortable breakfast best o any hotel so far location and proximity to metro superb paper cups for tea coffee facilities asked for better cups twice both times where given more paper cups no fresh milk no creamer asked again was given more coffee sachets at these rates i expected better surrounding area is really nice i e bercy village staff where very friendly food was excellent nothing i chose this hotel as it was close to bercy arena the trip was to see tennis at this venue an added bonus was that the tennis players were also staying there too price of food and drink very high breakfast although a good choice the hot food was luke warm to cold there was a mouse running around the bar location good close to bercy village metro etc staff very helpful and knowledgeable room spacious clean there s just one elevator to reach the gym   level no stairs and it might therefore take a while in busy times when everybody is going to upper floors amazing breakfast to expensive for valley parking dirty room small gym nothing like the picture cold food at the breakfast the staff is amazing lucky hotell to have them heating didn t work in room problems with wifi tv didn t turn on minimal assistance from staff in response to queries about sightseeing etc mistake in check in info supposed to incl breakfast beautiful hotel in charming neighbourhood not much to dislike i stayed there in third week of september along with my wife the hotel is just a five minutes walk from the metro station and there are a lot of restaurants nearby in bercy village the staff was very helpful and gave us valuable tips while going for sightseeing in paris also i would highly recommend mr thomas one of the guys at the reception who has very helpful with our check in and other requests the hotel is value for money no negative the location was great if you are not comfortable driving into the city center which i wasn t it s literally just off the autoway and a short   minute metro ride to everything in paris there are many restaurants and a metro station within a   minute walk from the property we were in room   facing south and the main road very very noisy staff were so friendly especially alessio on reception and eric at breakfast time front desk staff was incompetent we had friends and family calling the hotel to get in touch with us but the front desk operator gave info to our friends that we had not arrived yet and that our reservations where canceled and that there where no body in that name at the hotel in spite of us staying at the hotel wrong information was passed on he also had no clue who the guests where totally unfit for the job good quality rooms it was very noisy in our room due to traffic noise the staff were welcoming and friendly the hotel was clean and had lovely fresh flowers everywhere the lifts were efficient i have stayed there   times before there seems to be no record or continuity no way that they recognised me as being a customer who had stayed several times before that was disappointingno positive we had a double room in a corner of the floor that was large enough but only with a small door sized window in the corner room   if i remember well this was not as booked online nice modern hotel situated next to the major highway autoways with also a metro station close to the station friendly staff and nice quiet room with good soft beds very good breakfast a little far from city center front desk people alice and claire worked to resolve room issues fast great breakfast and very well run operations if you need a real hotel and don t mind a   minute ride to the center of city this is the place they have to add more items for the breakfast the staff are so nice and specially the lady who was serving us the breakfast for the  days she s the best one location is super we booked   separate rooms through booking com this had not been communicated correctly with the hotel and only one room was ready on arrival the staff were very apologetic and dealt with this straight away there was then confusion on check out as to if the room had been paid for we didn t have any nice views from either of our rooms the location of the hotel is in a business district type area the staff were very friendly and helpful and excellent with the children the hotel was on the edge of the city but with easy traveling distance to all attractions no negative have stayed here a few times now really good base to visit paris really comfortable and great location with good connection to central paris good staff and really comfy bed only staying for three days this was our second visit to the hotel and it was as good as i remembered very friendly and helpful staff wonderful food and well presented and maintained room as we had our two children this time we were on the top floor in a duplex suite and the views where excellent located two minutes walk from the bars restaurants and shops of bercy village and cour st emilion metro station it was ideal for evening meals and getting around paris quickly no negative the staff are helpful and friendly the buffet breakfast had a lot of options evening there were a lot of guests the hotel was quiet and did not feel crowded would have been nice to have a pool within the hotel everything interiors are beautiful sauna and gym rooms are nicely displayed and the service was amazing the wifi in the rooms could be improved the signal was very weak in our room this hotel was really great the room a suite was perfect for travelling with young children the room had an upstairs bed room and the pull out bed downstairs was perfect for the kids there is a metro station   minutes from hotel the breakfast was really good with lots on offer for everyone it helped to keep us going for the day this is a hotel we will be back to no negative very good breakfast good and helpful staffs   mins walk from metro station if you know how to get there clean and big room easy to find sth to eat around hotel everything okay i like it s connecting room facility bed pillows rain shower and ironing facility it s location near bercy village subway station overall everything available what a traveller need no negative it s a really lovely hotel modern clean and really helpful friendly staff a great location as it s just a couple of minutes walk from the metro and the bercy village boutique shops and good value restaurants with outside dining a little bit of heaven reprieve from the hustle and bustle of gorgeous paris the sofa cum bed was uncomfortable for the kids to sleep the rain shower is the bedroom upstairs is too close to the wall kept banging my head into the hand shower location is a bit off for leisure travelers well kept clean and cheerful well trained staff with great attitude no negative the bed has a small part of the iron stick out and cut out small part of the leg when we walked near by the bedside the staff said it was like that finally we ask them to cover with a small sponse on top of it we have been reserved in certainly adult   rooms when i went in the afternoon at   pm in hotel that there was only bed for two person in the room although many times expressed in desk and on the phone i want to room change for   persons as the contract but it did not have to change even after been eating dinner there is no subject to change at all i m very angry so i said why do you sell this room tricked into three rooms to two room for me finally changed the room for   persons contain in extrabed but heartfelt apology is not visible it is very uncomfortable experience to me about paris no positive it is not near the places for tourists but with metro using it you can come over this problem location good a lot of restaurants around the hotel cinema cafes shops metro station grocery shop also not too far from hotel rooms are wide very good space free to move around also the shower and toilet and of course i should not forget the staff are very good the food and alcoholic drinks were so overpriced that it was actually cheaper to eat and drink in nightclubs and high end restaurants than at the hotel the breakfast buffet constantly ran out of cutlery glasses and soft drinks often they were never replaced until the staff were asked the rooms had very low wardrobe space and hardly any clothing hangers some rooms had international plug sockets while others did not some rooms had windows that could be opened while others did not nice clean rooms and space with a kettle bottled water and hot drinks restocked daily nice en suite bathrooms with a great shower very friendly helpful and polite multilingual staff very chic lobby and outdoor areas great breakfast buffet food an electronic safe and mini fridge were provided in each room good location walking distance to bercy village and cour st milion metro a member of our group drove to the hotel the price was advised as   upon arrival the fee was   on the machine and then he was charged just short of   even though the concierge advised that he would not pay this i will be in contact with the hotel regarding this excessive charge on a minor i was disappointed that soy milk was not available at the breakfast the hotel staff were great super friendly very accommodating the breakfast had a great selection no negative the staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating to us they upgraded my friends room as it was his stag do and gave us some free shots when we arrived at the bar i would definitely come le back here again the water was very slow for a bath it took for ever to get enough water for a bath the friendliness of the staff very clean no negative close to the arena beds very comfortable kids appreciated the water and sugary stuff at the entrance staff very kind and helpfulno negative the hotel the staff and location are fantastic quiet gracious room i felt very safe at this hotel i am glad that i spent my holiday here no negative the service was excellent and would recommend this location as its got great connectivity and good restaurants at the bercy village no negative food was excellent the staff was fantastic very friendly makes you feel welcome at all time very helpful keep up the good work no negative staff were so helpful the rooms and hotel were very clean and had all the facilities we would want i would highly recommend no negative location is near to food area and five guys is walking distance price is reasonable as well walking distance to metro station no restaurants for lunch and dinner the shower room design is bad it made the bath room wet when used n convenient and quiet no negative just outside of all the major site seeing areas in paris with easy links to metro bercy village great places to eat parking was very good no thing so clean helpful and so friendly staff spacious rooms very good smell at lifts and corridors nearby metro station and good restaurants the scrambled eggs on march  th good location near bercy village and park the breakfast was extensive unfortunately the scrambled eggs were cold we waited for more than   minutes to check out they should consider to add more staff good location the staff are helpful we like take bus but here only bus   a little bit unconvinced nice breakfast close to the   subway safe area a lot of food choose nothing special location accessible to whole of paris and out of the busy area for calm rest staff was good and well manneredno negative as soon as you arrived the staff made you feel very welcome the rooms are spacious and comfy great location near a tube stationno negative the staff where very friendly and willing to help i loved the chilling area and the food is so tasty audrey was so lovely price of food the service here was amazing i have already recomended this hotel to   people was amazing and will be going back the room is so small it is not like in the picture however we are used with rooms in paris the elevator stops at the middle of   floors so you have to walk up or down to access your room it is quite strange with us this hotel is a boutique hotel so everything look old but it works as normal the location is very nice easy go to louvre museum many restaurants nearby and you can find some local coffee shop in the morning the staff is really helpful and friendly mini fridge was missing shower is a bit tired and room had absolutely ugly color very nice location the district is clean and quite close to the metro   min walk bed was comfortable and cozy the elevator stops at strange half floors so no matter which floor you re getting off at you have to take a few steps up down on a narrow staircase to get to your room the location is close to   nearby metros that can get you pretty much anywhere withing     mins not the most central but its a quiet and safe neighborhood there s a really good cafe down the street called beans on fire expensive breakfast buy it on the coffee roastery at the corner of the park instead great nearby restaurants very popular so make sure to book at least fri sat super cosy area small room and the chairs made it smaller fact were no hooks in bathroom no herbal tea and no tea cups or mugs clean towelling gown and slippers provided balcony that overlooked the park helpful and friendly staff having tea and coffee making facilites in the room very comfortable bed frankly we don t understand how this hotel has a   star label this should be   at most rooms are very small the hotel itself is a bit old the elevator stops between floors so you still have to take a few steps and it is also ridiculously small we could not fit   people with our two suitcases and we are small oh and wifi was terribly slow as well it s located in a quiet and safe area the staff is very nice reception staff grumpy very poor breakfast not at all a   star level hotel the hotel is located in a wonderful square and some rooms have a balkony overlooking the park it s probably the paris standard but the triple room was incredibly small overpriced like hell nice location near a park but we couldn t open the window because there was no space the small size of lift and the lift stops in the middle of   floors needing to take stairs some heavy luggages all good except for teo things very near gare de lyon dark in corridors and small stairs very small room selected and paid for a double room but got a single room no security chain on inside bedroom some of the staff at reception or breakfast staff almost inexistant disappointing for a   star hotel it is a good   but not   great location room with balcony with view on the park breakfast was ridiculous if staying at the hotel please don t pay for breakfast as you will be disappointed there is a fabulous restaurant around the corner from the hotel two minute walk it s called vertigo the food was great staff were friendly the hotel was very clean the hotel is in a good location and very easy to find overall it s a nice hotel but be aware of the very small bedrooms and bathroom i called down for a charger and iron the man on reception asked me to come collect it i explained i was in pj s and he said what do you want me to do then another man walked into my room at the crack of dawn used a key so presumed must have been staff but this woke me up and obviously was quite frightening i told reception the next day and she seemed particularly unmoved by this simply said he must of been staff finally as we left the staff were standing right outside the hotel entrance smoking generally unprofessional quite rude and would not recommend no positive no negative comments location was perfect right in the center but near a lovely park and in a quiet neighbourhood one sunny morning we even had croissants with coffee on our little terrace the room was extremely small it would have been acceptable as a single room but not as a double room the bed was extremely small and it was attached to the wall on one side and a small passage on the other side i am not sure how it can be called a double room nothing breakfast was a little chaotic got down   minutes before it finished but we had to ask for all the basics as it was v poorly replenished airco didnt work so bed room was really very hot the bathroom was tiny which is to be expected in paris but was just one more thing close to the metro adorable staff our doggie stayed for free coffee in room good toiletries for the price i could not find fault the rooms were small but excellent bathrooms nice powerful shower big towels and robes and even slippers tea and coffee making available as well as a tiny balcony to take the morning air rooms too small for  rd bed which was a rather uncomfortable sofa bed leaving no space to lay out a suitcase parking was difficult clean and functional well located the rooms were small but functional if you are looking for lots of room to spread out this hotel is probably not the best choice if you are going to see the sights and just need a clean comfortable place to sleep this is a great option since we had a toddler it was slightly cramped but that is my only complaint the staff was friendly and very helpful we requested a crib for our toddler and it was in our room with nice linens and a toddler pillow when we checked in which was nice the room we took was a bit small for   people but was big enough all the same the staff were very helpful at all times there are also about   good restaurants within   minutes walk from the hotel cleanliness i must say is about   super clean toilets shower etc the pictures i got in my reservation do not belong to the room i got i reserved a superior room and it was quite small i asked the receptionist what is superior in my room and she told me that is the view to the park that makes it superior i felt disappointed it took hours to the staff to prepare scrumble eggs location no negative there are many restaurants and markets nearby staff is really kind and helpfull if you have a baby and stroller choosing bus   instead of metro is easier to travel around not conveniently located from the airport or in to central paris it is eother   in a taxi to central paris or a   min walk the room was unbelievably small and it comfortable for three people in the family room i paid   for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located the fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine we were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off from then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive overall i was very disappointed with the hotel please don t stay here the ensuite shower was lovely and had a decent shower the value for the money wasn t that well the location wasn t good for the money the room was tiny it was near to a metro station and had good wifi please booking personal must be check all things then presents they in to booking web sit honestly in site wrote about the single bed but we saw it is sofa and it wasn t comfortable for may dad no negative the rooms were very small and not very ideal staying with one other person and we were practically on top of one another had to shout out when going from bathroom to bedroom incase someone was behind the door not good tea of coffee making facilities but the room and hotel was very clean and in a great location and good value for money no negative everything about this boutique hotel was wonderful the breakfast was delicious and fresh each morning all staff incredibly friendly and helpful also very welcoming and sweet with our daughter within about   minutes of arriving i already wanted to extend our stay the beds were so comfortable and the area so calm it felt like we got a genuine insight into parisian day to day life also there are so many off the beaten track sights to see close by definitely recommend looking into those we also walked to the baticlan area which was really great also there s a bakery very close by with delicious in house made produce and a great pizza restaurant just   minutes walk from the hotel the owner so lovely and fantastic food too can t wait to return the pillows are very soft which i don t like and there isn t any milk in the room if you have a craving for a cuppa after a long day the location is good rue saint maur is a nice neighbourhood quite chilled out so you get a decent night s sleep but there are a couple of nice bars and places to eat very closeby not too touristy area but also easy to hop on the metro to get to those areas quickly would stay in this area again the room was small with a disappointment view it was on the  st floor but it felt like a basement we had the view of a wall and all the air air conditioners outside in the silence at night we could only hear that annoying sound of them working cleanness friendly staff only a welcome information about the surrounding area would have been really appreciated the check in and check out procedures were smooth it was really clean in a super great and safe district the room was spacious for our needs the location was pretty central through which you can reach anywhere once you are familiar with the directions the room was a little smaller than we thought we did have a lot of luggage the location may be a little far out for a first timer who wants to walk out of their hotel into the thick of things in central paris the hotel was clean and well put together the staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to make dinner reservations for us and to make recommendations the location was good for us with some interesting restaurants and cafes in the local area and an easy train ride into the centre of paris we have been to paris many times so being in the  st arr was not critical for us could hear people talking outside until   am every morning had to open window because room is too hot room was very small along with tiny bathroom probably could have found a better hotel for the price friendly and helpful staff bakery and grocery store across the street tea bags needed renewing but this a minor point small shower room and a large person might squeeze but well planned with everything needed wide choice at breakfast coffee excellent delicious altogether responsive helpful staff a good coffee machine would have been great help yourself fruit as you walked in friendly staff and they recommended a good restaurant for me all on my lonesome no negative it s a nice hotel nice room good atmosphere and friendly staff it s about     minute walk to the metro line   and     bus lines surrounded i am happy to stay here industrial extra small croissant no proper breakfast area breakfast is served in the reception area with uncomfortable inappropriate chairs sofas and tables very limited choice of breakfast items espresso is charged extra only   french tv channels great location quiet city centre in walking distance comfortable well equipped except tv room and modern bathroom no negative comfortable bed with clean linnen water boiler in room shower in good order fresh towels the room was ready and we could check in some hours earlier than ordinary check in time thank you rooms are a bit on the small side but very comfy and clean staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble and spoke very good english which was a bonus noisy heating the bathroom was nice but there should have been at least a table in there you have nowhere to put your stuff high quality breakfast not a vast choice but the essentials and everything delicious and top level if you have a car parking around gardette square is not the hassle that you can have in some other areas the area is very relaxed good bed slightly cramped room had to duck past tv to get to loo in the night friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast well connected location balcony onto nice park breakfast could be improved with fresh products and real coffee good location in a lively part of paris very quiet streets with restaurants nearby reasonable size for the rooms which have been renovated and well maintained the room is small but it is paris after all it is not accessible to people with disabilities or people with infants and strolls the breakfasts is ok but too simple and not french authentic the public transportation is well connected to the hotel location for the major sights of paris the staff is very helpful and kind clean room and comfortable bed reception wasn t good place i didn t like their responding the lobby was quite small there were no television in there anybody doesn t help you to carry your luggage and show your way the escalator was horrible it was like an service escalator only two persons can enter in it esclator doesn t go to your level you have to climb the stairs with your luggage coridor of flat was very narrow there was no refrigerator in your room if you want anything your room they don t bring you there is no room service they say you come and take yourself the tv shows only french channels the breakfast was insufficient i didn t understand how this hotel rated     points l defently don t suggeste this hotel for staying cleaning was good breakfast was little bit expensive this hotel is in a nice location very near to the metro station hotel is clean and the staff is nice too the price paid for this hotel was worth i highly recommend it no negative it was a very pleasant stay here the room we got was very clean and modern we had a little balcony  th floor which was very nice you can darken the room very well the bathroom was spacious very rare for paris the elevator though was very very small but i think this is rather a detail the staff was very helpfull and friendly you can leave your luggage in the hotel as you checkout and you still want to discover paris we didn t took the breakfast at the hotel the hotel is located in a very good neighbourhood of paris the distance to the nearest metrostation is not close but nor far either you have a little supermarket in the neighbourhood this hotel is recommended no negative the quiet location of this hotel but still very centrally located in paris the reception staff was very friendly and helpfull haven t seen xavier without a smile love the decoration in the hotel room lobby and all other areas i almost had a heart attack when someone walked into my room at  am they didn t knock they just opened the door it was very scary the hotel didn t seem very concerned about the situation and i had to practically drag an excuse out of them the location surprised that for that price there was no mini bar and the furnishings were unremarkable nice to have balcony overlooking the park and we found an excellent cafe restaurant and wine bar all extremely close to the hotel elevator stopped mid floor so it was necessary to walk up or down flight of stairs with luggage staff exceptionally helpful and accommodating twin bedded room small and shower not made for large people the room is quite small but this is paris you won t get a large room here the elevator is also really small but it gets the job done the staff was nice and polite we got a room on an upper floor just as required with a nice view to the park the room was clean and the bed was very comfy wi fi works great the neighborhood is ok and the metro station is at about   minutes walk the lift was extremely small and transporting suitcases pushchairs up and down from our room was a bit of a pain the staff were extremely helpful and lovely to our children it was brilliant having the park just over the road and there were great cafes brasseries within walking distance not enough light to use the mirror in the bathroom for makeup and nowhere else suitable used compact mirror in the end but it us not comfortable only   tea bags the receptionist provided more on request though the staff were wonderful and the room was nice with a large bathroom the kettle and tea were nice the colour of the paintwork and walls was very dark in the room we had and the lighting quite poor especially for reading no telephone in room and we had to ask for coffee and milk each day as this was not provided only tea bags bathroom very clean and towels very clean bed a little small for a double but the bedding very clean and white quiet area so sleeping was not an issue easy access to the metro no problems just a bit of confusion over some extras on our bill in french which were quickly and efficiently sorted out our second time at the gardette it s a perfectly positioned and comfortable oasis in the centre of paris would go back anytime not getting pick pocketed on the metro in the first five minutes of arriving in paris the rooms were small but clean and comfortable the location was good the breakfast was very good and worth the cost drink making facilities paper cups provided for hot drinks only one teabag provided at a time no milk unless requested no information provided in room about hotel facilities or nearby ameneties good quiet location and very helpful friendly staff the photos of the room were not reflective at all of the actual room were in there were stains on the sheets rooms were extremely small staff were friendly grumpy staff at check in in paris i ve had similar facilities room size and amenities and closer to metro for   lower price lovely location on a green quiet square very clean pleasant staff at check out very good wifi breakfast could contain more protein and please serve fresh boiled eggs every morning old ones taste bad but otherwise great experience and we will return silent hotel nicely decorated rooms good location no milk to accompany the tea and coffee making facilities provided in the room until we asked quiet location superior double room overlooked gardette park friendly and helpful staff on front desk very good choice of bars and restaurants in immediate vicinity there was nothing not to like perfect hotel for the price the staff are friendly the clearners are nice and go the extra mile i felt like i had to leave a tip the hotel is overlooking a nice park and isn t too far from the metro room had everything you could possible need clean and modern the smell upon our arrival probably coming from the bath hotel was very small rooms also but it was ok location design coziness street view park opposite of the hotel specialty coffee around the corner with nice english speaking staff free wi fi in the hotel calm and relaxing atmosphere very small rooms although contain key things one migh need breakfast is overpriced however tasty it is vegetarian predominantely continental so might be too small for those expecting full breakfast really nice location outside of the main tourist areas but good connections cosy bars and restaurants in the vicinity very nice receptionist who gave us good tips on where to eat only one english speaking tv channel and that was us news no clothes storage except hanging no drawers or shelves paper cups for coffee had to buy our own we liked the views over the park and the spacious suite first time in hotel i was told that i will get the room which has no view from window and has other problems just becouse i had discount for early booking nothing helped to change the room even that it was my birthday day they didn t even say happy birthday bathroom was very cold and smell not good and a lot more no positive the bathroom was freezing cold and no heating could reach it the breakfast is not worth paying for ugh no greens and all sugar good location between the major metro lines and tidy efficient rooms great bed trendy oberkampf caf s pubs and restaurants just around the corner the best location to stay at in paris no negative very polite and helpful personnel the owner gave us instructions on how to see the best of paris in a timely manner our room was very clean and had a nice view facing a small park no negative all staff were very helpful and friendly they allowed me to use the microwave to sterilise my babies bottles and provided us with a cot and storage for the pushchair downstairs overnight so we didn t have to carry it upstairs couldnt of wished for a more no negative we stay often in this hotel because we enjoy the area slightly away from the centre but having easy access to the metro and buses the hotel is next to a small parc plus there are many good restaurants nearby a new employer unable to do her job at the reception was nasty to me it was the days of the terror and i asked if the trains were leaving to italy or not cause they said frontiers were going to be closed she answered to me that she was busy hotel was in fact empty cause all afraid they left and that it was not her business to phone or find a solution for me i never found a concierge like this and i have travelled for more thans   years she even said that dogs are not welcomee there and that i cannot come back with them so i called the other genius employer named moussa in his day off and he helped me in every one of my doubts and solved all the problems this unpolite inefficient unprofessional caused all is fantastic in this hotel they are very gentle i am a recurrent guest for many years now i even come with three little dogs and they are well accepted the clenaing with alina was perfect in my room in spite of dogs only at breakfast is fruit is missing and also a fridge in the room would be perfect the room was small the bathroom was very small you barely can wash without opening the door the window was pointing to a wall the bed was really big the cleaningno negative great area with lots of restaurants and cafes and public transport options a short walk from the richard lenoir pousse the hotel itself is friendly and compact loved our little balcony overlooking the park nice breakfast too room was quite small drab colour scheme although tidy the room could do with a brighter colour this would also make the room appear bigger good location around  m from the nearest metro station good selection of restaurants within a few minutes walk clean recently updated bathroom the rooms are pretty small with very little space to cross from one side of the room to the other the elevator stops between the levels and therefore the rooms are to reach only by stairs the next metro station is several minutes to walk very well situated hotel close to gardette park in a quiet street nice staff all necessary facilities and services are close to the hotelno negative peaceful location overlooking a pretty little park yet close to a number of good cafes and restaurants ideal for visiting our student son living nearby we were upgraded as we had mentioned when booking through booking com that it was also a special wedding anniversary we had a lovely corner suite with   large windows and a good sized bathroom room came with tea and coffee but no coffee and no milk had to go to reception both mornings to get milk but other than that it was great not touristy at all loved the feel of staying in a real area of paris lovely bathroom sitting on our balcony and seeing families leave the restaurant across the road on sunday afternoon was delightful the breakfast room is in the same floor as front desk which is very small i had to wait for a while to get a table calm area of paris overlooking a small park called gardette nicely decorated rooms not a lot of interesting restaurants within easy walking distance but a very friendly bar on the corner we had a large corner room with balcony and were within easy walking distance of metro saint ambroise   line and   bus which goes to many of the major attractions hotel was very clean and staff was helpful breakfast buffet was relatively inexpensive and included all the basics coffee juice croissants cheese hard boiled eggs cereal yogurt jam fruit breakfast is really basic and could be improved easily good location with convenient access to subway station quite environment and rooms with reasonnable size for paris very clean and confortable the hotel was very noisy people stood on the landings and chatted well into the evening and the doors let the sound in as though they weren t there also the room was very hot at night but if the windows were open the noises from the neighbourhood were so loud the location in the  th was close to several metro stops and there were a number of good restaurants in the neighbourhood great shower pretty comfortable bed breakfast could be improved easily as it is very very basic nice room with good facilities very clean and confortable very quite environment with a view on a public gardenno negative for s shirt stay in paris this is an exceny hotel and very well position away but at the same time close to all the main attractions rooms are small but functionalno negative the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel is close to transport links local facilities and is within easy walking distance of much of paris we walked every day and discovered some beautiful areas not on the main tourist trails the paris of the parisians even the hotel have a sound proof but i still can hear other customers banging their door it is a bit dark in the room the two spot lights were bright but installed on the top of one side of the room two beside lamps are too dim it is in quiet location friendly staff and very clean room more breakfast options please bed was confortable always clean towels location close to all front desk mrs helena friendly always willing to help with my adventure through paris yes i will recommend gardette park hotel no negative the hotel was in a great location really close to the metro   lines one of which goes straight to gare du nord the room we had was small but well laid out so that it was not a problem it was also very clean and comfy would recommend room small but great value and we were only in the room to sleep so how big does it need to be great location easy access to the metro very quiet at night so a good nights sleep in a very comfy bed with excellent air con a short walk to bars and restaurants in proper paris very few tourists but a great location to hop on the metro to see all the sights would definitely stay again no negative the staff very friendly and easy to approach we booked two rooms and travelled with small baby and the lady at the reception was so kind to allocate us and my parents on the same floor she saw us coming with the baby stroller and accommodate us in a bigger corner room with more space i would definitely recommend that hotel if you are visiting paris with a small baby the hotel rooms are really quiet and no noise from the street or neighbouring rooms there is also a lift very tiny but that s paris so you should be happy to have one at all lovely quiet street overlooking the park nice design very clean probably   min walk from the nearest metro station but we used it once as we walked pretty much everywhere very comfortable bed location is good if you not looking for a very busy part of paris but close to bastille or nation if i would be visiting paris again i would book that hotel for sure again wifi really good my parents had much smaller room but with a sofa their toilet was much smaller and the only comment from my dad was that if there would be bigger person than it would be quiet difficult for them to turn around in that toilet or get into shower but hey it s paris and we liked the place and we fitted in the toilet lol double bed was not accessible from both sides fixed against the wall making it difficult for two people to use staff failed to acknowledge our arrival us with a basic greeting despite us saying good evening and bon soir they also failed to respond to a personal request for some ice after reluctantly agreeing they walked off and never returned leaving us baffled disappointed quiet and clean location   mins walk from bastille and direct bus service to gare du nord stairs are very steep and the lifts stop between floors so access with heavy luggage or reduced mobility is a bit awkward nice location tucked away off parmentier and handy for voltaire st maur metro comfortable quiet and a nice experience i really appreciated the free magazines and newspapers french language some staff clearly needed more training regarding the operation of the hotel and general organization located in what seems to be a safe neighborhood just a short walk from st ambroise metro station and good value for money everything was good nothing to complain about really hallways a little small so big or really heavy people may feel less accomodated great restaurants on either side of park cool area like  s east village noisy can hear guests banging doors of their rooms all the time twice the housekeeping opened the door and came in room once while i was in shower and once while i was changing no positive perhaps the little bathroom in the could be problem for bigger guests in the heart of the lively  th arrondissement of paris hotel is situated in a calm side street opposite a little park very charming hotel friendly staff no problems at all staff brilliant location good quiet but handy for everything rooms clean and comfy we recommend this hotel for all round value and service the wifi a bit hit and miss the staff were lovely the breakfast was good and the room though small was clean and pleasant liked everything loved the size of the room the huge balcony was amazing with seating and across from the park size of the bathroom was nice too our room was rather small and the aircon failled one night fully deserved   stars   min walk to the metro nice neighbourghood no negative very sweet picturesque hotel next to a park tasty breakfast and warm staff we had a wonderful time with our small children at this hotel nothing the bed was extra comfy and the staff were very kind the place was clean and there were a lot of boulangeries around rooms doors are very very bad it makes noisy sound like hell when it is closed cleanliness is perfect room is very good the wi fi connection was a bit slow the room was small clean quiet and   minutes walk from the metro station nice staff no negative very nice and comfortable hotel with paris spirit park view is excellent sun in the morning looking into windows is beautiful bed too short if you are tall this place is not for you bathroom really small position cleanliness rooms are newly renovated quite soft beds everything was perfect it s a clean and well maintained hotel in a perfect location to explore paris the rooms have a nice view over the garden we never made it to the full breakfast when we got up everything except the fruits and cheese was gone the room was niceno negative great location away from the touristy madness yet close enough to enjoy the city very helpful and friend staff a good hotel for enjoying paris you can hear people from other rooms loud and clear i couldn t sleep after  am after the other guests woke up the first guy on the reception was rude and unhelpful location good view clean room and clean bathroom air conditioner ventilation is good on the top  th floor as our room   had windows facing in   different directions however room   e g facing just one side was kind of stuffy the staff was friendly and helpful when making a booking i added a couple of special requests   the room to face away from the street and   have   twin beds when we checked in both requests have been ignored although the concierge could see them in his system so next day after my complaining they readily moved us to another room which again did not satisfy either of the two criteria but was now on the top floor higher up above the street noise go figure i really apreciate the advise i got ftom mohammad to be at the airport earlier it turned out that indeed the lines and the wait at cdg were horrendous there is an ajacent restaurant that serves fine complementary breakfast the staff there is also very friendly for other meals prices are a bit too high for the value another plus is that this hotel is a long walk await from montmartre the beds were very comfortable the walls are thin so it was possible to hear a lot of what was happening in the neighbouring room very cozy and pleasant hotel nice staff and great rooms the elevator there are only   elevators one of each only reach up to level   and the other one is able to reach up to level   but the one which can go to high levels is so small and only able to fit   persons it also uses for the housekeepers you need luck to be able to use the elevator yummy pain au chocolate nice staffs clean room nothing the staff went over and above for us before we had even checked in the female manager was a joy to deal with the detail in the room is just to die for it s a great area with lots to do within walking distance nothing everything fantastic room on the  th floor spacious comfortable bed staff is always very nice and location is perfect everytime i go to paris i try to book this hotel the cleanliness of the bathroom could be improved and the shower was way too small for me great design of the room which was very cosy loved the atmosphere in the hotel nice products in the bathroom and the location is right in the center of the trendy paris with many bars and restaurants aroundno negative we were able to visit most places on foot but metro is only a   minutes walk away good breakfast in relaxed atmosphere just ask for coffee and everything else is self service fresh bread and croissants good shower pressure great burger place just opposite and tasty crepes at the top of the road though chambre de bonne was very cosy we could not walk up straight in the room because of the beams we also missed a proper wardrobe with hangers and some hooks for coats extremely helpfull staff charming hotel great beds the wifi was slow and sometimes we were unable to use it the staff where welcoming and friendly and our room always got nicely cleaned reception staff very helpful we d appreciate if the staff hadn t referred to us as madamemonsieur we are two guys even though it s a habit obviously we got the most beautiful room with four windows facing the streets of paris wonderful views the staff is very friendly the bed is comfortable we had a great time cleanliness they didn t clean the used coffee cups from previous guest very nice interior design of the hotel very convenient location and safe neighborhood the shower room is small so water could be everywhere location is excelent staff very helpfull my room has a balcony so my husband could smoking out there we had an unpleasant experience when getting breakfast i was traveling with my   year old mother we arrived just at the end of the breakfast hour and although the buffet was still out were told we had to leave which seemed ridiculous as people were still eating and food was there in front of us my mother is very unsteady on her feet and the restaurant manager was totally rude and inconsiderate i complained to management and i believe he was reprimanded they told me that they might offer us a free breakfast the next day but they charged us the manager had changed his attitude though the elevator is tiny and not for the claustrophobic the design is really fun and fresh the beds were very comfortable most of the staff were lovely bathroom was big with a huge tub see above i was very disappointed with the hotel as it had received rave reviews from conde naste traveller magazine the room was basic with no bed side tables the only good thing to say about it is that the very small twin beds were comfortable i would never stay there again wifi wasn t great showers are also tiny not all rooms have showers which could be better communicated online as people expect a shower as standard mini bar is limited and fridge not cold beautifully designed hotel very comfortable staff were friendly and helpful the bathrooms smelt like cabbage and the halls are very narrow so you can hear quite a lot we didn t spend much time in our room but the hotel itself looks very stylish the rooms have lovely decor features although our room is quite basic looking location was nice plenty of restaurants to visit it would be nice if there was coffee served in the lobby served as well as the restaurant is closed during the day loved the design of the hotel the soaps were very nice as well en the bed was lovely narrow bed small windows and dark interior cold bathroom without additional heating low ceiling in the room gives the impression of gloomy room small elevator for   people design service was terrible we asked if we could have a drink in the restaurant which was empty and we were told only if we were eating there was no other place to have a drink we also asked a number of question at reception and were told someone would come back to us which they didn t and finally we were disturbed by other guests who we think had escorts to the hotel and proceeded to keep up the whole hotel with their activities we were on the  th floor friends on  th and other guest we talked to from  nd floor and everyone was disturbed also by the subsequent arguement and intervention of another guest several people were complaining at reception however no discount on the room not even a complimentary breakfast was offered the guy in reception was laughing about it looked nice from the outside very tight space all around shower cubicle not made for bigger people staff is uninterested and borderline arrogant hotel is far from any tourist destinations area not very attractive or interesting if you have a neighbor who smokes your room will also smell of smoke will not return stylish decor one staff who can t speak english it was always tough to communicate with him and sometimes there s only him i appreciate and feel more secure if he can speak english a bit more breakfast here is just amazing good selection stylish desinged restaurant and soft croissan you can t miss it room is cozy but it s enough space always tidy and clean such a well designed and fashionable yes the corridors might be tight but it is paris the bed was great and comfortable value for money is great for paris hotels this is a newly renovated hotel and it was great the shower head in room   needs to be tightened we liked the location good buzz felt safe with many good restaurants and supermarkets close to metro the staff were very welcoming and accommodating the room was small but not tiny and very clean the bed was very comfortable wifi was very good we would definitely return some staff is not good at commnicating in english i asked them not clean my room as i don t prefer someone to enters my room but it was done all day i stayed good location stylish designed room awesome breakfastno negative from the moment we walked in we felt like we were in a dream each design element is so tasteful and we loved the decor furnishings and colours the bed was comfy x   the only downfall was that we had to leave our beautiful room to explore the city the bread ran out at breakfast when i asked for more of the french baguette they told me this was not possible if you can t get a french baguette in france for breakfast where can you no positive the drain in the bath room is very bad when i was taking shower i need to control the water faucet in case the water overflow good location it s very close to opera metro station we stayed in a superior double which was a lovely room but the wet room did not contain the shower water the water went everywhere except for down the drain and flooded onto the carpet in our room resulting in a very rushed shower we got moved to a suite for the following night because of this issue then found that the suite had exactly the same issue carpet drenched tiling needs to be more angled to allow the water to filter to the drain hole we liked the location of the hotel the beds were very comfortable the decor of the rooms was lovely and the hotel felt clean and fresh staff were friendly and spoke good english breakfast was nice enjoyed the croissants no wardrobe only two shelves plus a metal bar without hangers good that i always have a couple in my suitcase light was flickering when turned to the dim mode perfect location between the metro stations grands boulevards and cadet my favourite area of paris with lots of caf s bakeries and food shops cleanness and stylish design of the room very comfortable double bed spacious bathroom with a window nice little balcony room   a kettle and a cup provided upon my request nice and friendly staff great choice for the price nothing it was perfect although the lift is teeny tiny not good for anyone with claustrophobia   ppl were like sardines in it lovely quiet rooms gorgeous design features really comfy bed good size room and bathroom for paris immaculately clean really lovely staff perfect location room sizes in paris are naturally very small the shower area has a very small glass panel and water would fill up the entire bathroom floor as it spilled from the shower area despite a lot of conscious manoeuvring there are no tea or coffee making facilities and i had to buy water from the nearby grocery store location is fantastic surrounded by grocery stores fabulous patisserie round the corner   subway lines and even a famous french bistro chartier the room is beautifully decorated in art deco style and the bed is comfortable eventhough it is located in a busy intersection the windows are sound proof its great to just look out the balcony and watch the world go by staff are friendly helpful and respond well to feedback and requests nothing it has been only   weeks this hotel has started to perform it was really good experience with good staff professional service and unique interior design location is very central rooms are very clean i really recommended this hotel for your paris trip thank you panache team breakfast was too simple the room is fantasy and my friend and i really like the decoration of this hotel it was a nice trip the room was tiny fantastic location great interior for the room close to most things we wanted and it wasn t expensive either noice from next room but can t help it in these old characteristic rooms beautiful room warm and strong shower beautiful spiral staircase overly cool staff rooms not checked for maintenance issues i had to move rooms twice the bed heads and little phones are an instagram dream no negative was over for euro   stayed in nice and lyon hotel panache was superb best stop over for me very impressed with hotel and area loved itno negative one of the best design hotels i ve stayed in wonderful staffs   mins walk to the lourve and centre pompidou first room air conditioning didn t work internet was dreadful last straw was no hot water in the morning for a shower so left a night early for the money was not expecting the ritz but could be better good location and quiet room stayed in the blue quite and wifi and tv didn t work to be fair i did not mention this to management as most of the time we were out and about lift is small   normal people a very large person would likely not fit nor would large luggage with a person leaving stairs as the only option shower bath was oddly missing any side glass sheets to stop splashing water hitting the floor and it lacked a holder for the shower head which made showering fun i guess they assumed everyone would take a bath instead none of these were major issues to me hence still giving a very good rating because everything else was fantastic great location super close to les halles short walk down to the river loads of cafes and restaurants nearby aircon fantastic suite s balcony was fantastic hotel staff super nice rooms comfy good night sleep the hotel decor was a little shabby in the room bathroom was very basic no shower location was perfect for access to centre staff were friendly and helpful wifi was non existent we aren t desparate for it but needed it to organise our next day sightseeing great location on chatalet metro easy for gare du nord and into the city good value for money great for   night stay with two teenagers especially as rooms connected room and bathroom was a bit smaller than i had hoped for no bath as requested when booking the room just a shower the smallest lift i have ever seen it is a   person max or   person with   suitcase bed was very comfy the continental breakfast was good especially the croissants the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the location is spot on right in the centre of paris with easy access to metro rail stations which makes seeing all of paris easy several busy cafes bars in a busy pedestrian street however the double glazed windows really do shut it all out making the room really quiet we were on the  st floor facing   busy cafes rooms were tiny and not what was advertised as per images bathroom was tiny and could not fit a male comfortably wifi was non existent   out of the   receptionists could speak understandable english overall poor experience location was great decor was slightly shabby room was slightly small for the furniture in it helpful and efficient staff very good location particularly once you have found the best exit from the metro many restaurants and bars nearby would especially recommend pizzeria mimmo at   rue saint dennis wifi worked well pure dissapointment i booked the penthouse apartment with a terrace room was dirty the bed on the terrace was missing mattress and lighting was not working when i wanted to contact manager the reception told me that it is a weekend and they are not allowed to give the manager contact number to the guest and they can do nothing they did nothin for   days and never get back to me nothing this time hotel is on very best place because this place is very noisy breakfast was typical for france staff don t speak english breakfast clean underground is  m since the suite is at the top floor we bumped against the low ceiling in the bathroom over the bathtub most of the time a bit hard to find via car gps because rue sainte opportune is not a car accessible road great location the metro station is right in front of the hotel quadruple suite is nice cozy clean and come with all amenities good wifi well if you re on a sightseeing holiday it is vital that you plan your next day feom your hotel room now this was something we couldn t do neither our neighbors from different floors the wifi was absolutely rubbish many people complained including me throughout the   days we spent there but hey reception restarted yhe rooter every time what did not solve the problem promising tje next day it shall be fixed since he s going to pass on our rightful complaint you see we paid for a room with wifi well they didn t manage to fix the problem hence the full house really disappointed could have found a better place for that money the other little problem was that after room service always left with one set of gel and shampoo every day and i ve asked every day for another set one day we only had shampoos not really thoughtful overall cleanliness was good tough excellent location it seemed the room was a little small the shower even smaller you could have used the curtain as a flannel and i am of average build the noise of the revellers during the night was ok but got a bit lively and loud during the small hours use the stairs as the lift is very small bed was comfy the breakfast was a good selection of food hot and cold the hotel was in a lively area poor wifi non existent mostly and room over heated but we could open our window but then got street noise below excellent location right next door to metro chatelet station and easy walking distance to louvre notre dam rooms are small and dirty this is definitely not a four star hotel one has to be extremely careful while booking a room in ducs d anjou a room described as standard room can be   square meters elevator can hardly accommodate two people quality of this property and service offered does not correspond with price the room was small the internet was poor to say the least the bed was comfortable the design of the hotel appealing location good and staff friendly very small room with and very tiny bathroom in thw shower there was a curtain couldn t feel it clean photos don t show what it looks like in real no positive the room given to us very small the shower cubical is so tight and badly designed that all water spills to rest of the bathroom not much of choice of free tea bags and they even not re fill next day of our stay wifi was very poor and slow i would only give full marks to its location location on saturday early morning the rubbish bin cleaners outside were so loud it woke us up and found it hard to go back to sleep wasnt relaxing that morning loved the view clean and comfortable rooms bedroom was quite small for the price i paid however i do believe this is normal for paris this hotel markets itself as a   star and charges four star prices i suspect the french don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star there was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for   minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money location of hotel was good bed was comfortable this hotel is for no reason a   star hotel the room was very small one double bed could hardly fit in the bathroom was very small as well especially the shower the check in was very bureaucratic you need to fill in a whole form with personal details the internet was slow the place for breakfast is on the basement and seems like a cave tle location was the relevant advantage the breakfast was also decent and the bed comfortable enough no negative we had the penthouse suite for the night the views were out of this world the bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on the clouds the view over paris rooftops from the bed was like a dream highly recommend with the penthouse comes a roof top and that is so incredible there was no bar in the hotel not a proper restaurant either facilities weren t that great and the rooms were too small i liked the location and the staff were very friendly and helpful room service not at all attentive mini bar not replaced in   days i had to chase them for soap towels creamer etc florence at reception extra helpfull great location very good breakfast i didn t ask for the breakfast since it was expensive   euro per person but i could buy food from the   supermarkets the hotel assigned me a very small room at the beginning very hot and without ventilation but after the first   days i asked to change it and they gave me a better room i booked the taxi from the hotel to the airport and the driver seemed to know the manager of the staff and i was surprised that for   min driving he charged   euro when i took the taxi from the airport to the hotel i paid   euro for the same trip don t book a taxi with the hotel the location of the hotel was perfect the metro chatelet is only   min walking there are   supermarkets close to the hotel   min the river seine is   min walking where you can take the river cruise notre dome is   min walking and louvre is   min walking could t ask more the staff of the hotel was amazing they were all very sweet and helpful i had asked to have the baby crib and i found it in the room when i reached the hotel it was really noisy not just from the street below but the walls were thin and you could hear the people next door taking a shower or opening their door the location was good really close to the metro and lots of places to eat and drink internet that s the only reason why i won t be back at the hotel once again poor connection i was at the second floor asked several times a day to restart the connection but nothing helped the location was amazing steps from everything you need and wants staff was friendly and mostly helpful nothing really i found everything good i liked my room suite camelia very much it was clean tidy comfortable i slept very well i also liked having breakfast in this hotel i had a good choise about what to eat internet did not work at all the entire stay could not control heat either too cold or too hot the rooms are noisy there s no standing shower just a hand spray in the bath breakfast is a rip off especially with all the restaurants nearby the rooms are super tiny don t be fooled by the wide angle lense used to take the picture very few tv channels this is more like a bed breakfast expect a bed in a good location and no other amenities location was about the only true benefit the staff was friendly no ventilation in the room and so eventually had to prop window with coat hanger teabags not replaced and no coffee available in room front desk staff men were pleasant but not very knowledgeable arrival had to wait for him to finish something and then check in was quick but called room number out twice so people in lobby could hear the woman at check out could have been a robot no eye contact no question as to the stay asked for room number did not confirm with name asked for payment and gave copy of bill no offer to put in an envelope did not enquire as to quality of stay wish good trip home or invite back any one would have been pleasant good central location offering an acceptable rate nice to have been asked for special requests and receive them i e bathrobe and slippers also some restaurant recommendations wifi servive was tiresome never been to a hotel where i had to get a new user name and password from front desk every day half of them didn t even work no positive hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid hopefully you take the feedback on board would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics right hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid hopefully you take the feedback on board would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics rightno negative excellent location near chatelet les halles station and very close to lovely bars and restaurants small rooms but comfortable beds and location makes up for it quick and satisfying breakfast the fact that we had to log onto the wifi every time we came back to the room was slightly irritating but only a minor issue really the location of this hotel was perfect for what we wanted right in central paris and convenient for taking the train to and from the airport the hotel was lovely smartly decorated and very clean and comfortable our room as are most rooms in paris a bit on the small side for four adults to be completely comfortable our teenage boys got a great deal of enjoyment out of the spiral stairway to our  th floor room the rest of of squeezed into the two person elevator a true luxury in this part of paris this hotel is pure paris traditional and welcoming it is located a short walk to two different paris m tropolitain stations that can whisk you away to any part of paris and the location of this hotel is near shopping and many bars restaurants without any transportation needed photos depict a much higher standard of hotel than reality good location but in quite a noisy area especially if on the front side of the hotel the smallest lift i have ever seen bath tiny and although there was a shower attachment you physically couldn t stand to shower due to the angle of the ceiling see photo location good really easy to find from gare du nord via the metro the room was minute you simply couldn t enter carrying your suitcase even a small one you had to go in sideways or else climb onto the bed to enter the room and a little soundproofing would be welcome as it s located very neat a number of noisy late night bars it was very clean centrally located and the staff were pleasant and efficient no access to hotel with car if driving pack light tiny lift fits   person   luggage bag bloody inconvenient when traveling with young kids and big luggage location toilet and bath room was not clean wifi was extremely slow and disconnected several times that is worth in upper floor the staff were so helpful and polite however there is a language barrier for some of the staff which just could speak french our room was called a junior suite but was basically a bedroom with a second single bed stuffed in a niche right next to the large bed fine for my mother daughter and i but lacking in privacy one might expect with a suite the public areas of the hotel seemed a bit worn while the location was central and convenient it lacked in charm though very close to the marias which is full of charm the room was charming just like the pictures and had a great balcony the location was very central and convenient to trains walking to the marais the louvre the location can also be busy so if you want a super quiet place don t stay here having said that the double glazing and sound proofing is excellent so after having a few drinks and enjoying the local surroundings you can go home in a few mins and not hear much at all shower was small and not the best water pressure not a huge deal for me but may be for some super comfy bed and nice room with good facilities the staff were extremely helpful and friendly nothing was a problem location is steps away from rue du rivoli forum des halles and so many other sights are in walking distance metro is a stones throw so central wifi connection problems due to room location as wifi works well in hotel in reception area spectacular breakfast and staff and very attentive to guest needs evreryone speaks english also a plus room bar fridge had a really bad smell which staff were quick to clean it still smelt after and cleaner was happy to do it a second time it still had a bad smell so i defrosted the fridge and cleaned it myself excellent location to restaurants and metro the decoration in the lobby is really not my cup of tea but that s personal and only a detail it has nothing to do with the rooms and the comfort great location near louvre lot of bars in the street x large bed for paris good shower and friendly staff i had a great roof top room with an excellent view of the quaint parisian rooftops surrounding but unfortunately the room only has a bath tub with no shower great location in paris walking distance from great destinations le marais notre dame and rue st honore would definitely return this hotel does not have the room sizes facilities or services you expect from a   star establishment even in paris at best this is an average   star hotel it is totally over priced as a result the corridors are narrow  cm and continuously crowded with hotel maids dirty laundry and cleaning equipment the room food service is sourced externally and therefore takes ages to be delivered the beds are hollow and the pillows too hard resulting in back and neck aches the wifi login is cumbersome and cuts off periodically at this price the breakfast which is served in a basement room should be free in paris it is cheaper anyway to go to a nearby street caf very good location within   meters of the chatelet metro station friendly and accommodating staff clean everything was good i could not wish for more location location location the hotel is nicely done with nice bathrooms and lovely furniture and there was   clean and neat everywhere this is not always standard in paris very expensive for the room size bathroom was very small and missing some showering items very small and slow elevator very nice hotel in very good location friendly staff clean and offer nice breakfast what wasn t so great was the photographs of the room had suggested the suite provided two separate bedrooms this was not the case additionally there were problems with the electricity where we had to turn on wall lights in order for sockets to work when one set of sockets worked others switched off the hotel location was great close to a metro station which allowed us to travel around paris with ease no negative it was my wife s birthday i asked for flowers and champagne as a surprise and they did as a surprise the hotel gave us an upgrade a suit so for us it was super no negative the breakfast buffet was so good i loved the assortment of cheeses and charcuterie i also loved the fresh orange juice machine small room with a small window i did not have breakfast because too   euro llocation very clever to come and go every where small bed for couple really nice hotel in city centre nice staff really helpful and if you need anything they will do it there were machine noises during the whole night i could not stand in the shower due to the roof really good service and breakfast central located no negative awesome comfortable room with good pillows and duvet good view over the pedestrian street below and very friendly and helpful staff room size for a four star hotel the room size was tiny the door only just opened past the bed hardly space for two people plus luggage the room was cosy especially the bathroom the location is superb close to sights restaurants and metro the room was cosy but clean and well serviced the cleaning wasn t great the location was next to the metro and many cafes but the room was quiet tight on space but had everything we needed my bed was a bit soft place was very clean and they have added a few amenities like how water pot and coffee very nice staffno negative the location is perfect very friendly staff and efficient small rooms but you wouldn t need more in paris very clean bathrooms and sheet our hotel room was a little small the bath had high sides and was difficult and dangerous to climb in and out for showering definitely a no go for anyone with mobility issues the separate wc was tiny and a squeeze to get into and close the door a wall telephone was place at hip height so often knocked on in error we didn t receive nightly turn down as expected and raised this with the hotel staff were helpful and friendly the location was excellent for getting around paris on foot or by taxi the lobby of hotel is crwodied with so many people and looks like market they should adjust the movement and the ambition of the hotel i booked one night and the management promised me for extend one more night but next day they change their mind for no reason else they should care a bit of room cleaning the location of the hotel from opera and shopping places and walking to everywhere is perfect no negative what a fantastic hotel having stayed in many hotels in paris this one was by far the best with fabulous staff and incredible location you will not be disappointed if you choice to stay here i was appalled by server who refused me to sit at the dinner one evening stating that i did not nook for donner despite that i told hom i was staying at the hotel it took other servers to give me a table clearly it was not an issue of space or lack of food it is somply that he did not want me to be served for someone who paid more than   euro this hotel needs to select its employees as this is a very bad signno positive free wifi is unacceptably slow and the paying high speed option is more a scam than a service in the year   in a   star hotel you re simply supposed to offer high speed wifi for free and calculate the costs in your overall rates a minor but tedious flaw in an otherwise perfect stay from arrival to leaving it was picture perfect staff was exceptional with a special mention for customer relations manager pauline most dog friendly hotel we ve stayed in the upgrade to our room was the cherry on the cake for a memorable stay at the heart of paris we will definitely come back the room we got at the beginning was a first floor corner room which is kind of out of our expectation because we were there for our honeymoon and i booked the room ahead however the staff were very helpful and we did upgrade to a very nice room with a little extra cost overall it s perfect nice location and facility the staff was very nice and helpful definitely will come back for our next trip in paris was quite upset to see trash can in bathroom was not emptied when we checked in location is great right across from opera garnier a few mins walk to galleries lafayette n rue de saint honore where all the boutiques are located beds were very comfortable n hermes toiletries were good the wifi connection was not very strong and it was hard to stay connected for longer than   or so minutes but it was free so i was able to post to the blog to let people know how i was doing and how my  th birthday was the staff made me feel at home in both their hotel and the city of paris i felt like family installation in room very noisy sounds like someone in the room above was vacuum cleaning all night it kept me awake the hallway and elevator is smelly next to my room was a service room where someone was smoking cigarettes in the morning the smell of cigarettes came into my bathroom location very friendly staff spacious room bathroom bed is great we ate in le lumiere and were very disappointed it was very casual and really just like eating in a bar the staff did not seem well trained at all the food was nice but very expensive for the type of place where it was served the glasses of champagne were very expensive and the wine list extortionate scribe staff in general at reception and the concierge and cleaners were excellent but the lumiere staff were sloppy and inefficient and did not reflect a   star hotel status the scribe hotel also made a lovely gesture for my husband s birthday with desserts and an upgrade to a beautiful suite which was superb the bed was wonderfully comfortable the hotel felt a bit outdated the checkin process takes longer than expected the hotel actually checks the credit card provided by charging   euro before accepting the booking they said that they usually returns back the euro once the client checks out that s bad at breakfast eggs was charged extra the bed and the location of the hotel was good the hotel is starting to look really run down i was really looking forward to staying a plush hotel the ceiling is peeling wall paper peeling the bathrooms are due for renovations the staff were extremely helpful polite and welcoming and location was perfect nothing to complaint about everything was just amazing breakfast was splendid i strongly recommend to everybody it is definitely worth the price location excellent walking distance to louvre and other monuments if you prefer you can take taxi wherever you want they are at the hotel door all days long services amazing staff was very friendly especially guest relationship manager laureen debrosse very professional customer friendly helpful charming she really helped to make our stay an unforgettable experience besides they help to to find good restaurants they book them and thanks to this we managed to eat in really very nice french restaurants if you look for a nice place in paris i advise yo to go to this hotel no real complaints the only thing if something negative can be said the storage space in the room was somehow limited the room was excellent with a very large and comfortable bed the bathroom was faultless too as everything in the hotel i saw a few features that could be refreshed but it is a busy hotel in a busy city so i am sure the maintenance has already be scheduled the location is perfect you can even walk there from gare du nord the lobby bar restaurant is good for business meetings i had a luxury room which was well proportioned by parisian standards no cons come to mind visited paris for the weekend with my   yr old daughter as she wanted to practice her french i chose the scribe for it s location and figured with the sofitel name beside it it would be acceptable we were not disappointed the location was great within walking distance to the things we wanted to do and see the reception upon check in was warm and welcoming and our room was upgraded without asking the room itself was modern spacious for paris comfortable and had a small balcony overlooking the street the staff was very polite and always helpful especially the concierge service team emmanuelle with whom i had spoken prior to our arrival with inquiries about possible language activities for my daughter was a complete delight she spoke in french with my daughter the whole time gave helpful suggestions of places to visit and even gave her a lovely parting gift a charming book in french we also had dinner at the hotel restaurant simply delicious as with the other staff members the restaurant staff was helpful polite and very attentive in all it was a lovely albeit short stay and i say merci beaucoup to the staff at the scribe we will definitely be returning toilet outside of the bathroom without a faucet and the small size was uncomfortable breakfast was expensive staff was very pleasant and helpful beds were extremely comfortable choice of a tub and a separate shower in the same bathroom was very convenient location is excellent it is a bit pricy for winter and the room will be tight for two people the bed was comfy and i liked the fact that when i came back to the room from an afternoon walk the room was tidied up again tiny spaces and corridors mediocre spa and health club the bell boy s and the men who stand by the entrance seem little rude their herm s range of toiletries are surely good the staff at the concierge and the reservation desk are very courteous and helpful the housekeeping was a bit sloppy as towels and coffee for the coffee machine the used cups and drinking water was not replaced in the night rooms were cosy and romantic i will definitely be back here next i am in paris my daughters were so spoiled by everybody i had to found good arguments to get them out of the hotel this hotel is the best one i did in paris i was travelling with my   daughters and they ve been welcome as princesses seeing their big smile on their face was priceless the hotel room was beautiful comfy and quiet even the breakfast was great with real fresh orange juice i travel a lot i did many hotels in paris but this one is so great i m sure to go back next time i go to paris no negative location left my phone at the breakfast table and went out on my last day halfway when i was out of the hotel i realised i had lost my phone i traced my steps back and the last place was the hotel i called the reception from the room asking if they had found a phone at lost and found but they said no i decided to try again at check out straight after my phone call from the room and the guy at the reception made a phone call to the breakfast room and told me they had found it that made my day thank you hotel scribe breakfast was worth it lots of selection they even had japanese breakfast the fitness center was limited the bathtub as in a number of hotels is high and can be challenging to get out of grab bars would help this hotel has a delightful ambiance from the moment one arrives the staff is catering to your needs the concierge staff was phenomenal the rooms are clean comfortable and well organized the location is ideal the shower instead of shower curtain i have seen the half covered by glass type of thing but you cannot shower will full blast without wetting the floor i do not understand why they have this kind of thing different culture in how to use shower location new and well decorated step into the shower is quite high and it would have been nice to be informed prior to arrival that the walk in shower was only available in certain rooms at   euros extra per night extra comfy beds and levels of service and great location staff could miss you in the little alcove upstairs in in tea lounge so you had to go back down to get their attention staff were welcoming and helpful and the ease of check in was great after a long flight is was nice to be welcomed by a smile and a no fuss attitude the food and wine selection offered was what you would expect of sofitel a very high standard thank you scribe for a wonderful stay we should have stayed longer the beds were ridiculously comfortable the double glazed windows french doors were brilliant and to be able to get fresh air into a room is always a great thing very bad welcoming there was a guy at the reception who was very rude they changed our rooms multiple times because of availability on our day of our departure the bellboy forgot one of our suitcases because the hotel was pretty busy we had to miss our train and lose   euro for coming back to get it location is the only good thing about the hotel as well as guest relations manager pauline basso bert who was really helpful after having trouble with the rest of the reception staff concierge staff were helpful tripe room was only a camp bed so a little cramped in room prob should have known excellent location concierge very helpful booking a fab dinner for us son poorly so allowed later check out in one of the rooms very accommodating bed a bit lumpy big dip in mattress hotel needed prompting to bring extra towels and amenities when the the room was for   people not   warm and responsive service when requests were made excellent breakfasts no negative great location near great shopping and walking distance from place de la concorde concierge staff was the best they were always very friendly and helpful room was relatively spacious and comfortable restaurants were good having to come home the location was excellent for the four days we were there close to many attractions the staff were very attentive to all our needs didn t want to leave very soft pillows when asked for firmer pillows staff brought more soft pillows have found same problem at sofitel wentworth in sydney one lift out of service out of three not enough to move guests quickly out of very small lobby area great nespresso machine in room was appreciated but not enough pods or milk housekeeping brought us more but i think it always looks a little penny pinching especially in a   star hotel when only just enough is provided for one cup of coffee comfortable room very pleasant polite staff room a little old fashioned shower screen inadequate irrespective of all the positives the nightly room charge is still formidable good location close to best shops and within walking distance of most key sites staff service very good room spacious by central paris standard and well equipped king size bed very convenient for roissybus service to from cdg i had an unpleasant incident in this hotel some money from my wallet have dissapeared when i left it in the hotel room the hotel s manager considered that is normal for hotel s guests to be stolen i had been left with a bitter taste after this hotel accommodation and of course with the manager s apologies i recommend to the future guests to take care of their personal things in this hotel no positive   hour wait to have my special room ready nothing special about it one of the beds was so old it was inclined all the time not clear where to have breakfast   separate places in   days location and friendly staff fully bilingual superior room is tiny if possible get an upgrade bed is a little too small as well room looks outdated wifi is to be renewed every day location personnel breakfast the initial room allocated did not meet our expectation the staff member involved was unable to resolve the issue but the customer service manager more than made up for the issue see below overall a very pleasant stay the room we were initially allocated did not match the room purchased however we were subsequently upgraded to a junior suite by a very helpful customers service manager laurine a late check out and a complimentary bottle of champagne were arranged to mark a significant wedding anniversary the room was very comfortable the staff very pleasant and the location excellent will definitely return no negative your staff reception xingxia was indeed very helpful to look into our request to change our room to a better view despite of your high occupancy rates as i highlighted that it is our honeymoon trip in paris maria too was very helpful to our many requests due to cop  it was sometimes difficult to find somewhere to sit in the lounge it was also a little annoying having to negotiate the press in the foyer amazing cocktails and staff hard to get a seat in the bar reception area because it was full with the ipcc conference people all staying in   star accommodation with large entourage and limousines climate change perfect place to stay in the heart of paris attentive helpful and friendly staff good spacious and comfortable rooms well everything ok just a bit expensive good location very good location the staff were very nice and helpful and we would be happy to come back again we booked for three adults room in addition to one doubl bed room however the extra bed was too small for   years old boy good location in paris with outstandig serviceno negative everything was just perfect the people in the reception bar concierge were super nice and very profesional for mrs aurianne the manager the prices are very expensive for coffee and breakfast over the top the bed was super comfy and the room large by paris standards nothing this was the first time my husband and i stayed at the hotel it was an excellent experience and we would definitely stay again the room was a bit on the small side and it was quite expensive the staff were very helpful the location excellent and the hotel very clean rooms to clean at   is a little late walk away n showers rather than baths bed was very good and staff very good the room was on the back side looking directly to another room window one meter away i asked for room change and was refused unless i paid moreno positive the facility that was not enaugh i like to all the staf from hotel that was very kind of us and quite room no negative the location the hotel itself and the staff great buffet breakfast in the bar area next to the reception wonderful concierge room service needs fine tuning towels brought in at     pm and litter cleared at the same time bed not made location fantastic can be very expensive drinks and food are especially expensive staff are amazing location is good rooms are a good size for paris room is so stingy staff s not polite except the taiwanese girl at reception she is helpful conversation with a male staff at reception on phone after checked in me hi can i

service me me i need two toothbrushes it s just basic request i know it s  pm but i just checked in staff yea but we are closed it s  pm me no positive no sweetener only sugar for hot drinks in my room hairdryer was hard to use as you had to constantly hold the button down for it to work bed really comfy room was perfect temperature great selection at breakfast a room with a bath would ve been nice but we didn t put in a specific request so that was something on us the staff were very friendly the room clean and the bar restaurant was lovely the underground parking was secure convenient and reasonably priced our room had a dodgy toilet flush and the evening menu in the hotel had nothing we liked but there were plenty of places to eat close by this hotel was perfectly situated for the olympia as we were going to comicon and hammersmith tube station was close by great staff buffet breakfast had loads of choice and was very nice ice machine is not working in the corridor staff refused to bring to our room we requested for   beds and was given a room with   bed coffee machine and safety box were broken housekeeping should have checked the amenities before letting traveler to enter the room size of the room for a   nights booking we got one single soap in the bathroom breakfast is too expensive in the morning starting at    am the house keeping crew starts knocking in the doors very laud waking uo all the guests around its so easy to improve in my dislikes lists that its even strange that its not fixed yet the location is very good a standard hotel for a fair price in london we were upgraded to a executive room which was very nice but the room was for   originally we booked a double bed a pull out bed so not much room in the bed we always stay at this hotel great location to visit our sonno negative lovely facilities very comfortable staff very attentive gave the impression nothing was too much trouble location also very convenient for the eventim apollo the reason for our trip dirty carpet and cobwebs on the ceiling the electricity cut out in the room for a bit we asked housekeeping to clean the cobwebs and nobody came the beds housekeeping cleaning the rooms bar staff were extremely slow food took over an hour to arrive with no apology bedding was not changed until     after calling housekeeping   times reception staff were friendly breakfast was good on arrival the male member of the reception team didn t seem to want to check us in and was only available to help after the female member of the reception team had welcomed us and call us over to check in hotel was clean the room size was good i appreciate that they manage to achieve the high price point hence it remains at sometimes eye watering levels but in a market where the offering doesn t vary from novotel location to location in fact this one doesn t even have parking it really does apply a very high premium the location is superb for anyone with business in paddington basin where a reliable brand is providing a consistent product which is supported by really polite and helpful staff staff in bar ignored me even though   of them were doing nothing food in buffet very oily room had seen better days not what i was expecting of a superior twin very close to the apollo poor signs for main reception near the main entrance maybe should be a notice on the ground floor near the other reception that is only for package holidays saying main reception to hotel is on the  st floor the room was a little shabby not as advertised on the website the reception area upstairs was nice when we eventually realised that s where we had to go after queuing downstairs near the main entrance for   minutes the bar area was nice we had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that i was male he proceeded to imply that i was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way this attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors to make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore i m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint the contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms the bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small the water ran hot and cold intermittently for some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa the aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope reception area restaurant and bar very contemporary the wifi was very good as was the breakfast the staff in the bar area were excellent especially the mixologist and waiter who were very friendly helpful and informative we stayed overnight to visit wimbledon and asked in the morning before we left for wimbledon if me may leave our car in the car park until we returned at night the very friendly girl at reception said yes no problem just come in at night to validate the ticket when we returned a very hapless young man took ages to validate the ticket moving from computer to computer and finally telling us we would be charged     we found this very steep and frankly were very surprised to be charged at all if we had parked in a parking garage off site we would have paid around   if the parking garage had been full we would gladly have paid extra for our parking but it was virtually deserted paying just under a   for the night for a basic twin room we would have thought parking would be included or at a very reduced rate the breakfast in the morning was excellent with very friendly efficient staff the two single beds were nice and roomy more like dubbles than singles the entrance is designed for coaches and while it is not far to walk to the tube station it is not a pedestrian friendly walk due to the entrance design being at the furthest away from the most direct path to the hammersmith tube and some construction poorly designed pathway and coach parking at the entrance level also the hotel is so large that you may need to walk a long distance to your room this was okay for me but if you have a lot of luggage or trouble walking long distances you might want to know this the room was a lot bigger for the price than hotels in paddington it was easy enough to go a few stops further on the tube to hammersmith i felt comfortable walking from the tube station which is in a handy shopping centre to the hotel   minute walk and it was easy to find also it is on the direct underground line for heathrow so really easy to get to and from the airport whilst the room was very comfortable and all the amenities that i required were there the poor condition of the carpet was quite apparent it was tired and worn out i liked most of the staff and their cheery manner once you broke through their training programmed attitudes as most of therm are from the continent it took them a little while to become accustomed to the australian humour they loosened up and they look better with a smile on their faces an observation not every customer would like that but having been in the customer relations business for   years of my working life a friendly smile goes a long way     for the staff there was one younger female of the front line staff who definitely could do with with a little training in relaxing and that all important smile instead of just doing the business staff could be more attentive and friendly overall the stay was nowhere near value for the amount paid toilet paper in bathrooms was poor room dining choice was poor expected more in provided room facilities considering the room price paid such as caffeinated coffee only decaffeinated provided a few more biscuits etc ultimately the room was not much better than a travelodge but at least double the price great location for my purposes nicely air conditioned good choice for breakfast nice size room a twin the cost of parking was ridiculous at   per day no information prior to going on this cost they say they don t run parking but it s under there hotel it would have been cheaper to take the train i only took our car as i may have needed to go somewhere further afield nice room size the rooms and hallways indicate that the hotel is not so new helpful staff i wanted to change a room and the receptionist did find one despite the hotel being quite booked he offered me a complimentary drink initially but i did not need it the gym is really great new well equipped the reception area is modern and gives a good vibe staff staff very serious on checkout staff kept checking i was a resident when we arrived back late from hyde park concert asked for food it was brought to us but it was like we had walked on off the street kept hovering and asking for room number didn t feel comfortable the breakfast whilst plentiful was cold breakfast was expensive for     great size room great location for us lovely public bar restaurant and modern feel to the whole building our room overlooked a building site the scrambled egg was under cooked had to pay full price for breakfast even if we only wanted cereal and toast would be nice to have a choice between a full cooked breakfast at the full price or a lighter breakfast at a lower price staff were very friendly and helpful our room was very comfortable the decor throughout was pleasant both breakfast and dinner were very good apart from the scrambled egg i booked a superior room i think this just means it has a sofa minimal bathroom toiletries minibar not stocked although it came in handy for keeping water and snacks cool no hotel information provided in the room it was just a bit underwhelming and it wasn t cheap comfortable bed air con was adequate on the hottest day since   perfectly located   minutes walk from the underground station air con broke and we had to ask twice for someone to look at it and never really got fixed standard of room was very average for executive whatever it was we asked for a room away from building works and they put us in a room right next to it no positive poor response from reception re cancelling breakfast they wouldn t allow it as booked through booking com i e mailed booking com who responded by advising me they had communicated my request directly with hotel to date i ve had no response as from hotel very very weak very little rooms outdated and noisy no air con only fan so room very hot and stuffy in summer and no sheets thick quilt only pillows were terrible flat expected more for the money close to the hammersmith tube station umm i have stayed a few times now over the last   months i stay there because it s close to my elderley fathers flat and i go to see him the superior rooms are a little tired bathrooms have mould on the fittings carpets tend to need a bit of a clean this time the door into the room looked like it had been kicked hard at the bottom and the lock was loose i did tell the reception staff when i checked out executive rooms tend to be nicer but are a lot more expensive i don t tend to eat there as the breakfast is so expensive it s in a good place very close to hammersmith tube station staff at reception cold when checking out no greetings or courtesy bathroom below average not worth the expensive rates large bed close to hammersmith station lady who checked us in was rather rude and unwelcoming not the best first impression to give breakfast was a bit hit and miss hard pancakes very runny scrambled egg and tea pots could do with a serious scrub also the tea and sugar supply in room was a bit stingy only   teabags and   sugars which is fine if you drink coffee too as there was plenty of that but sadly i only drink tea rooms were modern and we were selected for a free room upgrade was nice and quiet in our room no traffic or general hotel noise bar is lovely to sit in and food from there was yummy location is great if your staying to see a show at the hammersmith eventum one of the other reasons we choose this hotel was it stated in the details that the hotel had air conditioning it does not its rooms are air cooled we stayed on one of the hottest nights of the year and had an extremely uncomfortable night we complained in the night and the next morning when we were told the rooms are air cooled the hotel gave us two complimentary breakfasts and took our bar bill off the final bill as compensation for our unpleasant night thank you novotel it would be worth checking with the hotel and altering the incorrect details on your website lovely hotel perfect location for the appollo no negative really nice smart hotel everything was spotless the staff were lovely the room was perfect we got a free upgrade on arrival the restaurants they have were amazing will definately be returning no air conditioning in room fried eggs greasy only one toaster working and it took x  goes to brown the bread properly location to queens club friendly helpful staff good shower good selection breakfast the fact that was told the mini bar was free due to the upgrade but it was in fact completely empty housekeeping service extremely slow to take calls and to respond i also reported to main reception that someone had vomitted on the carpet in the corridor near my room an hour and a half later i had to report it was still there i walked past it   times to and from breakfast which was very off putting to the appetite and on departure rooms nice but had a guest of the day free upgrade so even better the smoking terrace was woefully neglected the morning after a friday night of drinkers and smokers i know that s not a higher priority as most people don t smoke but we do the fast efficient friendly service with a smile excellent food bar and overall atmosphere my wife normally doesn t like big hotels but she would come again happily the booking was messed up and the staff and managers could not have cared less at midnight they were still arguing about our needs to top it none of the staff in the breakfast room understand plain english want oats forget it they have no clue the food generally was poor but i asked for fresh fried eggs and got rubber eggs that reminded me of army food   years ago disgusting oh did i say the staff are shocking i hate the staff at the this hotel with a passion when we arrived i said to my wife i will be staying here in future when i visit london after staying there i will never go back did i say how bad the staff are shocking location the room i stayed in was very tired it needed a through deep clean and everything updated i have stayed in much better hotels for half the price there weren t any other rooms left in the hotel so i could be moved but i checked in at  am and just wanted to go to sleep as i needed to be out of the hotel by     also   for a cooked breakfast get in the real world very pleasant and friendly staff didn t think it was worth the money but it is in london it was close to the venue   minute walk and also the breakfast was lovely all staff was great and so polite too the shower dropped hot and cold during use but nothing major staff very friendly at reception there are also lots of facilities available if you wish to use them there was strange smell in room especially when the bathroom was open   out of   lifts were out of order all the time our key to room was blocked before the time we should leave the room this hotel needs total renovation no positive in the first room we were allocated there was a distinct smell of vomit near the bed we told reception and got moved in the next room only one plug socket worked and the air conditioning was broken which made the room like a sauna and meant neither of us could sleep we were headed to a wedding so hwd to dash else we would ve asked to be moved again beds were not to taste too hard when we got up we were bitten to death by a flea it wasn tthe best lovely welcoming staff great location windows that could open clean bathroom two hairdryers one in bathroom one under dressing table bedside tables a little too small to be practicable the location was perfect in a quiet street close to a busy transport hub on the line to heathrow and an easy tube ride to there or the city also everything so very spacious good restaurant loved the view towards the city from our ninth floor executive suite free upgrade see picture the bedroom had not been cleaned smelt and someone had laid on top of beds our room was changed so there were no twin bedded rooms one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed at     a m someone opened our bedroom door believing it was empty the tap pushing in the plug was broken and came away the bath was narrow the sheets and duvet cover was of poor quality the entrance and reception area the fact that our room was on the third floor and so far away from the lifts the carpet makes it hard to pull our trolley bags and the distance to the lifts which was on the other side of the building as mentioned was too far the windows looked out onto a roof i did ask for a nice view however i was told that the twin rooms were all on the third floor and that was the only view excellent breakfast and service from all of the staff not even bottled water in the room bit sparce although the kind receptionist did say next time to ask and she will make sure it s provided location the room was awful it looked like an nhs room it was awful and for the amount it cost i would expect a lot more i would also expect things like a shower hat in the bathroom the breakfast was good and the look of communal areas was of a good standard bathtub size too high for short people to step over no face washers supplied only one small soap for two people for shower and hand basin convenient location obliging staff good sized room excellent restaurant and coffee shop breakfast was awful and over priced they need a better chef and more choice in pastries etc the hotel is clean and fresh and of a good standard the breakfast left a lot to be desired and was really expensive bad smell room from elevator elevator very slow with long que waiting two days without make up for the room no one bottle water at leat served as complimentary or chargeable in addition staff was bot flexible to cancel one night ahead of time and insisting that booking should request so underground to center of london requires train changes space the only downside was in the bathroom this whilst showering the water as one would expect you placed at a setting comfortable for the user during showering the water temperature did alter from the original setting to being very hot to cold not what i was expecting however once you got used to this you could manage the changes in the water temperature location very good as tube station a very short walk away the underground car park was a plus point the price was acceptable as a guest this considering london car parking charges in general smell from sink of sewage air con wasnt very good outdated ipod dock that fits old style the coffee machine pump seems to be on its way out as very very slow very noisy people slamming doors all the time bedside plug did not work so to find my phone fully flat in the morning room was clean and bed was comfy great location good breakfast selection nice style room this remark is made in the certainty that finding a pleasant outlook from every room of a large hotel is far from easy that said i found the view from   interesting only because i was able to carry out a quite unscientific census of the numbers of a c units that had sprouted on london roofs since my last visit the surprise was that reception was on the  nd floor but the greeting i received was warm intelligent and most helpful i did eat in the hotel one evening but i found the food acceptable but more expensive than i had expected the bar was no less expensive although the staff were of high quality the bed the broken air con the fact that there was no extract in the bathroom it was hot and the air con didn t work the mattress was limp and saggy not great to be honest staff gave out a key to my room to a complete stranger who then moved in and hung his clothes next to mine in wardrobe and put his toiletries next to mine in the bathroom i returned to my room late evening to find all his bags and stuff intermingled with mine and i was horrified no one at reception answered my calls and i had to get a very kind man in room service to go to reception and make them call me had to move rooms in case weirdo came back horrendous experience hotel system failure comfy bed and great bathroom even though we cranked up the ac  c in our room and maintenance checked it twice the room was hot apparently their system was not ready for ac to be ran yet as it was not summer maintanance guy was crabby when he showed up their mini bar refrigerator did not chill drinks enough it only contained   bottles of water and they were barely colder than room temperature the grill restaurant was really really good and the staff was super attentive and friendly the hotel is less than a block away from the tube station there s a starbucks less than a block away and a grocery store by the tube ventilation in the rooom was very poor we had no sleep down to malfunctioning aircondition and one cannot open windows properly to ventilate staff was friendly and professional bathroom was in a poor state of repair unable to empty bath as plug device came off in my hand poor state of grouting in places leaving opportunities for dirt bugs to lurk no positive when i arrived i was informed that i had been upgraded to a premium room and so was looking forward to seeing my room the room decor is dated and certainly not luxurious could do with refurbishing the bedrooms or ones similar to the one i stayed in in keeping with the rest of the hotel the main areas of the hotel are modern and new breakfast was good and staff friendly the hotel is old and in need of a major renovation non of the electricity sockets were working the soap was not replaced the location close to olympia nothing to dislike i d happily stay here again i like the location for me getting to work at my client s office and for access to central london no negative loved the service the breakfast variety plenty of seating and spotless and the staff were always so very helpful and extremely pleasant everything you could have wanted was here at this hotel superb our room was over looking the flyover and close to the railway which operated all night the choices were as expected and served by attentive staff as the hotel was only minutes away from olympia breakfast was not rushed before a busy day no negative a great stay warm welcome at  pm this was my third stay the room was comfortable breakfast as usual was a sizeable spread and the service efficient the left luggage facility is a great boon will come back again next year silly thing only   teabags in the room that s it free upgrade including breakfast was great but would have been great value anyway restaurant staff very knowledgeable about food allergens which is rare as well tv could have been upgraded to a smart tv in this day and age friendly helpful staff got upgraded room as guest of the day and complimentary breakfast which we opted to have as room service with no extra charge would have preferred firmer bed but my husband found it very comfortable nespresso coffee machine nice little touch the water for tea and coffee was cold i asked   different members of staff for a hot cup of tea and coffee all that happened was they came and topped up the urn with a jug of hot water pouring on to the cold water in the urn the staff member then kept trying to light the small pot under the urn myself and my sister in law where taking our   year old mum for a follow up appointment after having heart surgery a month ago i requested a accessible room for mum as she can not walk far we were given one room with a double bed when we requested a twin room and the other room over looking the flyover we were then moved to a twin room which was as far as could be from the lift this was a real struggle for mum to walk to the lift the only helpful person was a young man in the restaurant who got us a wheelchair for mum as we did not want to make her move rooms again the checking in took for ages and the young girl who did this only gave us one room although i gave her the booking form sorry to say she also had a body odour problem some one took over from her after about  mins this was quite stressful as we had been travelling for   hours to get to the hotel very disappointing for a large chain hotel the selection was very good the staff very rude girl squeezing lemons at bar looked at me like a peace of dirt while being served at he bar the boss stopped the barman to tell him instructions of jobs needed doing and i was waiting to pay for my drinks milk in room was out of date curdled my tea disgusted at the charge of water in the room and the breakfast was over cooked food and they shut the second buffet early to prepare for lunch so everyone using one buffet so big ques and scraps of food left waiting to check out poor system people wer jumping ahead of us then staff on ipads serving people behind us took   mins for us to be served poor service poor hotel and i ve been to a few and never felt the need to write a bad review i liked the lifts parking is very expensive even when you are a resident in the hotel lifts were a little slow staff were very attentive felt really looked after as we were chosen as guest of the day free room upgrade and drinks room was clean and spacious nothing had a lovely time spent at the hotel got to check in early and when i went to check we were told that we had been selected as guest of the day and got a free upgrade on the room and breakfast in the morning really made the stay a pleasureno negative a nice modern hotel great location for olympia restaurants were excellent rooms clean modern and comfortable car park a real bonus particularly as it was underground and very secure car parking charges were unexceptable we stayed there for   days and were charged     per hour which totalled   i think a day rate should be set up for hotel guests not an hourly one the service and atmosphere was lovely temperature in the room to stuffy bed ok only   pillow each television sound didn t work properly bathroom old fashioned not a good selection of toiletries no shower cap room not cleaned first night so no tea coffee milk not a lot eating in the hotel was expensive we didn t have breakfast there for that reason and the buffet we had one evening was ok but pricey for what we got we would have preferred to eat in the bar that evening but the bar area is very small for a hotel of its size and we couldn t get seats we loved the hotel the room was great and the view from it on the  th floor was fabulous the staff were all were helpful and everywhere looked lovely about a   min walk to the tube station which is serviced by   lines as well as the bus station the amazing westfield shopping centre is   stops away on the tube staff doesn t respond quickly the room lacked cleanliness water system not working properly tap water smelled like sewage we requested changing the room but no response the shower was bad also too expensive for what they offer location bed rooms are in need of some tlc very efficient check in and check out by friendly helpful staff hotel has excellent location especially for hammersmith appollo very dissapointed with our room although location was good as had some skyline views we were next door to the ice machine and until early hours of the morning we could hear people talking whilst using the machine our room temp was uncomfortably hot the shower in our room was varying from cold to scolding hot making our morning shower far from pleasurable i had to leave washing my hair not at all pleasant i did report this to the reception but little was offered in compensation i feel for the price of our one night stay the whole visit was displeasing and not worthy of a higher rating than a premier inn although only got to enjoy one cup at breakfast as staff particularly busy i my request for more was forgotten coffee in the room was also enjoyable the view from the room wasn t perfect but it s hard to see how that can be improved also we were only there for   night so it didn t really matter the location was excellent staff very friendly and i love that they do their bit for the environment by not bleaching the sheets great choice at breakfast the extortionate parking cost at weekend given that there is no charge for on street parking at weekend across from hotel the appalling amount of litter directly outside entrance to reception room was very comfortable rooms are not air conditioned it is a cooling system that did not work day   complained and they said a technician would have a look  hrs later on return to room had to complain again before technician came who clearly knew it wasn t working said he would have a look at it the next day and brought a fan fan didn t help it was so warm in room complained again and they moved us room it was cooler day   returned to room early evening after a busy weekend only to hear extremely loud music complained    pm to be told it was a wedding in function room and they couldn t do anything about it it would end  pm but we could move room advised i had already moved room but if finished at  pm i would put up with it     complained again music even louder was told they would go have a word with organiser     complained again was told i would get a call back     a different member of staff called back saying the event was on until  am i like music but i don t pay to stay in a hotel room and go to bed to listen to two and a half hours of loud banging music on leaving in the morning staff were very good at apologising but that s just not good enough no positive returned from sting concert to bar toilets female x  one without loo paper and other its handle wouldn t flush at approximately     hours on       the staff were woefully slow waited   minutes to be served   behind bar and   patrons waiting to be served and no bottled water behind bar to take to room breakfast was very good variety great service at breakfast very good thoroughly enjoyed breakfast the room was superior and the hotel is   star i was expecting a better quality more spacious more commodities and newer in comparison with the reception entrance area and outside the restaurants of the hotel are very good one more expensive and the other with reasonable prices and quality the location is also good especially to catch the tube carpets throughout the hotel had a funny smell and seemed to be in need of a very deep clean or replacement better vegetarian options would be good staff were terrific maybe to be offered a top sheet as well as a duvet lovely hotel staff very welcoming we had a room upgrade as we were customers of the day nice surprise we were visiting family in hammersmith so location good second stay here and if i d have had this same experience the last time i stayed i honestly would have stayed in a premier inn and paid far less room was dated in need of a major revamp the room was filthy with tea stains up the wall the bed was rock solid and uncomfortable and the pillows were awful worst nights sleep ever i requested to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was packed and given that last time the room was lovely and i had no trouble i suspect they were at maximum capacity and using rooms they wouldn t normally all in all i wouldn t recommend this place and never intend to stay again no positive the only downside to our stay was the price of parking at the hotel considering we were guests of the hotel and paid a significant amount to stay the one night i would of thought we would of had a better rate on the parking our car was parked in the underground car park for under   hours and cost us   i just thought this was very expensive and if i had previously known the price i would of considered parking elsewhere the breakfast was lovely and staff were really friendly and helpful with directions parking charges we had two rooms and when we checked in we set off to our rooms to find one occupied and one unmade after return to reception and room swap we had an uncomfortable night down to poor aircon a complimentary breakfast was provided with an apology but this doesn t make up for our experience the hotel above l  needs a good refurb in my opinion the day we had before we checked in the bathroom was disappointing for a   star hotel shower didn t drain well possibly not as hot as it could have been looked a bit tired the tea and coffee in the room could have been better the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet hotel is very crowded so expect delays to be serviced for any activity check in out breakfast lift hotels in london use to be very expensive this one exceeds many of them staff is very efficient the really noisy building works which started over the road at  am in the morning and are going to be there for a long time i mentioned it as i checked out when they asked if everything was ok oh yes the receptionist said we know all about that shame they hadn t bothered to tell me before i booked in the bed was big and comfortable no minibar lights in room couldn t be dimmed either on or off the nespresso machine and free coffee pods in the room were great shower was amazing buffet dinner was excellent great views of london eye and shard from top floors when i booked online i requested a room with a view when i arrived i was offer a upgrade with breakfast inclueded my upgrade was over looking a building site great view wanted a lay in after a concert but  am was woken by the noise so i shower with only   complementary shower gel to share between   went down for breakfast to be told i hadn t been upgraded and breakfast wasn t include wanted     for a breakfast disgraceful as with the cost of room smaller then expect for a superior double and with food and drinks at the bar i spent   reception wasn t helpful and i wont be returning anytime soon bar staff were great but then they was taking my money our room was not cleaned once during our stay also kettle was faulty and ended up blowing a fuse so the tv and fridge stopped working the scrambled egg at breakfast was fantastic floor so slippery in the shower i took a nasty fall had to ring down fo bathrobes brekfast while adequate too much walking around with plates drinks nd toast etc fried eggs as hard as charity cleanliness it stuff room was very small mini fridge in room but can t be used even for your own goods without paying tv volume limited to very low rooms look re done so lots of weird stuff like latches on doors that can t actually be used walls seem very thin in that you can hear a lot of neighbouring noise location staff optional facilities i didn t use any of these check in and out was easy we could clearly hear every conversation from the adjoining rooms both days we woke up because of our neighbors discussions amazing breakfast comfortable bed the room was clean and well equipped price food couldnt find correct light switch toiletries provided minimal despite having an exp room the room waa standard bht i thought the price per night was high room would need sound proofing top to bottom we could hear guests in the next room using the toilet kids running round in room above ours from    am in morning until    pm at night kids also running up and down corridor and in and out of their rooms which every time loud bangs from door closing i understand families with young kids who probably really excited too and have every right as others when in hotels my kids weren t always teenagers but respect and consideration for others is something i was taught as a youngster and passed onto my kids too i had been looking forward to a break away from home just my teenage daughter and i on this break to see a gig the apollo a bit of normality after my daughter has been seriously ill for some time but to be honest we came home more tired than when we arrived i did bring to managements attention and the best that was offered was another room but was a room with an access door to another room where other guests would be to me that wouldn t have solved a problem we weren t given any details of facilities available to us either a few minor problems when we checking in as my dad was paying for us and no physical card with us after an hour or so management did sort everything but no info of times or where go if we wanted to get breakfast just left to get on with it we ordered a continental breakfast to the room     per person which honestly that bad didn t order again next day while checking out we got told by staff about the buffet style breakfast we should have opted for in the restaurant same price info not shared by anyone house keeping need to double check their cleaning methods our table still had wet ring from cup i was drinking and biscuit crumbs from that morning still there when returned early evening the container cleaning powder was left in the bathroom though where it was used i couldn t tell staff were pleasant room warm power shower excellent plenty hot water though if i was larger hips i couldn t have a bath as very narrow location brilliant for eventim hammersmith apollo gig basically just round corner transport bus train close by no negative staff were friendly welcoming and attentive for a large hotel the service felt very personal good breakfast and general facilities including fitness suite room and bathroom were very clean close to public transport links hair in the bathroom which again confirm me the uk standards   hotel are way below v other countries this hotel in italy for example would be considered a low   hotel also the hotel way out is at a lower ground floor leading to a parking in a dodgy area not very cool for a novotel location staff bar main reception only got one pillow bit uncomfortable the key didn t work one of the nights so had to go get it redone easy check in friendly staff the room was spacious and well presented difficult to get taxi when going out in the evening reception called and was informed it would be     minutes we walked up to the high street and hailed a taxi friendly and attentive staff well to be honest it was all very good but spa and sauna facilities would be amazing great room great bathroom fantastic breakfast staff friendly attentive but also totally professional especially happy to discover my window could open did someone read my previous review the bathroom looked lovely but the shower was very weak great location for a concert at the hammersmith apollo and easily accessible for the underground the fact that there wasn t a designated smoking area closer to the room and i had to go all the way outside from my room which was a long way and i got woken up at  am when check out was at midday the fridge in the room i think their could be more options on the room service menu not a very wide range in food or drinks the staff were really friendly and the breakfast in the morning was the best i ve ever had no negative very comfortable bed offered an upgrade without asking with lovely coffee machine very friendly helpful staff clean and felt safe travelling alone one lift out of order so had to wait a little longer for other one but not a major problem clean fresh room nice friendly housekeeping staff came to set up sofa bed reception staff very helpful and cheerful enjoyed our stay bar service for drinks was slow there was a conference and one feels that better planning by the hotel would ensure adequate number of bar staff working good location to the tube good restaurant breakfast and bar meals good gym facilities checking in and out was easy trying to get a lift you were waiting for ages we took the stairs a lot but was only on the  rd floor i imagine any higher this could be an issue amazing location staff were friendly room was lovely and breakfast is amazing just booked again no negative upon arrival to the hotel we were informed that we had been selected as guests of the day which comes with a free room upgrade and complementary drink vouchers the carpet and sofa was a little tied looking so definitely take slippers the room was a good size and a comfy bed with an excellent view over london and the wembley arch in the distance from my  th floor window rooms are tired need upgrading extractor fan in bathroom didn t work neither did the hairdryer and speaker awful smell in room probably from filters in central heating aircon they need to up their game on maintenance good location staff friendly and efficient breakfast was additional to our booking we thought it expensive and found somewhere more reasonable we had to ask for our complimentary coffee and tea in the room to be replenished the kettle still had water in it from previous occupants great location nice size clean comfortable rooms very quiet during the night so we were able to sleep helpful and pleasant staff made us feel very welcome i expected more for the money the executive room was pretty basic one bathrobe and slippers between two of us difficult to communicate with some of the staff as their english was so poor bar area not big enough for the capacity very clean and the breakfast was amazing the only thing we had a problem with was there not being enough milk in our room for drinks and the restaurant was a bit too expensive for out tastes the value they have for their customers every member of staff went out of their way to make sure our start was perfect it was a little further away from the olympia than i thought but was a nice walk lifts were a bit slow at times great bed huge and very comfortable the food was excellent especially the breakfast burgers in the bar area were amazing too staff very friendly and helpful the room was shabby and drab the carpet was stained and grubby and the furnishings were not comfortable also there was only one socket in the room to use for any electrical items i expected a much higher standard from the novotel brand the staff and food were great and the public areas like reception fitness centre and bars were lovely had a long wait for the porter to collect baggage out of the luggage room then he couldn t find out case room was lovely staff pleasant and efficientno negative the beds and pillows were really comfortable lovely the short walk to dinner which the receptionist booked for us on arrival great location to the venue no faults at all room clean and beds made every day a fantastic breakfast lots of options hot and cold loved the scrambled eggs all staff are very friendly and polite will stay again no negative we stayed at the novotel because we was attending an event at olympia this hotel is in the perfect place easy to get to from the train and a   minute walk to olympia there is a huge selection of places to eat on the high street if you choose not to eat in the hotel we had breakfast included with our stay which was lovel and the beds are so comfy would highly reccomend this hotel i stayed two weeks in the hotel lifts were a horror only few of them working always crowded and you never know whether they take you up or down i was taking stairs instead living on the fourth floor but i can t imagine those staying on the ninth floor to do it a hotel is a bit worn out some refreshment of furniture and renovation would be welcomed horrible toilettes that were splashing out water even with the closed cover i had problems with getting hot water few times there was only cold water running down the shower the service was really good nice and helpful staff i could even weight my luggage before leaving the hotel and re arrange it the hotel is clean good location for my professional needs many restaurants pubs and shops around good connection with the center gym a bit small but with the necessary equipment when i used it it was not crowded so just what you need breakfast is overpriced better to use nearby facilities at the underground station if on a budget could give a better free biscuit with the tea and coffee only  ish mins walk from olympia and hammersmith station room was large clean and surprisingly quiet luggage storage very useful good value for money in central london given the room size and location no negative taxi service was bad they did not have a free shuttle to the airport like most major hotels in major cities they had their own private taxis that you had to pay extra for every time i see this i think there is an under the table bribe somewhere i had to walk about   meters to get a real local taxi the rooms being so small the dark alley that you have to walk down at night to enter the hotel a little pricey to not have breakfast included and small cold rooms i ate at the bar restaurant food was overly priced and horrible skip the fish chips all together the staff was very friendly and helpful and always eager to assist the rooms were small and cold only thing they had were sheets and no comforters to keep us warm throughout the night the heat barely worked and the rooms are really small for the price i chose to rent an apartment for our last night in london just so we could spread out and have some room would have liked poached eggs no mirror in the bedroom to sit at the desk dressing table to dry your hair the option of crispy bacon was good upgraded to a superior room and given a free drinks voucher a welcome surprise shower wasn t fab just the type of shower not powerful enough the lifts stopped on every floor in the morning when i went down for breakfast and returned and on most floors there was no one waiting for lift bed was very comfy rooms clean with coffee tea making facilities and ironing board iron chairs in the room could be a bit more comfortable entry on ground floor no sky sports no shower mat in room no biscuits in room nice and quite room was spacious with iron and ironing board bose bluetooth speaker very comfortable bed a proper bed there was absolutely nothing i didn t dislike about this hotel friendly and helpful staff modern and clean hotel and a great breakfast would recommend this hotel and most definitely stay again nothing all really nice we were the guests of the day which was a lovely surprise and got breakfast included as well as a room on  th floor the bed was very comfy fantastic hotel in every way no bath bathrobes or slippers in the room as was stated on my booking this had to be requested told housekeeping closed then one bath robe brought to room at midnight not even two or any slippers only explanation given was that we were upgraded however did not meet the basic standard facilities as posted on the booking page disappointed facilities were not all in there for such a big price of   for one night no positive it was full both nights we were there and so everywhere was crowded checkin took a while the restaurants wre heaving had to go early to beakfast otherwise wouldn t have got a table quickly we just really didn t like how crowded and busy it felt location parking choice at breakfast quick checkout late night early morning noise from other guests room adequate but a little bit tired short notice stay convenient for businesses in hammersmith no negative exceptional reception staff at ground and second floor they satisfied every special request i made the room was sparkle clean and fully equipped very good breakfast and the bartenders were very friendly and charming located at   minute from hammersmith tube station the perfect stay shower head couldn t adjust very slow wifi and electricity when charging lack of wall sockets near bedside very cleanly hairdryer and iron included in the room great location near the hammersmith apollo and hammersmith tube station fairly basic and room was very hot air conditioning was broken so temperature couldn t be adjusted clean relatively comfortable and good value for money no negative the bed was extremely comfy staff were also very friendly had a slight problem as we first got to the room and this was fixed within   minutes of me reporting to reception terrible sleepless night due to other guests partying woken up at  am still people walking halls talking loudly at    am you need security walking the halls saturday nights no positive smoke alarm in room went off at    pm for  sec just enough wake in blind panic but no actual alarm man next door coughing non stop in the morning it was from about  am both days started to feel sorry for him we didn t book breakfast but was told at check in we were guest of the day upgraded to executive room and free breakfast result rooms on  th floor are good with decently coffee machine with pods hotel easy walk to olympia where we had a exhibition also easy walk to shepard bush staff were helpful but as english wasn t their first language this was a bit of a problem the hotel looks tired and needs a refit the layout is strange reception on the first floor not ground floor rooms are small and feel like a budget hotel we wouldn t stay there again the event i attended at the novotel was excellently organised however i think this was more down to the actual event organisers rather then the novotel staff only one thing to mention please check your electric watter kettles in rooms when watter is boiled and you fill up te cup each time boiled water leaks on to the surface they probably should be changed to new ones thanks great breakfast comfortable room great location no negative i stay every year sometimes twice a year when i exhibit at olympia it is really convenient was very impressed that i got an upgrade to breakfast on this occassion it was a nice touch i don t eat enough breakfast to warrant paying over   but being offered a free breakfast meant i could enjoy some fresh fruit and tea before heading off no negative definitely geared up for business travellers and i would consider staying here for business in the future this trip was for pleasure the staff were very friendly and helpful we had booked a standard room but on arrival were advised that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a great surprise the review is therefore based on this but if we were to go back again we d be more than tempted to go for the upgrade anyway location was perfect for visiting nearby family central london and theatre land is a decent tube journey away but completely do able from here and allowed for a relaxed stay without being in the middle of the madness the whole time my only issues were breakfast was a set price of     regardless of how much you had as someone who eats very little in the morning this was not good value also the bar stopped serving food around  pm despite it being advertised as up to  pmno positiveno negative this hotel was fabulous we were their guests of the day when we checked in and so we got upgraded to an executive suite and free breakfast each morning of our stay room was fab and breakfast was so nice located a few mins walk from hammersmith station so this was great for getting around no negative loved it here the convention i was attending was at the same hotel and upon arrival i was made up to hear that i d been picked as guest of the day upgrading my room with free breakfast very welcoming and lovely hotel had a great weekend th room was fairly basic for what was billed as a   star hotel the bathroom certainly didnt meet   star standards hammersmith is practically the end of the line so there was an awful lot of travelling on the tube but it was easy enough parking shgould be free even with the discount it was far too expensive if we had time the bar restaurant facilities and the gym all looked very good superb hotel fantastic staff really enjoyed our upgrade and the complimentary drink fantastic view lovely room will definitely return thank you so much novotelno positive shabby decor rooms are painted white on what looks like   s woodchip wallpaper the tacky plastic flowers planted at the main entrance should of been our  st clue poor quality of bedding with wafer thin pillows possibly the cheapest toilet paper i ve ever experienced in a hotel of this price range very noisy even for london we were woken at    am on a sunday morning by staff wheeling trolleys full of what sounded like glassware we were on the  th floor followed soon after by regular chambermaid trolleys rolling up and down the corridor with clunky wheels the sound between rooms is also easily audible staff look bored and the bar staff give you the feeling that they re waiting for a better job to come along to whisk them away when i did comment about the issues i had at the front desk it was met with an oh well shrug of the shoulders and hasty preparation of my bill i ve had better stays in premier inns and for   a night i would seriously look elsewhere local to what we needed nothing it was all great staff always fantastic and helpful wonderful receptionists we had a problem with roadworks noise and reception did everything they could to make us happy immediately offered room switch it was late in evening and we were too tired to pack everything up the hotel gave us complimentary breakfast next morning very attentive and friendly staff modern beautifully decorated great lighting macs and printers available in reception area handy for printing out flight tickets etc we love staying at this hotel and it s always our go to tube is   minute walk to hammersmith and buses into the city centre are opposite hotel plenty of restaurants shops just   mins away the carpets was clean but think it could do with a change as lots of marks stains staff were amazing very helpful and always smiling excellent customer service bed was comfy room was huge and very clean internet was a bit hard to log on to issues with shower the water pressure was too low and sinks were clogged place was clean and the staff was friendly only one small issue with sockets not working in room but was very quickly resolved by staff popping up to our room with a replacement key for an alternative room great service breakfast was great and hotel was way nicer than photographs depicted especially public areas very pleasantly surprised slightly confusing entrance system on   levels comfortable hotel very good breakfast buffet style with plenty of choice good views from our room with a small but well equipped gym friendly and helpful staff not at all sound proof so didn t sleep well rarely saw any staff lovely bathroom great bath nice room layout good room a luxury for london proximity to travel options space in hotel great bed as we are all big tea drinkers would have liked more tea bags i came to meet up with my two sisters we had a great time finding the rooms very comfortable even just to sit around to chat in we ate in the hotel food was good service great it was all we expected it to be great couple of days the surcharge for the mini fridge for a  ml bottle of water of     is very excessive how about two free bottles of water the room and bathroom were impeccable clean and the free wi fi was stable the only minor thing i would say which isn t really a criticism just a side note the breakfast food wasn t labelled so it was tricky to determine of the sausages were non vegetarian or not and you couldn t be sure of the flavour of the pastries but it all tasted lovely anyway the breakfast was great so much to choose from and plenty to have to fill you up the room was perfect size and very clean no noise disturbance from other guest or the outside world the location for the hammersmith apollo was excellent a   minute walk at most construction just outside window vibrated entire room stating at     each morning bed wasn t great as far as comfort breakfast was good desk staff super friendly bed was too close to the wall so knocked knees feet on the wall when getting up during the night helpfulness of reception staff lovely bar food before we went to a concert at the apollo easy check out booked a double room was given a twin and had to complain so called superior room very basic and hence overpriced for what it is staff great restaurants good no positive construction work outside hotel was very noisy but i guess this only temporary ac not working in room so very cold night but staff very helpful and moved us to another room couldn t fault the price for the quality and location of this hotel there was a very long queue at reception to check in although the staff remained cheerful and did the best they could with the resources they had loo roll was in short supply the room was clean and comfortable facilities in the room were very good two hairdryers i appreciate most of the reception staff are international but sometimes my ol ears just cant understand them but they are very polite perfectly attired and smile genuinely so thank you we decided to have an evening meal in the aroma restaurant a set price buffet including three course we tried it and it was superb we will definately eat there again plus it was my wifes birthday and they upgraded our room to an executive wow very much appreciated we were charged for twice as many rooms as we booked and are now left chasing around for documentation to prove that this occurred   minutes on the phone only to be told that i have to prove that i have overpaid the hotel took no notice of my booking confirmation from booking com who made the error certainly not me but i am going to have to wait for an age to get my money back we were upgraded and received a free breakfast everything was perfect even if our neighbours were a bit noisy a really fancy and confortable hotel we had a really great time the staff is very kind and helpful the finish in the bedroom walls looked cheap the bathroom looked old and when we ran the bath water the water was dirty that came out location was good there is a large and active construction site across from the hotel rendering the noise level occasionally higher than the standard urban level and as is sometimes the case in large capital city hotels there was a large group of still tipsy loud and poorly supervised young adults teens dominating the lobby the day i arrived still that was par for the course the staff was supremely professional and courteous they offered to let me check in a bit early once the room was ready clarified and resolved a minor clerical error in the booking and made sure all was set for my partner who was arriving after me to pick up a key to the room the breakfast cost extra but was well worth it plenty of options for carnivores and vegetarians alike the hotel is conveniently located between heathrow and central london and has excellent public transport connections there are a number of pubs restaurants cafes and shops tesco boots etc nearby i would definitely stay here again minor issue in room   the overhead showerhead needs descaling london s hard water has caused some of the spouts to be blocked it s not unusual january   selected as guest of the day and provided with a complimentary room service upgrade novotel hammersmith london uk continues to provide a superbly attentive service friendly beautiful staff a credit to the novotel brand within a contemporary environment on the outskirts of central london so it s in a quieter location and provides value for money the premium room is superbly decorated with a large double bed that is like sleeping on a nimbus cloud for seven hours the provision of high quality absorbent towels in the walk in shower were a delight to use after stepping out of the rain storm like overhead shower the free to access wi fi is consistent throughout the building rooms the bose sound bluetooth sound system was a pleasant surprise overall excellent even if you are not upgraded all the rooms are very good quality and the serve yourself eat as much as you like breakfast is truly remarkable value for money i hate to recommend novotel hammersmith to you as it may mean it would be difficult for me to reserve a room in the future but i will wholeheartedly room furnishing is more like a   star hotel location near olympia good for conferences and exhibitions attendees clean nice lounge bar rich breakfastno negative i was greeted with excellent customer service and i was guest of the day meaning my room was upgraded the bed was very comfy and the shower was very powerful breakfast was lovely but the did have to queue to be seated as it was very busy staff were very accommodating first impression of entrance area doesn t do hotel any favours felt like a basement shame because it is a lovely bright place once you suss it out lift to reception all a bit confusing whole of that floor could be better laid out lovely twin room with larger single beds spotless and comfortable would have liked extra pillow nice bar all staff delightful for the   for   nights a breakfast included would have given far more value to the deal as a friend of mine was staying in a hotel in russel square slightly cheaper but breakfast was included in price for me that was a big let down i do not think i would book with novotel because of that clause the attention of staff at reception was great having staff like that at the front of house is a bonus for any business very helpful and welcoming any questions or requests were attended to which is value to all customers again a bonus to the hotel great staff don t forget to give them the applause for the good job the do no negative the receptionist found out is was my son s birthday and bought up a family sized desert just for him to celebrate and also gave us a room upgrade the rooms are not well cleaned initially we have given a room which had annoying construction noise but when complained we have given a room on the other side with no noise the room was very hot due to the heating system been controlled by the hotel water was only supplied on the first and last day of the stay thought as i understand should be on everyday bed sheet was changed based on request in a nice area close to the bus and tube station and many shops and coffee shops in the area close to central london the hotel is very big with nice lobby and nice atmosphere the service from the kitchen   minute wait for a minute steak in ciabatti really little things on customer relations really like getting the attention of the staff in bar for table service more interested in bar service than serving tables also after meal they don t ask if you would like anything else or a coffee you could be making more money and leaving the customer feeling like they have been attended to rather than serviced the breakfast buffet was almost plastic in its appearance a little chopped parsley on top of the scrambled eggs would be nice and well the poached eggs looked like a frizbee and tasted pretty much the same staff setting up and cleaning tables next to you in the rush to get ready for lunch takes away from a leisurely breakfast experience the bed was very comfy good wifi reception polite staff the bed was very very soft being  ft  inc a lot more support was needed didn t get a great nights sleep hotel and facilities were great very close to the venue i was working at that night only there one night and didn t fine anything objectionable while staying there everything in the room was comfortable and clean and the bar area was nice and relaxed after returning from the concert that evening staff friendly and polite during stay sorry there is only so much you can do in one night the room was quite cold and the heater didn t seem to make much difference even when on full they made me a dairy free omelette to order i also had the bacon that was beautifully crispy a rare option in many hotels the reception on the first not the ground floor very pricey but that s london i guess i paid literally half the rate for a similar hotel the next night in glasgow convenience of location for hammersmith shops tube into central london only the too soft bed great location we d taken a   hour flight into lhr and arrived at  am the staff were excellent allowed us to check in early and upgraded our room the bed was too soft for me but that s personal choice the breakfast was outstanding felt breakfast was a bit unorganised but enjoyable all the same beds comfy lots of lovely hot water tea and coffee in room very good always time for a cuppa was advised parking was   per night but is actually     an hour this is the resident rate which you only get if you validate at reception although no one told us that and we had to go back or pay   breakfast was poor quality and chaos very clean comfortable and modern we liked everything nothing bad to say i liked that we were chosen as guest of the day and was upgraded to the executive suite the room was immaculately clean tidy and very nice interior the staff were very friendly and very helpful i would have preferred softer and thinner pillows rooms were clean and comfortable great shower facility breakfast was great and had everything we wanted staff were very friendly and helpful restaurant food lack of local knowledge at reception poor english of several at reception noise in corridor most especially expensive parking quiet outside from courtyard nothing this is our  th stay at this hotel which should tell you how much we enjoy staying here the room we had had just been upgraded so was lovely and clean as always i know the carpark is     an hour but it is london are already planning our next trip to this hotel building works left the hall to our room dirty decor to room could do with a refresh bed hard only   pillow water splashed out of bowl when flushed only two teabags location we d asked for milk for the room which didn t come but this was a very minor problem we were upgraded to a premium executive room as their guest of the day and we had a free full breakfast each to go with it couldn t fault the hotel at all nothing everything absolutely perfect will use again whenever i need hotel accommodation super service from a very reputable company nothing i would have expected less from taxi cabs are not available at the hotel had to go onto the high st and down to hammersmith pain on a wet day breakfast is far too expensive at  stg gr requested extra pillows and got them a female front desk person was very attentive thin with dark hair poorly signposted from road reception staff could barely speak comprehensible english on arrival the receptionist chose to check us in on the guest side of the desk and faced away from us throughout so it was almost impossible to understand a word he was saying supply of tea bags milk in room were stingy rooms were characterless bed was comfortable and room was clean and had everything required tea coffee making facilities available room was needing a bit of tlc some fixture and fittings a bit loose tatty but ok comfy bed good hot shower good wifi excellent location for olympia and the hammersmith area happy to walk about this area on my own i had two stays in novotel west london in the past   weeks     days in general my staying was very disappointing the main problem was the noise from the construction site next door starting at  am finishing at  pm monday to saturday it was really annoying to get awaken by construction machines every day other nuisances there were not enough power outlets only in one side of the bed and no usb ones one of the rooms i stayed had only   tv channels other one had   you need to re log into the wifi network every day which was annoying and unnecessary toiletries were not consistently provided we went days and days with no bar soap or moisturiser room temperature was not pleasant we had to open the windows to have some cool air into the room breakfast for   pounds was crazy last year i stayed at hilton kensington and i think it was much better value everything was clean this hotel is located right next to my company s building so that was very convenient for me long walk to room exits slightly confusing beautiful christmas decorations very polite and helpful staff great food in lobby bar and fantastic breakfast perfect location for olympia room had everything including hot shower checkin agent confirmed a double bed when we found a twin in the room slow elevators overpriced bad room design light switches shower close to the underground good restaurant fast wifi very loud music going on til after midnight that stopped me sleeping even when i was on the third floor rooms clean but very basic only one pillow and   of the sockets in the room didn t work breakfast was lovely shower very basic and the water temperature could have been hotter very comfortable bed good food good location for our needs staff very attentive and helpful good facilities nice getaway had to wait around for porter to leave baggage with cleaning staff knocked once before entering room to see if we needed more water could have knocked a few more times we were upgraded and given free breakfast only the elec lights worked in my room kettle tv h dryer plug by tv all dead as i only occupied the room for  hrs to sleep i just had to cope no time to complain get it sorted all very inconvenient i reported it to the desk as i left the room was   i think breakfast was good pillows poor i walk with a stick and my room was a really long way from the lifts the ice machine wasn t working and the mini bar was empty the pillows were very hard and quite uncomfortable the staff were super friendly and helpful the food in the aroma restaurant was incredible and the choice of breakfast was amazing only two tea bags in room and very little milk had to ask for rubber bath mat and extra pillows as there was only one half size pillow on each bed arranged a taxi at the check in desk at   for pick up at   this did not arrive until     and traffic was so bad we had to walk a long way to our destination if we requested anything extra it was attended to immediately had a small fridge in room which was empty for our use the shower took a while to warm up and there was an issue with the food in saturday but the staff are really nice it just seems a little over priced no positive shower and bathroom dated and not terribly clean on the shower screen left wine bottle behind curtain bed comfortable and provided with extra pillows when requested breakfast was good but it can be improved room as in all london not so spacious for an executive room in general we enjoyed our stay staff very helpful had to call security as there was a disturbance on my floor keeping us awake all night and coffee machine didn t work staff and hotel was very good having to wait   minutes for tea coffee at breakfast we were chosen as guests of the day so got an upgrade to an executive room and free drinks in the bar the room was really hot and air con just seemed to blow out hot air our room key didn t work had to visit reception   times before it was sorted this took awhile when you are on the  th floor wouldn t go there again breakfast was very good nothing upgraded to premium suites on arrival after being advised we were guests of the day free drinks at the bar free breakfast and bigger room also great location for city centre coffee machine in room didn t work and wasn t attended to apparent failure of hot water boiler meant tea late at breakfast restaurant appeared to close   minutes early on saturday evening but alternatives were offered and food and service at the bar were good friendly staff at check in general cleanliness and overall efficiency great location for hammersmith apollo which was a key feature of the booking breakfast good as was meal in bar we wasn t told that there was a building site just across the way so not a very nice awakening would of liked the choice of bath or shower room was good and comfortable shower was great food was very good rooms were very very hot inside changed rooms twice due to the rooms being stuffy and hot i also started getting heat spots and notified reception over   times and nothing was ever done air conditioning machine did not work room is to small and compact they claim to call it an executive room there was nothing executive about the room all a marketing spiel do not fall for this trapno positive the approach to the hotel is dark and potentially dangerous when wet and without lighting there were street lamps on the walkway but they were never lit there was also a lot of rubbish around which i feel a good hotel would have taken responsibility for cleaning the worst part room   filled the jug on the espresso machine from the bathroom tap it came out bright green soapy with bits floating in it it also had a sewage smell not nice to brush your teeth in reported to reception twice after it was still smelling horrible the next morning they said they would report it and get back to me by email which hasn t happened i kept a sample of the water in case we became ill very disappointing service for the price great location for eventim apollo theatre nice walk round hammersmith bridge a   minute walk away breakfast excellent make sure you spot the regular toaster lots of channels on tv nice toiletries very nice staff in breakfast room nothing helpful polite staff spacious immaculate and clean premier executive room comfortable bed dinner in the artisan grill and buffet breakfast both excellent good wifi only a few minutes walk from hammersmith tube check in very slow lady who checked us in said sorry and that she upgraded our room but when we got to room was no upgrade we had paid for a superior room anyway also parking was very expensive good hotel if going to show at apollo as it   mins walk breakfast very good staff friendly and good service in bar for food and drinks breakfast expensive coffee maker bottle not clean hair found on bath room tilewall right after when check in the bed is good comfort big size and sofa is good no negative we were upgraded as we were picked as guests of the day to top floor suite and free breakfast which had everything you could imagine   minutes from our venue that we were attending great hotel bed was bit firm but again it s a personal choice good size room with good layout for everything like cupboard ironing board small fridge sitting area with good size sofa and writing desk washroom with bath tub was good too at check in it was quite busy but staff was very active professional and courteous my special thanks to rafealea the only little niggle was when we got back to the hotel at     we ordered drinks at the bar and then asked for food people around us were eating and the barman told us it was getting busy and to go over to the restaurant to eat we waited for our drinks and headed over to the restaurant which was closed we have a feeling that he was trying to avoid having to work later than possible which we do understand but thought a little cheeky it didn t spoil our stay though we were upgraded and offered a free breakfast which was very kind when booking i had asked for a top floor room which we were given the car parking discount saved us a lot of money we found the whole experience great and will definitely be using your hotels again thank you so much power cut for a few hours one morning not notified only told when we phoned and asked therefore no hot water either so wasted half day waiting for a shower no free drink voucher or the like for the inconvenience asked for extra pillows never arrived apparently i d booked wrong check out date saturday instead of sunday even though on check in the receptionist informed me i could arrange late check out on sunday if i needed it and so asked to book a further night was told that they had no rooms and i had half an hour to get my bags asked for her help but she was completely unhelpful bordering on rude and said well we have no rooms here no suggestions for other hotels in the area etc would not use again or recommend no positive a note under everyonesdoor about the power outage and to say breakfast was still available would have been good also no apologies given at reception on way out or by email after for the inconvenience always friendly no electricity due to power cut but very stressful especially as morning of a job interview paid for breakfast deal but had luke warm tea and cereal instead of cooked breakfast not hotels fault but no apology or explanation from staff an expensive stay for nothing extra disappointed friendly welcome room clean and warm our room key stopped working and it was a long walk back to reception from our room to ask for help we also experienced a power cut which although not the hotels fault proved problematic when trying to use the bathroom early in the morning the staff were extremely helpful particularly when sorting out problems no negative the check in was smooth and the staff were very courteous esp ms serena we were given a room upgrade and complimentary breakfast too breakfast was excellent overall a very satisfying experience the room was cold there was only one pillow per person with no extra pillows available the location is good the lobby and reception area are very clean the food breakfast is fine but the room service dinner i had was very disappointing and room services is never cheap working away and long hours i didn t get to eat until about    pm receiving a burnt bottomed rock hard pizza with poor flavours is not what you need after a long travel day i couldn t finish it so for me it was a waste of money the location staff and facilities were great i had a quick and easy time checking in and the robe slippers coffee machine were a great touch toilet could be prepered better for   people just one set  ml of shower gel and shampoo some pilows bit hard and not comfy great bufet breakfast clean rooms windows open what is plus staff kind and helpfull beautiful reception restaurant close to central hammersmith not so far to different areas several restaurants around access is not easy and was made even more difficult from the car park as the main lifts were out of order also no food available after   when many guests are returning from the theatre concerts clubs etc no positive temperature in the whole hotel was too high room especially so even with thermostat set on minimum staff very helpful breakfast hot and tasty room very clean the breakfast was a little expensive so we passed we booked as we were going to the eventim apollo and the location is perfect just a five minute walk the bed was really comfortable and the bar staff were very friendly great facilities and a great overnight stay it was a shame we were not staying longer i think the trump when u are going to underground its either u are going to use stairs or trump if u have luggage u need to use the trump the best hotel in london the staff were very accomodating wifi is ok there was nothing that i did not like room very spacious bed very comfortable staff seemed very friendly very clean and tidy throughout would definitely recommend both pedestrian entrances to this hotel were potentially unsafe after dark being poorly lit and easy for attackers to strike even as a couple we felt unsafe and we are used to london the room was very quiet and contained everything necessary for a comfortable overnight stop continental breakfast poor value for money and some items forgotten on both mornings a la carte restaurant very expensive and poor value for money double bed was not very comfortable easy express check out breakfast was warm not hot our room was not serviced during our two nights stay hence no clean towels etc keycards expired the first evening and we were missing from the breakfast list plenty for breakfast check in on tablet took si much time porter service not available and noone there to pick up my luggage spent like   minutes going up and down with all my bags wifi is unsecured so my business laptop could not connect due to insufficient security room could be furnished more practically guest of the day upgrade there are very less infact zero dine in options for muslims we wanted to try fish and chips but even it was cooked in liquor so we ordered food from outside we booked stayed in executive room which was quite nice we were also shown the twin room but executive room is far superior spacious clean comfortable great location we used sofa cum bed as our second bed location is very good we stayed for   nights i left behind a bottle of expensive perfume i d just received as a gift however when i contacted the hotel they said the housekeeping team hadn t handed it in no positive the check in system is complicated using ipads they get you to sit down with a staff member and it all takes quite some minutes which is annoying when you have pre booked with all the info and are tired from a long flight the room was spacious and comfortable the location was quiet the hotel is in easy walking distance from the tube station which is on the piccadilly line so great for arriving from heathrow the rooms were fine but the decor in our room was very bland could do with a splash of colour bathroom a bit tired toilet was leaking from the base breakfast was excellent one of the best i have ever had in a hotel staff were lovely we had a problem with the safe in our room and this was rectified very promptly room was on the third floor and was close to some sort of loud speaker convention that was being held that weekend the staff could have informed us of the event great location friendly staff and comfortable room bar staff could be a bit more friendly and aware of who to serve next four lifts but not all working great location a warm welcome from diego lovely room spacious and clean cleaners started work very early and were very noisy outside the room and woke us we put the sign on the door saying do not disturb and the cleaner still came in reception staff were excellent and friendlyno negative a modern classic hotel with a all round warmth and friendly the staff were excellent in all area s particularly at front desk nothing seemed to be a problem they helped were polite and above noticed other guests waiting and acknowledged them well appointed room with comfy bed and crisp white linen this hotel was recommended to us and we will definitely pass on our recommendations see you on our next visit to cologne sharon morgan sept   no negative very luckily selected as the guest of the day and get the room upgraded to a premium executive room with a complimentary breakfast friendly staff nice facilities and especially quiet room an excellent experience no negative the staff were really helpfull the room was excellent and the breakfast was great the hotel location is ideal for the tube and car parking is good what more could you ask for nothing couldn t fault it at all the bed was amazing best nights sleep i ve had in a long time staff were always polite friendly helpful and very welcoming perfectly located for all our needs a little bit walk from metro   min but not so bad staff not so cheerful proper   star hotel and relative chap price bus stop next to it and busses     will take you to the centre in no time fair distance from hammersmith metro hammersmith is very convenient station many lines intercept the car parking is a rip off and i was very disappointed with my meal at the artisan restaurant i had a steak which was high on price but low on quality i ve had far better steaks for much less money i ate it because it was my partner s birthday and didn t want any hassle otherwise i would ve most certainly made a complaint the whole hotel looked very nice and it was in a very good location close to the underground the room was also very nice and clean good facilities with internet access the room was very very cold the heating wouldn t work no extra pillows i might as well slept on a irioning blared very uncomfortable pillows duvet was so thin i had to sleep with socks jumper today i actually feel so ill sleeping like that the charger plug socket wouldn t work properly couldn t even charge my phone next to me had to getting up in the night to charge it as i came in to check in the girl asked my name then says sorry nothing under your name needed some sort of proof of booking what like i was lying that s how it felt went into my emails found the booking ref then realised she made a error how to spell my surname when i actually spent it out for her lal is that really hard to spell i dnt want to made to fell like i wasn t good enough for your hotel don t no what image i had on people only thing i liked was how close it was near the tube station showers were clean being awoken by the local building works at    am appreciate this is not the hotel s fault but this still put a damper on an otherwise faultless stay all aspects of the stay were good apart from what didn t you like above the hotel is weirdly arranged at ground level with two entrances both signposted main entrance and neither staffed at night reception is on the floor above this caused problems when i booked a taxi home and it went to the wrong entrance the staff were very helpful whenever i had problems including helping me contact my taxi firm reception was well staffed at all times when needed there were extra staff equipped with tablets to speed handling the room was spacious breakfast wasn t included in the price and our coffee machine didn t work loved the quality of the hotel and the comfort of the beds was impressed with the facilities in our room although the coffee machine did not work at   per night it would have been great if breakfast was included overall i was impressed with the hotel and would definitely stay there again cleaned our room at     pm just when we had come back for a rest after being out all day before going out to a show so we had to wait in reception for   minutes buffet breakfast nice bar area very friendly staff and got a room upgrade with a good view and a great little coffee maker thought booking com indicated breakfast included on prices before i booked but it wasn t i have stayed here before breakfast was good so this was a factor in booking here again we didn t have breakfast this time as would have been   x     extra perfect for eventim apollonius gig bathroom was old and uncomfortable loud construction outside of the hotel most of the furniture was worn out too expensive for whay they offer superior room very good breakfast and lovelly breakfast area nice receptione founds stains on the towels sleeper couch was poor had arranged late checkout but the staff checked us out prematurely and we were unable to get back into our room very rudely they said they had no record of our late checkout request i contacted novotel directly and they promised to look after us at our next stay the following week unfortunately they didn t fulfill this promse price per night was poor value for money check in and breakfast staff we re amazing a lady by the name of felicia specifically was really warm and made our breakfast really special in room dining was great no negative the breakfast was just amazing the best i ve ever had in a hotel and the bed was really comfortable i do not have any cons to add i had a great experience the room charge of   for breakfast when waiting time was incurred in the dining room also laundry charges very high for holiday guests with no other choice no positive breakfast was very poor greasy bacon was hard all left under lights too long had to ask for milk bread fruit etc to be filled up both mornings not wot we expect from your hotelsno positive had to wait to be seated a while no cups cutlery on table think this is because it is just very busy plenty of food on offer there are a few buffet tables as there are a lot of seatsso didn t have to wait a little awkward to find entrance from the underground station though the road layout doesn t help after a long and difficult journey being told i was customer of the day and given an upgrade to a great room with a view across to central london was wonderful even without that this seemed good value compared to many other hotels i ve stayed in in london clean and crisp well furnished room comfy bed great staff and a good breakfast thank you view was of the car park parking very very expensive the a la carte restaurant was very expensive for what it was rooms were very clean liked the technology in room bose speakers that played in your bathroom breakfast was fantastic system at reception if busy it can be quite a wait to get hold of staff that said once it is your turn staff couldn t be more helpful excellently situated in central london easy access to bus and tube stations very helpful staff i will definitely use this venue again internal lock missing from the door into the room although this was fixed when i pointed it out to the girl who cleans the room no water bottles and no shower caps anymore only   pillows for   beds apparently we the customer don t want or use these items so if you want them you have to ask house keeping large comfy beds nice shower gel and shampoo every room has a small fridge no negative we were chosen as guest of the day and got an upgrade breakfast was great so i d book it in future we always enjoy this novotel the staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable restaurant staff at breakfast herded us like cattle and even tried to take plates we were still eating from without a single word or eye contact sadly we couldn t make use of free drink at the bar as there was a convention on and nowhere for us to sit bed was uncomfortable fantastic reception staff and room service staff and wonderful to be upgraded on arrival lovely spacious room at check in i was asked if i had stayed at the hotel before the receptionist then went into a back room for a very long time and i was left standing at the desk when she returned i was asked if i had any outstanding balance to pay from my last visit which i did not i was made to feel very uncomfortable by the delay and felt as if i was being accused of something underhand excellent breakfast location and staff petty annoyance was the mattress was too soft so i couldn t sleep well that s personal preference though as each to there own the staff were fantastic and the location was just right for where we were place could do with tidying up paint job there was plaster peeling off in places very expensive for what you get breakfast is great but service was lacking at times had to ask for coffee   times before service and that wasn t on the busy day had a conference on on one of the days but we hadn t been warned ended up queuing for breakfast not what we expected if they had said been warned we would have come down earlier or atleast wouldn t be mentioning it here car parked     an hour we parked up at a tube station for our duration and paid   a day unlikely to use again it s close to a tube station not a lot really bedding looked a little worn in places but was perfectly clean very minor staff friendly room clean and tidy quiet well organised great breakfast perfect location for tube also ideal having a car park under the hotel second visit to hotel will definitely use again when coming to london the room size the lighting is not enough in the room the bed is not that comfy i didn t like the attitude of one of the staffs who brought me a dental kit its not value of money the reception area and the other facilities in the hotel an extra pillow and extra blanket per bed would have been perfect could have asked but didn t want to bother anyone it s not a deal breaker location location location friendly helpful staff very busy place bit of a wait for the lift at times the gym was hot smelly and poorly ventilated and the wifi wasn t always overly reliable handy for that end of london staff very helpful and friendly the room was clean and well equipped on arrival no soap shampoo etc in room quickly remedied after informing staff mostly friendly and efficient staff on a couple of occasions staff were too busy to offer timely service room was a good standard everything was presented well and worked as it should a no hassle enjoyable stay was on a group tour and we had no wifi was told we had wifi in the lobby but this was very limited also the room keys kept locking us out twice i had to go down to have the keys reset breakfast was amazing so much variety of cold and hot food no negative arrived at reception after a hectic day of travelling to be told that as a first time guest i was one of their guests of the day which meant a free upgrade to an executive room and free breakfast as surprises go that s hard to top staff were excellent throughout rooms were splendidly clean and comfortable i d happily come back again the price of breakfast plug on bath the facilities were good hair dryer in both room and bathroom the tv could be moved so to be seen anywhere in the room slightly expensive with no breakfast included have stayed often and normally have breakfast included no breakfast included the bed was really comfy and room really great hotel took my bank card details on check in i thought as a guarantee pay the balance on checkout but then when i had left the hotel to head into london for the afternoon tried to take payment without me being present entering a pin number my bank santander blocked the request and   others from the hotel all different amounts with the first being nearly   more than the total amount for the weekend santander then blocked the card couldn t unblock until the following morning praise to santander not happy with the hotel and told them so got apologies and   free drinks at the bar i would use the hotel again but just clarify on check in when they want payment and don t hand over your card like i did room was clean bed was comfy enough and big selection for breakfast despite having   lifts we seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time waiting for them room was excellent save for the under pressured shower which tended to run hot lukewarm hot lukewarm the bathroom could be more cleaner but it s really just a hotel chain with a lack of personality nearby hammersmith the hotel have all the things you need no negative surprises there weren t enough staff to handle check ins outs we d been waiting in the queue for   minutes and were next in line to be served a pilot walks up to the side of us and is served immediately we were told the pilot was late for the airport sure the room was decent size and clean the bed was comfortable we were only in the room to sleep as we had a busy evening and an even busier following day we were on the other side of the hotel this time facing the street rather than the motor way so it was quieter room   extremely noisy above wedding party when i had particularly requested quiet room was offered another room at half past midnight not convenient to repack move and no reply to my complaint via email bad customer after service put off booking again serena and bar staff exceptional friendly and helpful n a we loved everything it was our anniversary and we were made to feel very special even given a free upgrade and free drinks staff were helpful happy and polite we had an amazing time thank you the room was uncomfortably hot and changing the aircon did not make any difference the shower is so uncomfortable and water was going everywhere you cannot properly stand in i the room is perfect for persons with special needs but for us it was really uncomfortable we stayed in room   staff service was great it was clean and location was perfect the entrance to the hotel was not clearly marked and was difficult to find in addition there we not signs around the building that were easy to view from the street so travelers coming from the underground station would have difficultly identifying the building very nice inside and the room was comfortable if i m being really picky it would have been useful to have had some hooks in the bathroom to hang things up also we only had one bathrobe and one pair of slippers for a double room but this was rectified once we notified reception great bar serving really nice food good gym breakfast was lovely bed very comfortable fabulous location if you re attending the eventim apollo overall a very lovely modern and stylish hotel the fact that the hotel is in a concrete jungle coming in the back as the front was closed was a bit scary at night the hotel is very big and the corridors are long and samey breakfast bar area and you could sit out doors and watch the european championships bar food was reasonable staff were helpful a conference of some   delegates held in the hotel made it extremely difficult to access areas such as the bar or to even find a place to sit this resulted in seeking food and drink outside the hotel food both bar meals and breakfast are excellent breakfast should be included as standard for the price of   pn wasn t going to pay an extra   for it when i can get a   sandwich around the corner the bed was great as was the water pressure an temperature it s huge long corridors but it is a big hotel so there is not a lot you can do   was really pleased with the room both size fittings bar service was quick friendly efficient check in staff were excellent the staff replaced my towels every night which was nice but not really necessary the restaurant was able to cater for my dietary requirements which made my stay much easier hotel charges are abnormal and also the necessities are also being charged by the hotel such as plug for charger which i feel should be provided by the hotel hotel is situated at the centre whereby market and the train station are at a walking distance there was no hotel information in the room usually there s a little book or folder only a little thing if i had to put a negative staff were excellent especially the guy who checked us in we flew in to heathrow so the location on the piccadilly line was perfect easy for us to get to from the airport and just as easy to get into london dreadful awful directions really infuriating impossible to work out where the residents car park is when you arrive just looks like a normal paying car park and it is not clear that it is for residents once the car was unloaded we headed to the signs for reception and the lift but the lift was not working and the sign saying use alternative stairs lift points to a wall it took ages to find stairs as there are no signs we found some stairs and then we had to walk up numerous flights with all our luggage awful start to our stay breakfast the staff that cleared away the tables need to be more courteous the lady who cleared the table as we were shown to our seat seemed very unhappy and did not want to be there then when i had finished eating but my husband was still half way through a cooked breakfast a waiter came and cleared everything away apart from his plate and knife and fork teapot side plate cups and glasses everything he was still eating very rude i also don t want to see a manager stood there with her arms folded looking everyone up and down as they pass through very unprofessional and then give a member of staff a dressing down in front of everyone if you have an issue with a staff member take it out the back please when checking out there were no signs showing how to get to the car park wandered aimlessly for a good few minutes the reception bar area has signs for everything except the car park and we had no idea where we came in so frustrating in the end we had to ask sign your hotel better novotel i stay in hotels all over the world regularly and this was a poor show loved the location ideal for the concert we had at the apollo hammersmith good choice at breakfast staff a bit miserable and i don t want to see a manager dressing down a member of staff in the breakfast hall do it out the back please and make them a little more courteous room clean and comfortable with a great view excellent reception staff when we checked in wish i could remember his name there was nothing to dislike everything was fine excellent hotel we last stayed here some   years ago and was very impressed then but was even more impressed this time what with the refurbishments that have been done since our last visit the room was very comfortable and the shower is one of the best that i have experienced in a hotel room likewise the breakfast and dining area was too we booked an executive room the decor was a little dated and bathroom bit tired but nothing to detract from enjoyment of our stay there the location was ideal for anyone visiting the hammersmith apollo within easy walking distance or wishing to explore further afield plenty of places to eat near the hotel we only ate breakfast in the hotel which was plentiful and very good choice of continental or cooked so cannot comment of quality or value of hotel s restaurant for dining didn t receive any slippers bathrobes etc and wasn t informed of where to get them from but was told that that was what our room would include the staff were friendly and checking in out was incredibly swift room service was great too our room had a problem with the sockets i reported it early evening to one of the chambermaids came back from a concert nothing resolved told reception who were unable to fix it offered another room at    am but husband was asleep nothing worked not television hairdryer or kettle would not have expected this when we paid   for the room staff location the shower in our room could be bigger i found it a bit claustrophobic lifts are slow the two lifts going to street level were out of order which was a bit of a nuisance the bar could stay open a little later at weekends with bar snacks available until close the hotel is in a great location staff are really polite and helpful the standard of the hotel is high and the food is excellent i especially like the buffet dinner menu the beds are extremely comfortable it s not the easiest hotel to find your way in to and when we did find an entrance the lift was not working so we had to phone reception who told us how to find the main entrance of the hotel we were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to an executive room and also with a free full breakfast no negative a nice surprise to be upgraded for both rooms i d booked and guest of the day status staff were friendly and helpful location so close to apollo is a good reason for staying comfortable with good bar and restaurant facilities no tv in public rooms ie no wimbledon my cc was swiped at noon without me being present despite the fact that i told reception that i wasn t leaving till the afternoon i had checked out of my room and left my car in the garage and my suitcase with the porter breakfast was good reception area there seemed to be no system as some staff were behind a desk and others seemed to approach guests to check in or help i was waiting for a while and was overlooked by two staff before i went to a free receptionist behind a desk very nice comfortable room unable to get an answer from the hotel telephone to revise my reservation and so forfeiting my payment but in particular with using booking com who did not help in resolving the issue which was in minutes of making the reservation through booking com who reserved two rooms under different conditions as advertised maybe a very small part of this was my error but still not acceptable no positive car parking too expensive my room was   and my car parking was   very dis satisfied with this and will not stay again due to car park price which is a shame very friendly staff lovely hotel very nice room and service throughout a little off the main street within walking distance of nearest underground station hammersmith each connecting to centre of the city and to heathrow all terminals i asked to only pre authorize my credit card as i was going to pay whole accommodation and extras on cash they said ok but they finally charged my card as they said by mistake i requested to have my shirts ironned but they told me that they do not offer this facility and that i should do it by myself as i had an iron and ironboard in my room despite the fact that inside the room they had a laundry list including a price for ironing shirts for a   hotel they had no bathrobes slippers bathroom amenities only shampoo shower gel and soap felt that i should use them very carefully as they would have not replace them if run out in the room food is average     sterling for room service charge are they serious better say i don t want to offer this service do not order reception staff did not give any information upon check in e g available restaurants breakfast hours e t c i even had to ask for directions to my room breakfast was fine service staff was good and with a smile nothing it was all good and just what we needed if i am being picky the bathroom could do with a bit of a freshen up but thats it fantastic staff who showed us a good way to get to the apollo or our concert shower in the room was fab comfortable bed as well oh i have to mention the burger we bought from the room service menu it was amazing i am tempted to go back just to have another we used the bar after the concert and it was lovely all in all if we have another concert at the apollo we will definitely stay here no negative the staff where extremely helpful an polite evening meal was fantastic quality as was the breakfast had the buffet dinner and breakfast lots to choose from again fantastic quality would highly recommend and will stay again the room was excellent and very clean no negative i particularly liked the excellent customer service the hotel maintenance guy david fixed the retractable handle of my carry on luggage that got detached it was very much appreciated because we were just starting our holiday and my other option was to find a samsonite service center in london to take it to and i m not sure if they were going to be able to repair it quickly the reception staff was always helpful and accommodating the breakfast buffet was great and the best we had in the hotels we stayed in during our   week holiday in london and europe service rooms are run down our room basin was not draining was not fixed till next day breakfast was a very poor quality the servers were very rood i have lot to say but terrible experience that s all i want to say terrible poor bad service worst than   star motel the fact that we had to pay     per hour for parking after paying   per night to stay in the hotel was shocking and also our power went off whilst we were getting ready in the morning and the staff didn t seem bothered lastly a   charge was added to the bill incase we used room service which we wasn t told about luckily we didn t have to pay this at the end no positive the parking fees are extortionate the staff at the hotel forgot to validate our ticket and when brought to his and the managers attention it took an hour to sort and we didn t even get an apology no positive room could have done with a little decorative updating but nothing major wrong with it really large hotel just off the main road in hammersmith hotel has underground parking and it s just   mins walk to the tube station great view of central london from my room restaurants on premises too expensive could not get in and out of shower easily could not figure out how to turn on shower bed was great close to shopping staff was tremendously helpful from the time we checked inno negative the staff were excellent all of them were extremely polite and very helpful the bar had a great atmosphere and was a lovely place to spend an evening the food was good too the location was ideal a short and easy tube journey into central london there were very few power sockets in the room the drinks in the fridge and bar were very expensive the staff were very friendly and helpful there was a problem with my door lock and the maintenance guy fixed it very quickly the sound of the ice machine just outside our room would benefit from a quieter running motor however when we mentioned this to the staff on our arrival we were offered a change of room we declined because this room had views over the central london skyline we had a superior room everything we needed for our stay was available room was kept perfectly clean each day you can get a good quality quick buffet evening meal hotel well placed for the tube bus station and the eventim apollo where we were seeing a concert no negative the staff were lovely and went the extra mile to welcome us they even sent a cake and birthday card to our room whilst we were out at a concert as the stay was part of our daughters  th birthday celebrations breakfast was amazing too such a fabulous variety location atmosphere no real gym for the size of the hotel no sauna at all staff was very helpful huge room with very comfortable bed and pillows huge bathroom the lift was out of order a cleaner tried to enter the room at    am and parking was too expensive   for overnight and that was with a discount staff scruffy run down approach to hotel room was very spartan in decoration definitely no frills air conditioning is just a fan totally ineffective and couldn t open windows due to traffic noise so room was extremely hot and stuffy spot of fresh blood on one of our pillows just one small bottle of water in room barely adequate toiletries in bathroom     for breakfast is outrageous overall impression is penny pinching meanness helpful friendly staff at check in good sized room   the ice maker wasn t working on our floor   there wasn t an ice bucket   the mini fridge didn t work   the outlet by tv didn t work so we only had one working outlet   there wasn t any wash cloths to wash our faces so we used the hand towels   the extra lock to prevent someone getting in located on top half of the door was broken see picture the staff was kind and the lounge restaurant was great the bed was comfortable the hair found inside the sausage at breakfast and some of the hot food trays were empty the car park pricing way too much for an overnight stay comfortable room queue very long and slow for breakfast bed pillows not the best bluetooth speaker in room didn t work one of the plug sockets in room didn t work good location for olympia bar staff really good and friendly i got called ma am when i m a sir there were cracks in the paintwork and tiles in the bathroom and the shower went from luke warm to scolding hot by it s own volition the location was absolutely ideal and the staff were friendly breakfast was excellent but pricey compared to cost of stay and bar prices no pool room and en suite very well set out and very clean with great shower hairdryers beside mirrors large and comfortable single beds and no feather pillows good staff attitude helpful and friendly yet respectful which made for a relaxed stay very convenient for the hammersmith apollo and the piccadilly line when we walked into the hotel there was no reception desk it was up another floor and no one helped us to find the reception floor even though staff were around it was a rather business hotel which did make us feel slightly uncomfortable as the staff didn t help us as much as we weren t clients or there for meetings everyone should be treated individually it wasn t only us staying there who felt this way the breakfast was also at a ridiculous price the room was clean as was the whole hotel and it was very comfortable and relaxing value for money not great breakfast is way too expensive at     for a cooked english breakfast and not very nice if you want it delivered to your room they tell you it s only a four pound supplement on top of a continental breakfast but then say there is a   poind tray charge which is a ridiculous claim to make why not just admot you re charging     to bring a cooked breakfast to the room bath was tiny too overall though we were satified with the hotel lovely and comfortable staff are a credit to the place and location is handy enough clean hotel also i stayed with my cousin in a twin room and once again we found the heating was far too stifling even when turned down the system isn t easy to control yes the beds are very comfy and the breakfast is excellent the staff really are the star people immensely courteous and helpful no negative the whole stay abliet   night my  th was excellent and the breakfast was awesome thank you and we very much look forward to another visit lesley dean signage to the reception area from outside was not very clear my taxi driver had to go around the car park area to distinguish the conference entrance to the hotel entrance as from the outside it is not clear that reception is on the first floor buffet dinner was nice but the desserts were disappointing they tasted like defrosted cakes room was very clean and bed very comfy except for the pillows but that may be a personal thing i was given a free upgrade on check in which made my stay staff were friendly and helpful at all times the location of the hotel to the tube and bus station was amazing being less than a   minute walk i would certainly return the price of car park this shouldn t be an extra cost showers very dangerous as the temperature fluctuates regularly which left me with a burn on my shoulder the temperature goes scolding hot then cold could be very dangerous if a baby infant was using beds very comfy staff were lovely and helpful tv didn t work but we didn t stay in the room to use it as we travelled down for a gig fantastic from check in to check out attentive staff and a lovely welcoming atmosphere absolutely loved my stay no negative perfect place to stay as we were only minutes away from the apollo where we needed to be that evening staff were lovely and breakfast was excellent booked an executive room air conditioning did not work shower had a mind of its own and decided to cycle the temperature between ice cold and burning hot no matter what setting the carpet in the room was very dirty hairs everywhere friendly staff nice design and had a great meal in the la carte restaurant stained carpet in room   all in all carpets in rooms and corridors could do with an up grade very dingy no shower caps in bathrooms en suite comfortable bed unmanned reception ie not enough staff for the number of people checking in nobody made an executive decision to call for help i therefore stopped a walking by member of staff and asked them to help at reception which reduced the queue by half no positive my wife not liking lifts and we were on the top floor however once the receptionist learnt of this they immediately offered to move us very comfy clean and modern room friendly forward polite pleasant and professional staff always on hand and happy to help the only thing i don t like is the view but it s not that important pretty good hotel and a very convenient location to commute from heathrow and to the centre of london friendly staff and comfortable bed i have been there many times in the past years also with my family and we all like it there access to reception is poor access either via a dark undercroft and take a lift to the first floor reception or via external poorly maintained stairs and a dated upper paved area but once inside it s fine no positive no bin liners in bins must have been forgotten no big deal wifi speed was slow but connecting was simple lovely reception staff dual head shower for full overhead or standard showering without fuss comfy bed quiet room top floor not facing roads bluetooth bose speaker in room good coffee machine in room ironing board iron and hair dryer also room service should really have been collected leftover food was left in room overnight if the tray needs to be put outside of the door for collection then perhaps this needs to be made clear very helpful staff breakfast was very good indeed food for room service was delivered very hot and food portions were great windows had secondary glazing so the room was nice and quite even though on third floor near to main road very handy for eventim apollo the bed was too hard and the shower head wouldn t stay upright breakfast although very nice was expensive bluetooth speaker in the room size of room nothing to do with the hotel but we were on a floor with alot of noisy and rowdy youngsters who did wake us up a fair few times very clean and fairly modern no bad things to say at all would highly recommend rooms lovely as they were very modern and nice and roomy i liked the steam resistant mirror and the docking station also very handy to the tube so the location was great overall a comfortable stay only thing was the carpeted room smelled a bit old exceptional service friendly and helpful we arrived from the airport much earlier than the expected check in time but the staff member was very accommodating and allowed us to check in very much appreciated after a long haul flight bed was huge but was a bit on the firm side the staff were very pleasant and helpful we also had a free upgrade which was most appreciated the location was good with the tube a few minutes walk away i was not very impressed with the breakfast food but variety was ok for a   star hotel food could be better quality and tastier hotel bar is really good great for a drink and chilling location was great connection with   tube lines staff was friendly house keeping staff was great rooms are very clean matresses are very comfortable cleaners in the morning kept knocking on my door a few just let themselves in while was present staff was very friendly and i would recommend that again it is a bit far from everything really big building with no pleasant atmosphere rather small rooms with very basic equipment the bathroom was small the toilet did not work properly and staff was not very helpful i came here because it was close to my meeting point not much it is close to hammersmith tube station and bus station location was good for the event at the apollo however a little way out of central london hotel was great nice public areas and bar and they have us an upgrade which was nice of them really good selection at breakfast the parking was a little pricey for a weekend stay it was a flat     per hour so an overnight stay when you checked in a little early was nearly     they should look to have a   night cap for residents or something similar just a thought great hotel nice lobby and bar area check in was very quick and efficient we stayed previous and they double scanned our card and took additional money that took some time to work out and have put back in our account so i would recommend paying upfront and not presenting a card for extras room was good size with comfy bed and good bathroom and shower facility good location a five to ten minute walk to hammersmith apollo and a five to seven minute walk to hammersmith tube station all in all a good stay no negative both the reception and convention staff were helpful welcoming and superbly efficient requests were responded to swiftly and effectively nothing was too much trouble extremely well trained highly commendable no negative on arrival we were greeted by aurelia at reception she upgraded us to an executive room and we were given vouchers for a free glass of prosecco each at the bar we instantly felt quite special thanks to her and her excellent service we ate at the bar in the everning we had the mini burgers the chicken ones were too pink for our taste so we sent them back they brought us new ones but these were the same i guess that s just how they do them our waiter did tell us he knew they were cooked because they were finished in the microwave we were given a free glass of wine to compensate us for the dissappointment the room was super comfortable excellent bed great shower and fabulous view of the city skyline having a nespresso machine that we were free to use was a lovely touch too we had breakfast in the aroma buffet and it was excellent there was no shortage of food and fresh food kept arriving all the while overall a very good experience would visit this hotel again the bed was a bit hard for me maybe that s a personal choice but i like beds a little softer bedding all very nice though and otherwise everything was very comfortable reception staff were very friendly and helpful i left my purse in a restaurant and they were very sympathetic looked up the local police station and i actually got it back aurelia checked us in and saw us later but not sure who the other member of the team was called both lovely though oh my days the beds are so hard they make a big thing about how fantastic there new beds are but boy don t think anyone who made the decision to purchase them have ever tried sleeping in them fantastic staff and efficient service the restaurants are not structured the bar manager didn t really have a clue i would definitely recommend sorting the staff and menu out as the food was delicious it just weren t put on menu as it should be we had a really warm welcome and felt at ease at the hotel the bar menu not explaining what is in a meal and the staff not saying either resulting in an over ordering of food the bed was comfortable the breakfast was good staff were helpful poor room insulation and hotel was very busy with large groups of noisy neighbours rooms on hot side and ac very noisy spacious room for london hotel good value for money for london it was really really warm at night even with the windows open as much as they could go it made for restless sleep perfect location for where i needed to be very central drinks in the bar were lovely we didn t pay for food as     per person per night for breakfast is a ridiculous amount to pay the hotel was situated in a convenient place and was very nice smoking rooms would have been desirable as it was a long trip to go up and down to smoke the room was spacious and included many useful features close to elevators which was a huge bonus was able to leave luggage safely and securely after check out staff were friendly and helpful coffee cups were dirty drip marks still on them after room had been cleaned staff were extremely helpful fixed a thermostat problem when they said they would when we went to the restaurant at     one night just for dessert it had closed but david restaurant manager ordered room service for us and looked after us brilliantly although hotel was very busy the bedroom areas were quiet and we slept great very comfy beds and pillows breakfast was very good and again the service from staff was spot on the location also worked very well for us bed was not comfortable and room carpet was very stained and needed replacing not just cleaned we were told that tv had pay per view channels but not the case ordered a lamb curry from room service and a veggie curry was delivered this was taken off our bill but only after complaining twice staff very goodno negative good value for money close to the venue we needed and the underground stations good friendly staff clean rooms and very comfy and warm we wanted for nothing i didn t like how loud it was at night i didn t know whether to complain to reception as our neighbour was talking loudly until  am in the morning huge spacey room excellent customer service main reception bottom reception less so nice modern hotel with great location to all central tube lines and to victoria coach station room service was appalling dirty dishes from evening meal left in corridor until after  pm the following day food mediocre delivered to room uncovered tried to call room service to complain about wrong order but rang and rang no answer rooms dismal staff sparse not a relaxing stay at all given a small double at first when i clearly showed my pre paid reservation for a superior with sofa bed complained and moved to the correct room type don t know what their   star rating is based on housekeeping made up beds left clean towels but dirty glasses were left in room heat in room unbearable during the night despite air con bed comfy good location only   robe and slippers when the room was for   adults temperature in the room was far too hot staff very friendly nothing too much trouble room was spacious bed very comfortable breakfast was excellent we waited over an hour to be served at the bar due to a massive queue and there only being two people on several people complained at reception but they didn t do anything about it also breakfast is ridiculously expensive at     per person really close to the apollo i found the bath a little too narrow at the one end pleasant staff easy to check in room was nice and clean plenty to choose from for breakfast and good opening times for breakfast close to the tube station given a choice of which floor we like to stay on walking back to the hotel the entrances were a bit dark on the same floor as reception some lights were not working bushes need cutting back and it felt a bit unsafe walking back from the tube in hammersmith we liked the bar and the food in the bar the staff were very helpful when we arrived late and we ate in the bar area the tv couldn t get most of the channels the safe was broken the price in the room for a bottle of water was ridiculous at     for a small bottle of evian on what planet do they think that is acceptable there was no extra blanket in the room either so i was cold also as a guest i was really disappointed to note the horrendous price for parking we booked a superior room nothing about this room was superior except the high price at   per night not worth the money try airbnb instead i liked the bathroom parking is extortionate to be charged at an hourly rate even when staying overnight which in my opinion is wrong when you are paying   pounds per night to stay staff were obviously not too sympathetic and said as it was a weekend we could park out on the street for free this was not my preference at all had to park a few streets away which was a bit of a walk in very cold weather i think a flat rate should be charged to park overnight carpet in our room was covered in stains of all shapes and sizes apart from that it was clean enough nice reception bar restaurant areasno negative stayed before but my last stay topped that breakfast was delicious the room was beautiful and the bed was the comfiest i would have happily paid double of what i paid for my stay looked sketchy from the outside so was anxious on arrival but as soon as walked in to reception my concerns disappeared would definitely stay again absolutely loved this stay the bathroom and modern decor in the rooms was right on point for us loved the shower too having stayed here a couple times was disappointed with our  st room door hanging of toilet and carpet filthy went to reception and they moved us overall just needs a bit of a face lift location good and staff helpful and hotel overall nice the view from the room was awful and the coffee in the breakfast room was pretty weak also the prices were very high   for a sandwich the room was very comfy and the breakfast was plentiful and a good choice every single member of staff i encountered was polite and friendly for the money the rooms were poor quality very old and out dated very worn out staff and cleanliness were top notch but lack of investment in the rooms really let it down you can get a lot better for a lot less staff were top notch very polite and efficient check in at reception staff were exceptionally welcoming some of the best i ve experienced recently arrangements for breakfast we had to miss the breakfast that we had payed for because the queue was horrendous we didn t even arrive downstairs late breakfast facilities need an overhaul clean luxurious rooms super convenient for hanmersmith apollo bar staff too busy spinning and dropping bottles and glasses rather than just dealing with the queue the location was perfect for our night out at the theatre there were only   plug sockets in the room   by the desk   by the mirror and   next to the bed which was broken annoying reasonable price for   nights stay for a couple in london room was very big which included a sofa and tv which was nice the hotel was an excellent walking distance from the restaurants and apollo theatre very poor slow wifi extremely expensive breakfast about   each don t know how good it was we just bought a bacon butty from a shop good location across road from the tube station about   minutes from central london room d cor a bit dated very comfortable bed quiet room no noise from neighbouring rooms or outside the staff were very helpful and friendly breakfast was tasty with a decent selection of food the carpets in our room were disgusting with stains all over they need changing or at least cleaning had to keep shoes on everything was good apart from the carpets which were disgusting the room was a bit warm and we couldn t work the air con came to see billy connolly at the hammersmith apollo our check in check out were both hassle free and easy with helpful friendly staff room was clean comfortable and we had a good nights sleep there was a really good choice at breakfast and plenty of seating well located for the underground too so we could do a little sightseeing would definitely stay again found the staff frosty at times and constantly talking between themselves one other guest commented he had been interrupted three times ordering from the bar check in was reasonably quick but having an i pad check in to speed things up looks a little daft when you have to be taken to   chip and pins devices to find one that works bathroom was very clean but not great when the door doesn t really close the bath shower was a bit disappointing the bedroom was okay but only marginally better than local competitors bed was reasonably comfortable the food was very good and excellent variety of eating facilities and a decent menu to support breakfast was well managed other facilities in the hotel internet caf gym etc were very good the one and only fault was that we had a power failure in our room in the morning which was a slight inconvenience but it was resolved quickly and efficiently the standard of the hotel was exceptional considering the size and amount of guests service was excellent and the food and beverages were of a high standard the new evening buffet in the aroma restaurant was top draw and delicious we were glad to be one of the first guests to experience it i would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel for another stay coffee at b fast shower was a little temperamental location was great for the apollo and very easy for public transport underground and buses room was very clean breakfast good and staff were very attentive and friendly would definitely stay here again we both found the bed and pillows not very comfortable mind you that could be that we are used to a tempur mattress and pillows expensive for just a room and no breakfast staff friendly and helpful good food great to have an expresso machine in the room no negative great location to eventim apollo easy check in and out clean and comfortable room and a fabulous breakfast in the morning couldn t ask for more no negative perfect for a concert at the hammersmith apollo hotel is huge but quiet no external noise breakfast was good although as its a buffet the food is generally lukewarm staff are very friendly helpful would definitely stay here again if in the area again no negative everrything was excellent the staff could t have been anymore helpful as a disabled customer i would recommend this hotel to any disabled traveler visiting london was disappointed that there was a charge for the car park as we were staying at the hotel didn t expect to pay it was not clear on the site i booked on i chose the hotel as my husband is disabled and can not walk far the breakfast was good staff helpful beds comfortable not enough tea and coffee in the room shower went hot and cold very friendly and helpful staff arrived early and was asked for any preference of room to which they catered for high up and overlooking the city not enough tea and coffee in the room but asked reception and  mins later it was all replenished the room was freezing couldn t take a shower because the bathroom was too cold i had to put my coat and cloths over the bed as there was no spare blanket the heater was useless i could not be bothered to call anyone at the time because it was gone    pm when we went to our room it s the only thing that spoilt an otherwise good hotel it was close to hammersnith apollo loved the decor and the look of the public areas the room was a little dated and for a   star hotel the cleanliness of our room should have been considerably better whilst the car park was very convenient the concessionary charge for guests of     hour for the car park seemed excessive it cost us   for an overnight stay just around the corner from the hammersmith apollo which was ideal as we were going to an event there and having a secure underground car park was a plus good and varied choice for breakfast n a great location only a few minutes walk from hammersmith underground and bus stations on site carparking available despite being a large hotel the desks were always fully manned resulting in very little waiting when checking in or out good access to free computers and unusually in my experience a working printer only one teabag each in the room when i asked for another teabag they gave me some but could not supply any milk very odd also when ordering drinks at the bar we were waiting for   minutes as there was only one person behind the bar two others just walking about and he was pratting around making a cocktail while flicking left and right location is ideal for the appollo and it is clean nothing as completely happy we were upgraded upon arrival staff were incredibly friendly helpful and professional the room was very clean and comfortable and convinient to the apollo we will use again and recommend the rude resident who was not very pleasant to one of your waitresses in the bar area very helpful and friendly staff the lady who booked my wife and i in and out was very professional and friendly and made my wife s birthday a very memorable one the bar staff had to put up with a rude resident which i felt was totally unjustified but she was polite at all times when she probably would ve been with in her rights to reply in the same manner but she didn t so well done to her i wish i had names but both served me in reception and the other in the bar plz trace them and thank them on our behalf julian lloyd room   stayed on  rd jan thanks againno negative stayed in room   at the end of the corridor and was really quiet usually at hotels we are kept awake by banging doors but we had a great night s sleep also had an amazing vodka martini in the bar room had been smoked in although it was a non smoking room in fact there was still a packet of marlboro sitting on the table when we went in each time you go into a hotel room you should feel like you are the first to use it this spoiled that illusion considerably guys at the bar after the show were being really fancy with their cocktails which was quite entertaining for a few minutes then i just wanted my pint of beer and g t and its took forever to get to the front of the queue especially after a busy show at the apollo maybe you could have separate cocktail queues somehow location weel trained friendly staff special mention to diego i think who checked us in the cleanses of the room was almost nill the bath badly designed there is no place to put your soap champion etc people who are working on the reception restaurants and every where s warm reception that for   a night it didn t include breakfast also the cost of parking in the hotel car park the room was wonderful fab view across london and only minutes from the hammersmith apollo our room was a little noisy with people walking past the room and there was somesort of banging noise but not a problem for a   night stay this is a great hotel for attending an event at the hammersmith apollo only   minutes walk and there are plenty of pubs around the apollo the room was clean and spacious enough for a   night stay the breakfast was also excellant with loads of choice and was very tasty staff are alos very friendly and efficent no negative brilliant welcome we won guest of the day and had a free room upgrade which was fantastic the room was excellent the receptionist was welcoming and friendly she gave us drinks vouchers as we were celebrating my husbands birthday the room was lovely the little extras were a nice touch front desk seemed a bit confused with payment card pre authourised but took payment at leaving full payment outstanding for another   days and showed on my a c as a debit even though paid in full sorted but no need for this hassle view of a hotel roof convenient for the apollo and tube short walking distance withdrawal of money from visa debit card for a deposit of   which l was informed the morning after will not be back in my account until the next week i m extremely angry about this not being explained location lots of space but very little seating in bar restaurant we wished to eat here but were unable to do so excellent location for the hammersmith apollo no negatives for me very friendly staff at reception and the bar facilities were very good and the rooms were clean and well maintained there was a problem with the heating when we returned in the evening of our first night but i would add that we were allocated a new room very quickly and given a voucher each for a drink at the bar to apologize in the restaraunt where we were sitting when my partner stood up the light was too low and he bumped his head on it the hotel was in a fantastic location for the train station and the apollo theatre we both enjoyed our stay very much abd just wished we could have stayed longer outside lighting deplorable dangerous even lift from car park not working sign at the lift with no directions to another car park very expensive bar staff slow and spoke together in a foreign language seemed very rude hardly any tea or coffee and a tiny biscuit each in our room i paid to have a bath and then couldn t use it as plug inefficient even when i stood on it and yes i do know how to use that type of plug wifi should not need time consuming e mail details awful view from window being close to where we were going the bed was very good approach to the hotel was dowdy and litter strewn with patches of not recent vomit on the steps the surfaces were uneven and had many insecure bricks or holes whet paving was missing we did not feel particularly safe when approaching it in the dark very convenient for venue apollo staff s grasp of english on reception was poor had to wait a long time for breakfast whilst staff milled about not clearing loads of vacant tables clean modern well located hotel artisan restaurant was slow service and bland food rooms were like saunas we had an executive room so god knows how bad the standard rooms were paid for breakfast but service was that slow on the buffet breakfast that the queue was out the restaurant and passed reception i paid   to stay here and quickly wanted to check out cause i was disgusted and then got hit with a   car park bill and that s with hotel occupants discount won t be staying here again closeness to the apollo only minor issue was that the tv wasn t working on the machines in the gym but all was not lost i had my ipod staff were friendly got an upgrade to an executive room really comfortable room with everything i needed for my stay bar facilities great and very popular on a saturday night fantastic location when visiting the apollo restaurant and bar couldn t cope with busy times and queues were long best breakfast in hammersmith which is   mins walk away the adjoining rooms meant we could hear neighbours talking in next room location we thought the price of     each was excessive for a breakfast when you can get a full breakfast down the road for   each didn t try it so maybe its the best breakfast you ll ever have it should be for that price anyway checking in staff were very helpful and friendly room was cleaned daily to a good standard the bed was comfortable and the room was warm with a thermostat allowing us to chose the temperature only a   minute walk from restaurants and the tube very convenient huge queues at the restaurant and bar both things obviously not big enough for the size of the hotel must be a recurring problem because they advertise that there will be delays good location friendly staff seemed unready for the post show rush in the bar breakfast was plentiful some it of questionable quality pancakes for example were old and hard very limited room service menu choice after  pm also very poor quality great location for the apollo the complete palava at trying to get a drink from the bar at getting in late as a resident i am used to being able to get a drink at the bar if it is open having to bring staff in from another area to come and pour a drink was a joke but the joke was on me being charged   for two gin and tonics london or not a complete rip off proximity to the hammersmith apollo it was freezing in our room bed felt damp it was so cold heating on to   degrees and still cold couldn t shower bathroom too cold heating only worked with blower which was too loud slept in clothes with coats on the bed as no extra blankets in the room location staff decor staff were not very accommodating to rectify a mistake i had made with the booking one room did not have slippers and robes and the coffee machine did not work i have emailed a complaint about this but did not even receive the courtesy of a replyno positive no bad experience all smiles we found the hotel to be ideally located near to bus and tube stations and the hammersmith apollo all of which are in walking distance our room was large with a comfortable king size bed there was an adequate choice on the dinner menu and plenty of choice for breakfast catering for most nationalities the receptionists and waiting staff were very friendly noise banging doors either side friends in out of rooms either side late in eve i was too cold couldn t warm room up bit grotty in shower bath needs re grouting hairs in bath etc friendly helpful staff great location no negative very friendly and welcoming place to stay love the late check out so didn t feel rushed at all my friend and i went to see the   cellos so great location and a very relaxing time and a amazing mums get away before the madness of christmas started alcoholic drinks a little expensive more information in the room and on website about the two hotel restaurants would be good really comfortable room with good sound insulation friendly helpful staff great breakfast good location for tube apollo theatre and local restaurants we ate in the hotel restaurant which was nice only complaint was the bed was a little hard and uncomfortable location was ideal for a visit to the hammersmith apollo or the lyric theatre excellent transport links as well superb breakfastno negative we were there to see a show at the apollo and it was close to there and shopping and really good bars close by staff were very helpful breakfast was great room was always nice and warm we got upgraded but got given the standard room key and didn t have time to say anything before we went out they asked us if wr would like to move to the upgraded room when we got back at  am and our standard room key wouldn t work the location was perfect as we needed to be close to the apollo the food tasted fine but i did end up feeling poorly it was very noisy i don t think there is any sound proofing at all as we could hear a family next door singing happy birthday in the early hours of the morning the room felt a little dated the staff were friendly the hotel was clean and it was a great location for what we required only negative is that customers are expected to queue in single file at the bar or you don t get served experienced staff would not have needed this sort of queue to determine who to serve in turn whether in a queue or stood at the bar easy access to hammersmith apollo and the tube station easy access to other facilities eg restaurants pubs comfortable room which had everything you would want friendly staff and easy check in cleanliness excellent cannot comment on the food as we did not eat there no negative from start to finish the experience at this hotel is top class the staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are high quality the location is great for the hammersmith apollo and the atmosphere in the bar area is lovely and relaxed would definitely stay here againno negative hotel was clean and staff very friendly and helpful it was located only  min walk from hammersmith underground station so very handy for travelling into central london we flew into stansted which was about  mins train journey to liverpool street then a further  mins to hammersmith on underground the hotel was also close to a shopping centre and places to eat however the restaurants in the hotel looked very nice our room looked like it had recently been decorated and the rest of hotel was under going renovation during our stay would definitely recommend for anyone visiting london no negative the hotel and its staff cannot do enough me and my wife visted london for her  th birthday once guest relations knew the reason of our stay they gave us certain little perks to make our stay the best it possibly could be and they did not disappoint thank you to novotel certainly the only hotel in london i will stay at from now on due to type of coffee machine in room it failed common fault with that brand the type of drop plug in the bath was damaged as shower was above it and people stand on it damaging the mechanism again a common fault but not unique excellent location for what we needed service and staff excellent and friendly if i had to be picky one barman left us standing at the bar whilst he was making drinks only to eventually ask us to take a seat and wait for table service we didn t mind but we wish that he had told us straight away so then we weren t stood there waiting the staff were lovely and friendly and the rooms were beautifuly clean and the food was deliciousno negative great location if you are going to the apollo or lyric theatre very useful for access to central london facilities and staff were very good we will certainly book to stay here again no negative from the moment we arrived to when we left all the staff were helpful and friendly excellent location for eventim apollo will definitely stay again food the lounge food was not very appetizing the aroma restaurant was closed most of the time the buffet was very expensive location location location no negative staff when we checked in anna felt us feel like home i always think that reception is the heart of a hotel the bed first seemed to be hard but ending being so comfortable and the shower was amazing great location near hammersmith tube station no negative great location just outside main london but still a tube and busses nearby the breakfest was good with enough choice for everybody and the staff was nice and helpfull there was enough space in our room and the bathroom had everything you need i recommend this hotel to my friends and family for their next london trip queuing up trying to check in and out was very slow and bad took some time you may have been short staffed at that time it was very hot in the room too water pressure wasn t the best location was great amenities such as docking station etc was good no negative staff were very friendly and helpful room was very clean and great view across london shower was excellent bar had a good atmosphere and a very pleasant seating area ac wasn t working in my room when the repair man came to fix it he couldn t and then told me that it s winter and people don t need the ac room was uncomfortably hot check out was a nightmare my cab driver was waiting to take me to the airport twice reception told me i had money to be owed however this was untrue after they checked their records i had the same problem at check in bell boy took over   min to bring my bags down from my room wouldn t reccomend this hotel no positive my room was on a floor where there were repairs being carried out the corridor was in such a mess that i would ve preferred to have had a room on another floor the service and staff efficiency bar and restaurant are always good at this hotel in my experience no negative check in was quick and efficient concierge was helpful and took our cases for us as we arrived early at the hotel and could not check in until later checking out was also easy and the receptionist booked us a taxi to take us back to train station which arrived promptly hotel was a great location for olympia where we were attending the olympia horse show room spacious and comfortable and breakfast was lovely sink and bath didn t drain properly and the shower guard on the bath wasn t fitted correctly so the bathroom floor flooded when you took a shower air conditioning didn t work room was really hot but the streets were too noisy to have the window open at night reception staff were amazing so friendly and helpful faulty bathroom door that staff had no urgency to fix what seemed like v un organised staff working on checkin desks as queues were v long upon arrival and check out asked for a bathmat sat am never turned up and we checked out sun so another delay when i made the booking it was for a special occasion for my wife our her best friends  th i asked for a bunch of flowers upon arrival or balloons etc to make it more memorable and i didnt mind paying for the extras upon arrival unfortunately this never happened if i would of been advised that this is something you would not do i could of arranged something myself and got there earlier to arrange value for money the only thing was no soap in the bathroom i was taken by surprise by the style and choice of bars seating areas and activities for children apple macs grill staff who were slow and didn t understand basic english reception staff were excellent and charming room was simple but functional and very comfortable breakfast was     which i thought was a bit steep room was a bit small for a superior room only thing that made it any different to a normal room was a mini fridge with   bottles of water in it located right next to a tube station which was great to get in and out of the city centre about   mins on the tube bed was very comfortable staff were extremely helpful the hotel lobby and bar restaurant area were extremely hot it would be more comfortable in a cooler atmosphere we have used this hotel twice now and both times need to queue a fair time to book in at reception the room was a good size clean good tv internet the breakfast waitresses were helpful and friendly the breakfast was lovely with a very good choice of items in one of the rooms there was a smell of sick coming from the drain in the bathroom very unpleasent a very bright and modern hotel staff in bar area were very pleasent and friendley i would stay here again way too warm thermostat useless took ages to check in despite repeatedly telling the girl that we had my brother s wedding in   mins and were running late comfortable bed i ordered a taxi for the morning but the guy in the reception forgot to book the driver was waiting for more than   minutes the room size and the bathroom we travelled with three teenage children and three adults on a special trip to olympia all booked separately via booking com my friend booked on the same day as us and got a much better deal including breakfast     we had to pay   per night we were staying two nights and the hotel wanted to charge     each for breakfast which for a buffet style meal and in particular for a child is ridiculous we were not in a position to pay this amount of money and were left with our children being split from their friends at breakfast time i did mention it to the reception and they offered us a coffee as compensation which falls far short of what i think they should offer why are novotel offering such extreme rate differences we used the restaurant on a separate occasion the previous night we opted for the restaurant and quite honestly the food was appalling the location and cleanliness the hotel was good room very warm couldn t open windows very much air con did not cool room nice rooms comfy nice staff good facilities quick check in and out good baggage facilities great location for olympia staff were rude and not very informative had to ask where and when breakfast was booked as supposed to be   star room basic and carpet all marked and stained only   teabags in room advised taxi to olympia when could have walked and would have been quicker was just a short walk from olympia which is were we were visiting able to leave bags pre and post check in had a bit of trouble with our room and rather than come up to our room with the solution they made me go to reception even though i told them i had walking difficulties the rooms were comfortable and clean breakfast was very good difficult to find reception and would have preferred a larger fridge efficient helpful staff marvellous beds the most comfortable we have ever stayed in the breakfast tea was not very hot asked for a second pot which was just as bad some of the items like bacon were cooked to a crisp location was perfect for the eventim apollo and west london didn t like the pillows strange shape that did not provide a comfortable position for the neck a modern hotel with lovely facilities excellent bathroom comfortable mattress very clean excellent staff fantastic breakfast and splendid buffet dinner not really a dislike but the breakfast was fairly ordinary and not particularly good value for money ideal location for hammersmith apollo and tube stations clean room good bed and linen quick check in service in bar terrible waited  mins in queue asked to sit at table for table service waited another  mins gave up close to venue light and spacious we thought the carpets were dull grubby looking in the corridors rooms very peaceful quiet for such a busy london location excellent breakfast with something for everyone public areas were beautiful the young foreign receptionist was hard work and couldn t understand how i had booked   rooms each for two adults in my name but our friends would occupy the second room but didn t share our surname the hotel was clean warm and modern the superior rooms well equipped and comfortable not enough instant coffee in the room only for two cups per day would be nice to have a cup in the morning and a cup in the afternoon no soap dish the sink is very nice but there is no place to put the soap close to the tube excellent bed breakfast hours are great until noon on weekends most things once you passed the lobby it was a different hotel tired dark hallways with cracked broken ceiling tiles preceded a room which was sad and dark shower knobs were missing pieces light switches covered in grime a window that looked directly into another guest room window hot sticky air pumped into the room and overall cheap furniture and finishings it s not an expensive hotel but you can get so much more for your money elsewhere the lobby seemed recently refurbished laud fan in the room because of blowing wind outside thin walls so you could hear doors open ect and we even had a big stain on the sheet but im sure it had been washed so i didnt complane but for   pounds good location nice beds very good location for conserts at apollo theatre and rest of london close to the tube great with a hairdryer both in bathroom and bedroom bedrooms are small and not compfy even after complaining and being moved to another room it was no better very shabby reception was modern well lit and clearly recently refurbished stingy with basic necessities no bath mat provided cheap toilet roll extremely small amount of shower gel staff were extremely friendly and helpful modern and clean hotelno negative excellent location for what we required courteous staff and clean comfortable room not a complaint but the hotel overall is very hot and quite stifling good breakfast and service the poor choice of foods on the bar menu the state of repair of the toilets on the  nd floor the stingy towels and toiletries in the bedrooms the public spaces and the professionalism of the reception staff horrible room service we had to wait over an hour for food and when it finally arrived my burger was burned and my husband s noodles cold nice room but wifi extremely weak no video on skype possible rooms are rather old too bad for such a known hotel network executive room has a view at least whereas twin rooms overview the roof safe was broken no reparation done within   days stay water the sink is not going away wouldn t like to stay there again nice view good food overall a nice place to stay if you need olympia exhibition hall two nites of torture no a c only blows hot air we complained and was promised by micha to have room with working a c but after long day was given worse room blowing hot air we were put up in nicer room  th floor but no a c had to open window to noise light then either to hot or cold i m sick now from lack of sleep thanks novotel never stay with you again facility breakfast ok i usually stay at the novotel blackfriars which shames this hotel rooms are dated and standards are more like an ibis than a novotel personally i ve stayed in better premier inns no positive the room was really small and the worst was the heating in that bedroom completly awfull more than   all night even if you were putting the thermostat at   we were there for the olympia show the staff are really nice not enough shower gel shampoo slightly pricy but expected in london very friendly staff lovely hotel great location and views had prepaid so no need to check out at desk which was handy carpet badly stained shower running hot and cold not constant temperature pillows quite weird always only one dressing gown in cupboard when couple are using the room public area near lifts certainly on  th floor need a lick of paint location is good for the apollo so easy to see bands etc that bottled water is provided foc coffee pod although would like less decaf and more proper full fat coffee pods the bath shower looked a bit tired and the room was very warm we couldn t get the room cooler without opening the window which then made it quite loud due to general london traffic the room size was good very comfy and clean and staff very friendly great location for the apollo and links for getting into central london guests with dogs using the main elevator totally inappropriate staff saw it and did nothing about it bathrooms needs attention not so clean noise coming from the corridor was very laud breakfast is   which is a completely ripoff comfortable bed and very near tube station entrance not on the main road road to main entrance is poorly lit good size room iron provided in the room was useful hard bed suits me maybe not others good flexible workspace quick room service good breakfast for the price liked the fact it was   mins walk to both local tube station and the office i was woken up by workmen drilling new locks into doors along my corridor first thing in the am huge hotel v run of the mill rooms better value for money at a premier inn the breakfast was pretty poor for     nice bar air con in room didnt work so room was too warm in november car park was offered at over   discount which sounded good until we were billed at   per day that is normal for centralish london but they tried to convince me they charge   for non residents so we had got a cracking deal hmm location and convenience to get in and out of london legendary full english buffet breakfast as we were walking from fulham it was difficult to locate and poor signage we had to walk through the bus park and shopping centre to find the entrance welcoming and comfortable and clean great facilities in the room comfortable bed cleaner didn t knock on the door before entering at    am when check out is mid day no apology received when reported to check out staff good location comfortable room lift from car park to reception area is woefully small and slow car park charges for hotel residents are very high room could do with a refresh carpet dirty walls need repainting staff very welcoming and helpful breakfast was good and plentiful even at the busiest times didn t like that had to pay for car park thought it should be included i liked the close proximity of the olympia the underground car park and the shop onsite no bad experience as such but the room   where i stayed at the end of my trip there appeared to be some sort of fizzing noise coming from one of the sockets close to the bed forgot to mention it in my hurry to catch a train the location was great and the staff fairly friendly and welcoming long wait to register only   staff on general desks very busy reception area need a quick access desk for pre booked guests the quietness facilities and comfort of the room were great not really a bad experience but did feel the artisan grill was somewhat overpriced although the food was very nice waited ages to be served at the bar in the evening we liked the overall experience of our stay in a comfortable clean hotel excellent friendly staff well situated for the hammersmith apollo and underground station carpet was absolutely filthy dirty and badly stained did not want to take my shoes off shower broke complained x  never was fixed smell of sewage when using bathroom tap disgusting no positive registration on arrival was a shambles no order nobody knew where the queue was we complained and were taken to a desk ahead of other confused people we had pre paid and this was not a good start to our stay proximity to my appointment location heard a lot of sirens i am aware that this can t be controlled by the hotel staff but it was the only thing that ruined the stay slightly by being woken up early also it would be useful to have more plug sockets the bed was comfy and i have no complaints about the cleanliness of the room the wifi worked perfectly very odd experience had to ask housekeeping for more tea bags only   in room was immediately quizzed as to what time i was checking out explained check out was  pm so would be gone before then but was pushed to give an exact time to the lady whilst i totally appreciate she has a job to do please let me enjoy my stay first check in was fantastic lovely gentleman deigo couldn t have been more helpful or friendly warm welcome which we loved best reception we ve had on the   occasions we ve used this hotel worth noting all staff are extremely pleasant helpful shout out to bar manager his crew always really nice breakfast as always was top notch room are always fresh good comfy i didn t like the cost of the carpark even at the reduced rate i appreciate this is standard for london but even so excellent breakfast although i wouldn t pay     for it we got it as a package the best soundproofed windows i have ever seen comfy and large bed the let down of the hotel was the lack of staff at reception the whole of the weekend we were there there were only two desks manned and there was constantly a queue of guests waiting the staff throughout the hotel were very helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble we were allocated a room on arrival which was not suitable but the lady on reception was so accommodating in finding us another room really quickly so that we could enjoy our weekend visit booking in out was a little slow but seemed to be rectified when queues developed comfortable clean room good breakfast in a good position for access in the area no negative lovely modern hotel all staff were friendly and helpful bar prices were a little steep but was expected in london breakfast was nice lots of choice and our room was nice bed comfy and a good size would stay here again hotel was too hot it made it slightly uncomfortable to sleep excellent hotel staff was very friendly we never had to wait more than a minute to be served food was fantastic we would definatly go back again no negative hotel room was really nice we had an executive room with a massive bed which was very comfortable food in the restaurant was very nice just a little expensive no negative rooms were very spacious and clean get to breakfast early otherwise the queue can be long although plenty of good hot food do ask for fresh coffee though as have a habit of letting it stew on the hot plates we checked in dog tired after  pm hoping to go straight into our room but the room was just about to be cleaned we lugged our cases down to the lobby and did not enter our room till around  pm no positive carpet stained with blood drops flagged to reception but obviously ignored by housekeeping reception immediately offered another room despite booking com stating   room safe   pay per view channels neither were available good location ok bar restaurant good gym the room old smelly no fresh air dark no hand soap ac didnt work so room constantly warm not a very enjoyable stay the rest of the hotel was modern and clean but unfortunately i had to sleep in the horrible room gym terrible beds really bad back ache never had in a hotel before insane prices in restaurant which why restaurant empty all the time totally stupid unacceptable waste of prime space even staff agree it is ludicrous charge for car park come on great position for london excellent staff the parking it is ridiculous it says parking avaliable chargers may apply definately aplly and at     an hour absolute joke i paid   to basically sleep there and paid   for parking if i knew this i wouldn t have booked it and find this very dishonest the hotel was nice but the bar staff absolutely terrible the male staff member shouted at us on two separate occasions as well as other customers he should not be working there the young girl turned the tv off when we were watching it in the bar and refused to put it back on lifting tables over ours and people s heads we had no choice but to leave  pm the location and the grill room had great food rooms were basically furnished and tired looking bed linen had holes in it free wifi was intermittent and often ineffective helpful staff at reception and the bar had requested a high level floor but got room on level   first level for rooms typical basic hotel room although paid for a superior room had asked at reception for a good room but the view from the room was a flat roof between buildings at    pm on saturday in fairly empty lounge ordered a blt took nearly   hour to arrive cold waitress without apology said the kitchen had been busy but no one was ordering food except us the hotel has   restaurants one buffet but closed on saturday night limited cosmetics in bathroom no conditioner or shower cap only one night but had we stayed longer would have requested to be moved to a better located room on the way to heathrow airport breakfast frozen bread and cold food told one member of staff and they only said they would let someone know saturday night was in bar for drinks lady bar manager was not very nice to other guest told them to go to bed or leave if they were not staying in hotel no way to treat guest dinner good nice bar the staff at breakfast picking up plates and other things from the table before we had finished eating the bar was worse very uncomfortable staff walking around all the time asking could they get us another drink when we hadnt finished the   we had we didnt get a chance to relax carpet in bar was in nead of hovering tv in room didnt work had to wait for ages to get through to reception girl overcharged for food had a big problem geting it sorted the location being interruppted by staff   times from    am when we weren t checking out until   noon room too hot engineer called still hot next morning although payment cleared on departure pre authorisation payment took   days to be removed from my account leaving me without any funds for the week disgusting and unprofessional i would expect a full refund to be honest so disappointed on what was suppose to be a special occassion for me no positive asked for extra milk and coffee for our room did t get it why water in the drinks fridge not needed location to hammersmith eventium and tube station excellent choice at breakfast the room was very hot and the a c did pretty much nothing we had to open the window which unfortunately meant we had quite a lot of road noise excellent staff serena who checked us in was very friendly and professional nothin the level of service was excellent compared to similar hotel chains very comfortable room and very good breakfast good location for accessing london via the tube it s a disgrace that you charge   for an overnight stay and that you have to pay     per hour to hotel guests for parking     to park for a night stay absolutely disgraceful and not even a breakfast for the price i won t be using novotel again location hammersmith apollo i didn t like the fact you had to pay for parking it added an extra   on to our bill which was   already for one night with no breakfast i think if you are paying for a room in the hotel the parking should be free or a standard rate of     per night the breakfast was     per person which i though lt was really expensive so we went to weatherspoons which was only a   minute walk and was really nice the hotel was nice i do think it was quite expensive for what you got though i liked the fact you had free wifi a gym and there was a couple of restaurants to choose from and i would visit the hotel again not a bad experience but we had an awful job working out how to get from the tube station to the hotel because the bus station and barriers were in the way it was very confusing we also thought breakfast was too expensive nice welcome at reception treated like individuals rather than just another customer lovely clean and comfortable room that was not too small not cheap but would recommend no negative i stay there while my husband is in hospital and the staff have always been so wonderful to me and there is nowhere else i would rather be i have never know such friendly and helpful staff the room was minimal vsv aesthetics compared with many similarly starred and priced hotels in the usa and europe breakfast was absurdly expensive i ate out or brought food from outside difficult to locate at first the room is large and has all features the staff was helpful the room quiet comfortable near the hammersmith station and its shopping facilities in the room everything worked well the cost of parking   to park from     on a friday until     on the saturday has to be factored into the cost of this hotel if visiting london with a carno positive the price of the parking very expensive they should just park a smaller set amount per   hours disappointing especially when it is free to park outside on a sunday the hotel was lovely and easy to find great rooms with no noise safe and bath plug did not work parking very expensive     hr but it is london good size room quiet room staff changed our room without any question when they could not fix the safe for us no negative staff were charming which makes a difference in a big hotel like this great location for my purpose novotel hammersmith was spotless lot of facilities i probably could have used if staying longer than   night lifts quick and efficient plenty of them considering it was busy and i was on  th floor air con in room was good not too noisy like some places i have stayed and easy to operate the bed was very comfortable and   pillows were provided   which were a great design with pivotal fold in centre en suite was spotless and towels were larger than some places free bottles of avian still water were provided in mini fridge as well as lockable mini safe attitude of some of the staff particularly in the bar and when we went for breakfast they were very rude also breakfast does not finish until     by     there was hardly any bread no ham and by     no croissants quite poor if you want continental breakfast the restaurant was excellent and service extremely good the restaurant was very pricey and only decent quality food the beds were not super comfortable but average power outage occurred during our stay which was inconvenient and somewhat scary overall the hotel was expensive hotel was in a location that was convenient to the hammersmith tube stop hotel desk staff was really great friendly helpful and informative for a european hotel the rooms were considerably modern large and comfortable toilet seat on floor hairs in bath and a sink which didn t drain i ordered tea with my breakfast and despite chasing it didn t arrive hopeless no positive executive rooms  th floor don t have a bath their website made it look like all rooms did have one and when being at the end of a hall there s no wifi connection possible mind that during my first two stays here i did have a perfect wifi connection comphy bed upgraded to executive room with nespresso machine etc for only     nights quiet room clean   free waters in the fridge tho no refill and close to hammersmith station shops and starbucks olympia is in walking distance too signage to car park not brilliant background music in reception was very annoying tea and coffee facilities in bedroom were a bit mean comprehensive breakfast efficient restaurant staff lovely bedroom the air condion is not working in cool mode you have to open the window to get cool air the room i got is not as per the reservationno positive the roof terrace few tables and chairs no garden short walk from tube station to hotel very convenient for queens club easy walking distance away the only issue was the slowness of check in they need more staff on the front desk a great hotel we were upgraded to executive rooms no negative my daughter had exam at     near the hotel and the staff arranged for a late checkout very helpful as it was a saturday no negative efficient service bit of an issue with the  st room as it was not tidy but immediately a better room was given it was actionec quickly wouldn t say the executive room was very executive at all if i m honest good location and overall a nice place to stay there was some mold in the bathroom staff were extremely helpful and let us check in early and the hotel is in a great location mattress was rock hard horrible smell coming from sink ice machine on my floor broken all weekend dispite reporting it   times helpful staff i asked for an invoice at the check out the lady very kindly told me that it would be sent by email but i haven t received it yet no positive check in and the hotel was very busy it was a very good stay just a little problem checking in names mixed up noise from traffic through the night big beds each nice bathroom and added bonus of a fridge in the room and a superb breakfastno negative good service from arrival to departure very nice breakfast fantastic view from my room public transport to central london very close this was supposed to be a superior room but it was very basic and i definitely wouldn t say it was superiorno positive had to pay for breakfast for   year old son as we had it in our room had we been to dining room then it would have been free location to olympia expensive parking if staying overnight and we re not able to leave the car park due to exsit card info missing good location bathroom quite run down very slippery bath hardly any working channels on tv wifi went on and off local to events and shopsno negative i liked the hotel was so close to the tube station and it was close to central london the bus links were very good not enough staff behind the bar very pleasant staff but there needed to be more staff behind the bar everything else was great not enough bar staff in the evening therefore service very slow they did their best though clean well maintained hotel and helpful staff no negative the room was fantastic considering the price we paid the staff were all super friendly we will definitely be staying there again no negative i always book this hotel for family coming over it s a few stops to the west end and   stop on the tube to westfield shopping centreno negative i got a free upgrade and the service at the hotel was brilliant all the staff were really friendly would definitely use this hotel again nothing everything was fantastic i loved the exciting room it had all the lovely touches you expect from a good room to bed slippers etc very run down room with a rock solid bed the lighting is extremely depressing nice reception area and generally clean very quiet room no negative there is security issue at the hotel since there is no doorman at the hotel entrance so anyone can get into the hotel easily house keeping is bad don t provide shampoo and body wash i have to call house keeping every night when i get back to my room no positiveno negative we were chose as guests of the day and given a free room upgrade and breakfast also the bed and pillows were very comfy there was nothing i disliked about my stay food and service was excellent also everything most of alll the comfort of beds and pillows no negative the breakfast was delicious and the staff made us feel very welcome the room was clean spacious and had everything we could need no negative smooth check in clean room excellent facilities cracking breakfast lovely staff can t fault it perfect for a gig at hammersmith apollo room was cold and took a while to work out how the aircon radiator worked to heat the room room is comfortable and very quiet a few problems with room wear and tear having to log onto wifi again every   hours location excellent no noise between rooms free wifi gym you really must put a mirror underneath the tv set women need to do their hair and makeup without standing at the long mirror no positive considering novotel standards worldwide novotel london was no match at all while i was expecting world wide standards location and decent room size the reception area was messy and dirty as well as the toilets we reported this to the reception desk it they were not interestedno positiveno negative close to transport and plenty of great shops for shopping near by plenty of choices of bars or restaurants to eat at with good meals and prices no negative very friendly staff upgraded our room on arrival and oferred free breakfast excellent location if you want to see a show in eventim apollo volume of tv was hard to control only went up to   and i am hard to hearing so it wasn t too pleasantno positive the corridor carpet is dirty and all the maintenance doorways could do with repainting did not give a good first impression the room was excellent your site siad it included breakfast i screen grabbed it but no breakfast big discussion and i got charged no pool room tired location ok very pricey upon arrival was upgraded to executive room from standard room as i was apparently guest of the day very nice surprise no negative only there for one night as we were attending a concert at the eventim apollo which was a few minutes walk from the hotel lovely stay with friends room felt a bit basic and slightly dated location car park is really easy being underneath the hotel gym is a proper gym for the price this hotel is kind of drab the facilities are limited during the stay the ac didn t work so well no positive don t get a room opposite the cleaners room if you don t want to be woken too early clean bed comfortable excellent choice of breakfast no negative the hotel was fantastic all the staff were so polite myself and my partner had a lovely time staying at the hotelno negative we love this hotel we love the rooms location and enjoy being able to use the gym facilities in the morning nothing comes to mind a no fuss business hotel good location for my business related work awesome breakfast buffet warm and welcoming staff a bit of noise from the corridor otherwise a quiet room good size room nice and clean excellent breakfast great choice and great food the hotel is hidden from view if you don t know where exactly it is the staff in every area of the hotel were amazing that some staff didn t know what a scottish pound note was which is annoying in   location for me and comfort and staff were helpful the mattress was a bit hard for me the location was good and even though the hotel was huge the reception felt friendly and accessible haven t had my emailed invoice yet for the size of hotel and the number of guests that must have been staying breakfast was excellent the weather but dont think you can do anything about this haha the location was perfect staff polite and you had everything we needed to hand bed was to soft it was like sleeping on a trampoline will need a firmer mattress if i stay again convenient location for purpose of visit i had to ask for extra sugar in the room there was only   small packets for   people the bed was super comfy we loved the pillows if they made it slightly cheaper so we can afford if more often the bed was extremely comfortable we didn t want to leave once considered ordering room service didn t because i thought the   tray charge was excessive great location comfy beds and great service no hook on back of bathroom door to hang robes or toiletry bags no shelf by mirror for combs and clips whilst drying hair proximity to venue the noise from other people in the room next door and the slamming of the doors staff were friendly beds were comfortable and clean there was a mix up with our breakfast we were only showing   for breakfast when   of us checked in staff very polite though no positiveno negative efficient and friendly staff lovely comfortable clean room all the paths upto the hotel had even been salted as it was very cold not enough bar staff had to stand for about   minutes in a queue to get a drink after attending a concert no positive plug sockets faulty only one worked breakfast was not hot only warm room key stopped working for some reason needed to go to lobby to sort it out no positiveno negative the reception staff were very friendly and helpful at check in and check out rooms good size for london and lovely and clean could have been a bit cleaner and more personable great location for main purpose of visit staff approached for assistance were friendly and helpfulno negative close to apollo we were going to a concert there clean good value for money tube station near by for easy access into central london the lock on my door was broken i had to move room the carpet in the first room was filthy the second was fine locationno negative the staff were all very friendly and polite the facilities and restaurants were good and the room was very comfortable and clean room was very warm but this was a minor negative staff were friendly and very helpful room was clean and comfortable breakfast was superb breakfast is very expensive if not included in the room cost very friendly staff great facilities lovely rooms and very close to the tube dirty floor in the dining room i was chosen as the guest of the day diego was great on the welcome desk my room was very comfortable and clean used room service trays in corridors for all of our stay   days and extortionate parking charges breakfast and friendliness of reception staff the hotel is tucked away means it is quite quiet but difficult to find the entrance well located for underground and easy link to central london so far nothing the reception clerks we very helpful and accomodating the location is quiet and very proximate to the heart of the city had to queue for   minutes to check in and   minutes to check out the room was good with a comfortable bed and a great shower had to change rooms as booked executive room and had mouldy walls and ceiling as well as a hole in one of the walls not impressed no positive shower was a bit weak thats all very comfortable and spacious beds also liked the fact there was an ice machine at hand in hallway the room was to hot air con didn t work carpets are dirty the bed was really comfy location was great right next to eventim apollo reception was on first floor perhaps i am not used to it location of the hotel was near the tube station it had a good wifino negative friendly staff cleanliness of room and everywhere else quietness was a welcome surprise given the amount of rooms in the hotel no cupboards therefore needed to live out of suitcases poor shower screen so water over floor after shower was a nuisance to clean upno positiveno negative comfort and location although the hotel is large it was very quiet the hotel was very busy but the staff were very efficient room size and toilet size is very small the bed sheet was not clean all in all it is not a clean hotel the staffs were helpful nothing the staff were excellent the location is spot on in theatre district the rooms were lovely the air con died in the unusually hot day in london so they moved us to another room and offered refreshments as compensation the best we will return hopefully the evening service in brummus the hotel restaurant was lacklustre compared to the excellent service at breakfast the following morning fabulous bed and linen the haymarket is the cleanest hotel i have stayed in staff are lovely decor exuberant and fun the breakfast is very good indeed for such a central location it feels very tranquil nothing everything was amazing words cannot express the amazingness that is this hotel from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out the service has been by far the best i have ever received at a hotel the room was beautiful bathroom is gorgeous the hotel is just breathtaking my husband and i were set to elope in the city but due to the rain they let us use the library for our vows and let us take professional pictures around the hotel they treated us like royalty and we cannot wait to return i can t think of anything the hotel found out it was my  th birthday and they upgraded our room we met our friends for cocktails in the brumus bar which had a good range of cocktails they even arranged fantastic weather all blue sky the pool was too cold even for the children and they said they could not turn it up which is such a shame and explains why it is not used the staff in restaurant were abrasive and slow with poor english food and reception and rooms were fabulous check in information we were not provided information of serving times for breakfast where it was served or check out time a very minor issue beautiful decor and lovely touches with free gifts on tv no german news programs swimming pool not enough heated and around the pool no possibility to lay after swimming on a deck chair or a lie there are only normal chairs and   sofas before the bar on breakfast grilled toast often black burnt but for all that not more hot beautiful and very comfortable room on breakfast very good croissants fruits are very aromatic in optimal maturityno negative wonderful hotel i would highly recommend beautiful well appointed rooms fantastic staff and facilities fantastic location and food thanks for a great stay i could have stayed longer everything this is my favourite london hotel with incredibly comfortable rooms staff that do everything to make your stay enjoyable and breakfasts that are varied and always enjoyable i thought the breakfast could have done with some work we had room service and that was fine the timing was excellent but there could have been a little more attention to detail the staff were attentive and thoughtful they were happy to answer questions and print off our theatre tickets etc a very pleasant stay with the thoughtful little touches you d expect turning down the sheets in the evening giving a fragrance to the room my wife loved very good it would have been nice to include tea coffee making facilities in the room and a pen or two along with the letter writing things rather than a pencil when we stayed in the covent garden hotel we were all given a free scented candle a few more treats and trimmings for the price of the room would have been nice though we had a really good stay very comfy bed and lovely room excellent shower and breakfast very friendly and helpful staff and room service was quick we loved the decor and the relaxed atmosphere and we were in such a good location for theatre going and restaurants having to leave and not being able to stay longer this hotel is worth the money the room and the decor of the whole hotel is wonderful having been designed by kit kemp with an eclectic mix of items and furnishings which work so well together we ate at the brumus restaurant and enjoyed excellent ambience service and food breakfast was served here as well and again was excellently presented with good service the location is great being convenient for theatre land and areas such as china town and soho not all staff on front desk were attentive lady was really nice younger man told us to take a seat whilst he checked our room was ready and then forgot about us hotel and room were nice and good location because the room was so lovely and offered a comfy sitting area it would have been a plus to have had tea coffee making facilities this is not a complaint however the whole experience for our special wedding anniversary was amazing a bottle of champagne on our arrival this is the place to visit for luxury without stuffiness food in the restaurant was sublime and the breakfasts offered a huge choice from very healthy to full english the staff were amazing the room super comfy and even though we live only   minutes away will be using this gorgeous establishment often bed pillows not firm enough for me delicious breakfast great lounging area really comfortable bed excellent shower really helpful pleasant staff all extras needed in room the lounge area in bedroom could have been a little larger excellent breakfast a special mention to all the members of reception inc concierge they were fantasticno negative the beds are exquisite food exemplary and staff exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times of the day they even sorted a little secret room decor for my other half s birthday which included helium balloons and champagne they went above and beyond to keep the our upgrade secret too wonderful trip nothing could have been improved upon the staff were very attentive the facilities were superb the decor and cleanliness were excellent the location perfect the only criticism of the hotels is that you are unable to make a cup of coffee or tea and must always use room service it isn t a problem for a one night stay but for longer it becomes a nuisance and also expensive firmdale hotels always feel so welcoming and comfortable nothing is too much trouble eg printing out tickets i did mention this to the management on my departure regarding the unacceptable noise that emanated from the room above from about   pm onwards to well after     it sounded as if a group of acrobates were practicing their act running and jumping one evening i rang up reception to the unacceptable noise from the above floor they had no explanation of the of what was happening it occurred every evening that i stayed at the hotel breakfast were really delicious with an excellent choice of temping offers loved the spacious well appointed room smell of drains in the bathroom when emptying the bath only one roll of toilet paper which meant we used tissues until the room was serviced then they gave us two only tiny things though didn t really matter all of the staff esp reception and bar people paul and a lovely soanish lady we didn t catch her name also the lovely concierge staff who parked and returned our car and packed it so carefully for us location was excellent loved the furnishings and the laid back feel if the place us not stopping long enough on arrival my newly wed wife and i were upgraded to a better room the room was excellent and a nice surprise awaited us an ice cold bottle of preseco and gorgeous strawberries with white chocolate the staff were all amazing thank you for making our stay memorable it would be nice if the hotel could put up a more noticeable sign that we could see from the main road it wasn t fun for an   year old lady to have to walk back and forth just to find the entrance also personally if the swimming pool isn t so functional please don t advertise about it to me it was like you re cheating the customers to have a proper pool you need to have a proper changing room with a shower for both sexes guests should not be expected to change in the toilet we liked the location right in the heart of everything whether it s trafalgar square national gallery soho or piccadilly the cleanliness space of the room it was really big with big very comfortable beds the breakfast good the staff polite helpful my   year old mother especially liked the little services in the room e g the personal welcoming note the   pm tradition that the maid had to come to recheck the room get the bed ready for her sleep the interior ground floor was wonderfully designed to show a blend of the old world and the avant garde the library was cozy and fitting for a nice reading time had to leave soon location hotel decor room decor and cleanliness bathroom breakfast swimming pool everything is comfortable and makes you want to stay longer will definitely stay again that we couldn t stay longer the bath was so relaxing and having the television in the bathroom meant to didn t have to watch the cricket we enjoyed a wide selection of drinks in the bar and spent the following morning in the swimming pool which warmed up once we d been in a few minutes the staff were lovely and we felt spoilt from the moment we walked through the doors drinks were slow in arriving at dinner because the bar was very busy wine arrived after we had finished our main course so     of a bottle was left behind the beds were extra comfy staff were very helpful and friendly everywhere was spotlessly clean checkout wasn t good i found the lady that dealt with me was discourteous and abrupt also the location wasn t as ideal for us as i thought it would be lovely comfy bed and quiet bedroom lack of tea coffee making facilities also the bath took an incredibly long time to fill the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the products in the mini bar only downside of an otherwise perfect stay was a slightly snooty member of staff in the bar but that was it and it didn t spoil the stay lovely hotel very comfortable quiet room everything i needed and breakfast was excellent it would have been nice if tea and coffee making facilities had been provided we were brought cups and saucers and fresh milk and were offered a kettle we had brought our own but it would have been better to have had these already in the room with sachets of coffee and tea bags we were confused by the organisation at breakfast it seems we should have waited for our order for cooked dishes to be taken before we served ourselves from the buffet but this was not explained to us when we were shown to our table we had a large newly refurbished room which had been elegantly decorated the bathroom was very large and spotlessly clean when we returned from an evening out the towels we had used had been replaced and the bins emptied our pre theatre dinner was good with excellent service from our waiter who completely understood that we had only limited time nothing central location friendly and helpful staff great restaurant with excellent breakfast all areas are beautifully decorated the rooms a bright spacey and clean bathrooms are perfect good pool and gym facilities free high speed wifi all in all a great base to enjoy london literally nothing it is perfect everything about this hotel was top notch the hotel is perfectly located near key attractions but not too in the middle of the tourist mess the rooms are elegant and well appointed with luxurious modern amenities the staff is attentive as suits the level a luxury hotel demands they went over the top in every aspect while it is not for budget travelers the value of the hotel is well beyond what it costs i will never stay anywhere else flexible reading lights in the room would have been an improvement the pricing structure for breakfast is rather complicated delightful smiling staff high standard of decoration and furnishings very welcoming and comfortable convenient location what s not to like did not like the fact that when we arrived on friday and checked out on the monday morning at    am that we could not use the lovely swimming pool area we purposely booked this hotel because it had a swimming pool there was a private function on there on saturday sunday very disappointing hotel is a fantastic location literally within a few mins walking distance to everything very helpful staff extremely comfortable beds and the suites were excellent no coffee making facilities in the room becoming increasingly common in hotels these days absolutely one of the best rooms ive stayed in gorgeous and clean renovation works being carried out in the room above very noisy had to ring and complain as it sounded like they were about to knock through into our room they stopped the work this was the afternoon we checked in however the next morning we could hear people going in and out of the room from    am no in room tea or coffee facilities which is a shame as we didn t want to have to call down just for a cup of tea loved the location of the hotel great sized bathroom and bedroom very clean and bright upon arrival we were told the pool gym spa area were closed for a private party not good enough at all you advertised a significant feature which you then failed to let us have benefit from the room location beautiful lounges bar no negative stunning stunning stunning hotel decor was room decor even swimming pool decor was beautifully designed excellent and professional staff attention to detail handwritten welcome note chocolates and gorgeous smelling kit kemp bathroom goodies the light levels in the room were not really adequate for reading a book the newspaper in the evening we find this is a problem common to most hotels what is required is a standard lamp behind the settee easy chairs however it is rare to find a room with one the assumption seems to be that guests look at a computer or watch the tv rather than read the staff the location and having a quiet room no bad experiences friendly helpful efficient staff especially the bar restaurant workers the bellmen all went out of their way to make one feel relaxed welcome we were not told in advance to going out for the evening that the bars were closed that evening for a private party so we went out for dinner and when we came back to have a drink in the bar we were told we could only go back to our room for a drink which was very disappointing if we had been warned of this we could of planned to stay out later loved the style of the hotel and personnel touches pool area was lovely and had   great massages the gym was impressive and mini bar was great no negative the staff were extremely helpful and friendly very accommodating for us being out at unsociable hours and holding our luggage whilst we were out after check out pool was to die for but changing room not well signed and temperature of water was cool cold perhaps bracing best adjective the friendly staff breakfast and afternoon tea were excellent very attentive without making you feel uncomfortable our shower had clogged drain of water so i think the room shouldn t be sold bed mattress was a little hard location reception noticed that during the stay i had my birthday and i got a little cake sweet nothing we thoroughly enjoyed our stay the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful and our room was very nice the bed the most comfortable we have had in all the hotels we have stayed in there is also every facility you may need we would most definitely stay here again location also excellent no negative we felt so well looked after there are only   rooms so you feel like you have the run of the place and the staff couldn t do enough to help we had a late saturday night dinner in the brumus restaurant which was also excellent the location is perfect very close to the theatres restaurants and bars but just tucked away in a quiet side street fantastic experience we have already booked again for december nothing the hotel was excellent in every way and the service was second to none we particularly enjoyed the breakfast and the pool the location of the hotel could not be better no negative this is my fifth time staying at this hotel it is my home away from home excellent service with central location but still quiet and and oasis of peace love everything about it swimming pool should be heated instead of air conditioned spa gym area would have been nicer with sauna very friendly personnel very nicely furnished decorated all new and perfectly finished outstanding location internet connection was extremely fast the price but you pay for what you get and it was worth every penny everything service was excellent as was the food within brumus just small notice regarding the in room dining to increase the menu options excellent hotel a true five star hotel we enjoyed the stay the way the glass light shook with the elephants that didn t much sleep in the room above quirky pool great staff amazing food wi fi so so in fact  g mobile bandwidth and reliability much better than the wi fi superb rooms staff service food ambience loved everything the staff here were excellent and efficient i had my suit pressed within   minutes and the room service was fantastic loved everything about it we have stayed at many lovely hotels but this would have to be the best we have ever stayed at no negative the interior design of the hotel is beautiful as are all the firmdale hotels really makes a stay special breakfast was also first class we were in a part of the hotel with no lift and the dvd player is the room didn t work properlyno positiveno negative the location which was across the road from her majesty s theatre where we were to see phantom of the opera being over charged and them telling me i wasn t telling the truth then rang my bank and they said   different payments have been taken out one for the room rate   and then an extra   then suddenly they said it s come up on there system saying they charged me twice and all they could off what   of what a joke very disappointedno positive prices did seem a bit high a kitkat from the mini bar at     seemed rather excessive the whole experience was fab and would certainly want to stay again the staff inparticular were informative and very friendly small issue with some staff having very poor english check in sent us to the wrong room trip back to reception but very helpful and resolved quickly food and drink is very expensive in the hotel but there are options for cheaper eating next door at the o  if hotel not in your price range brilliant location right next to   view from standard double fantastic breakfast expensive but prepaid and was really worth it very high quality and plenty to choose from room was well insulated and quiet even though in flight path for city airport room and bed super comfortable very clean staff were very helpful this was an anniversary special night away and was really worth it we deliberately went on a night no concert on at the   spa pool lovely and included in room price highly recommend and we will save up to go again next year the direction indicator to the o  was not clear it would have been better on the door leading to the venue rather than on the garage notice which made it look as if the entrance was through the garage the staff were very caring and did everything to please they remembered our preferences for food and were always friendly and polite and made us feel wanted we ordered tea in the morning and was disappointed with the operation of it we asked for a large pot with at least   servings we only got   cup and saucer lucky there was a mug in the room but we just managed to squeeze out   cups of tea all for   the room was amazing we were given an upgrade so it was a real treat the view from the windows was lovely we decided to stay in the hotel restaurant to eat before going into the o  for a concert again that was an excellent choice the food was lovely i would certainly stay there again if i had a concert to go to loved all of it this is the best hotel we ve ever stayed at staff were friendly and so very helpful the hotel was clean the bedrooms beautiful the bathroom huge highly recommended bit out of the way but only short tube ride to central london very very comfy bed marvellous bathroom spotlessly clean perfect location for o  arena the room for the price paid was small to have a king size bed i use intercontinental hotel for my leisure and business travels a lot in the us thought i would get a similar sized room excellent layout of the room and the bathroom facilities size maybe the bathroom lighting could have been better but nothing could really detract from how great this hotel is our room was beautiful with an amazing nighttime view across the river  th floor staff were friendly and helpful and the location was absolutely perfect for the o    member of staff up in the  th floor bar very rude made me and my lovely wife feel like we were not good enough to be there so spoilt our  th wedding anniversary treat after a great day and night before hand fantastic for   the views of knight outstanding i always usually need a twin room and even though i books a twin i am never down for a twin when i arrive maybe i am doing something wrong i was upgraded to a suite this time which was fabulous the whole set up is quality and i stay here every time i go to a concert at the   breakfast excellent i have stayed in other     star hotels in london and paid more but this was the best i have seen excellent selection and beautifuly presentedno negative we found the hotel to be modern and well maintained we were upgrade to a suite and the room was of a really good size the view from the room was wonderful as we had the o  on one side and canary wharf on the other the views from the   bar are amazing at night so well worth a visit the room service menu was not great there was not much for people who eat halal i suggest that there should be more on the halal and vegetarian options also more standard foods e g more options for burgers etc loved the room it was very clean the breakfast was great and better than most hotels in london     for the breakfast the broadband connection wasn t too good the room was fantastic very modern and very neat and clean it had everything you would need for an hotel no negative a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff excellent facilities and flawless service the room was incredibly well equipped and maintained to nothing less than an immaculate standard i will certainly be staying here again the restaurant staff were lovely but the service was incredibly slow and some of the food was cold even though the restaurant wasn t at all busy they were very apologetic excellent location for the o  arena gorgeous hotel the walking path between n greenwich tube station and the hotel was not the safest and i would not feel comfortable walking alone there in the dark as no one would be around to hear or help if something bad were to happen it is also not straightforward to get to the excel or landmarks it was very quiet and the breakfast was very nice it was also close to the o  for non hotel food options the concierge was very friendly and professional and gave a very warm welcome to our hotel staff were extremely good i was there with my   year daughter on my own travelling from ireland to the celine dion concert the staff were very good to her aisling the only things i can comment on are the coffee maker in the room didn t seem to work even though i got power to it not certain why swimming pool was too busy on the sunday morning when i went down to try it but i guess its because it is popular  am vidas the concierge had his first day back at work after returning home he was very helpful in attending to hiding a cake with the cafe patisserie staff olga and her team for it to be presented to my son on the terrace later on additionally the requests i asked for when i made the booking with booking com were attended to by the hotel ie a room with a river view and other thoughtfulness made my son s  th birthday a memorable one nuria checked us into the room very attentively my wife thought the tea served on the g f terrace was exceptional quality the champagne in the sky bar we had later on was very good bar was ordinary for a hotel of this calibre waited ages to be served to be charged crazy price for glass on wine   pound each after waiting   mins in line to be served hotel tried to fix but too little too late huge room slow service in the bar on floor   but the staff did try there hardest to accomodate our requests beautiful bathroom really comfy bed views over the thames drinks in both bars with magnificent views great breakfast service at the bar late evening not the best no initial acknowledgement and slow service could be improved the bed and sofa bed in the suite were excellent very comfortable bathrooms stunning reception staff concierge and doormen were superb spa treatments were booked up so we wasn t able to receive any treatments also the mini fridge in our room was locked so we was unable to put drinks we brought from outside inside the fridge the bed was really comfortable facilities was great location was perfect enjoyed our weekend spa treatments and food in the restaurant were a little pricey but to be expected since it s in a nice area of london and a very nice hotel did want to book the treatments but had a busy weekend planned may have booked it if i stayed for another night loved the sky bar and the buffet breakfast incredible views from room and around the hotel had an early check in and late check out staff were very accommodating spa facilitates were also great too it was a shame the bar upstairs wasn t open in the afternoon this hotel is amazing friendly staff comfortable and beautiful rooms amazing view prefect location no negative this hotel is amazing one of if not the best hotel i have ever stayed in the rooms are immaculate the facilities are top notch the breakfast is delicious and the staff cannot do enough for you i would love to stay in this hotel whenever i visit london thought the mini bar prices were very expensive only stayed for one night so can only rate the room as didn t use any of the facilities thought it was lovely and the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in also the pillows were so comfortable that i had a look at the make of them and am going to order some for ourselves being old fashioned i like written information on the hotel in the room would have liked to know in advance how to work the lights and times the pool opened the best thing was the friendliness of the staff and willingness to help the pool in the spa was clean and pleasant staff let this hotel down was given no information at all upon check in for facilities bars restaurants etc we was told we could order pizza at rooftop bar but then staff up ther said no we couldnt we waited   hour just for some chicken skewers when only hand full of ppl in ther beautiful clean hotel lovely pool nothing we loved everything friendly helpful staff lovely clean and comfortable hotel our bedroom was also clean and comfortable with a good view of the river thames and the o  arena breakfast was very good with a large selection to choose from only a very short walk to the o  arena being next door to it and with it s own walk way as well you re there in only a few minutes we really enjoyed staying here and will definitely stay here again in the future when going to an event at the arena found the parking prices a little misleading and a misleading quote on wine tray charge think it almost shows that its misleading so you don t realise your being charged which is a shame like making sure you read the small print very boldly says free valet parking then further down car parking payable at about   per day but for a not seasoned traveller i just read free parking maybe have the price and free valet parking in the same section the wine in the room that is outside of the fridge you could wonder if it was a small free bottle of wine the business card with it shows something free but when reading properly its free tray charge should you want a different bottle of wine beds were so comfortable room cleanliness needs a little attention but nothing to be too concerned about i don t like smudges on glass and mirrors also more importantly bar staff need to be trained on how to serve clients in order of arrival room view and comfy beds gbp   per person for sunday brunch rooms overall a bit pricey even for london unattractive long walk from north greenwich tube station nearby shops and restaurants cater to the o  crowd not in keeping with the quality of the hotel these remarks concern the general ambience of the neighbourhood not of course the responsibility of the hotel itself room and bathroom clean and with luxury fittings and furnishings floor to ceiling windows good blackout curtains large comfortable bed quiet extremely friendly and helpful staff no negative everything was just perfect my doughter and i were seeing take that at the o  so it made sense to use this accommodation as previously we stayed at accommodation a little further away definately stay here again just to add we even had a room upgrade with lovely views of the river honestly i think everything was good sorry can t help you in that i like everything the food the locaci n but the kindness and consideration of the personal with my one year old daughter was very nice thank you so much price hike a truly excellent hotel and a wonderful place to stay with great facilities but the hotel had quite clearly hiked up the prices for the event which i was attending across the river at the excel not happy with that at all price of drink in the bars bit pricey loved everything about this hotel complete luxury at great price staff very helpful excellent customer service skills facilities amazing pool and spa deserve  star plus conference centre again had all you needed to continue a working schedule if required the only minor fault would be the service in the eighteen sky bar took a little while to get our drinks too staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived the view from our room was incredible we were attending a concert and this was the ideal hotel for location when leaving the next day we were unsure how to get back to the station we cannot fault how helpful graham was with advising us to make the river bus he showed us on the map where to get off and was just generally a very nice helpful man thankyou for our amazing stay x breakfast area could have been more luxurious it was a bit over busy and stressful not a very calm atmosphere the scrambled eggs were to die for at breakfast the convenience for   was totally incredibleno negative this was a very modern and high tech hotel very comfortable bed and easy access to greenwich and london as well the staff restaurants and bars were excellent nothing the eggs benedict was amazing shane in reception hes irish and he was exceptionally nice he was so professional patient and a joy to meet a big thank you to him for making us feel so welcome and making our stay so nice brid   elaines therese julie and kateno negative the staff here were most attentive and friendly the room was very clean as was the bathroom toiletries bathing robes and slippers were provided also tea and coffee making facilities breakfast was substantial with a selection of cereals fresh fruits hot foods cold meats and cheeses as well as a selection of breads and pastries there was also a selection of fruit juices as well as tea and coffee the towels were a little rough they need softening or newer towels the bed was so unbelievably comfortable and there was so much choice for breakfast the hotel also did a lovely job on a surprise for my partner s birthday i was hosting a very small confidential meeting in my room and i ordered a tray of tea coffee to be delivered to the room i received a tray of coffee sachets and tea bags no extra cup beds were so comfortable and the pillows excellent air conditioning and heating was easy to operate and responsive views from the room were fantastic staff were lovely and courteous from the maintenance men to restaurant bar staff concierge receptionist and doormen first room had no view but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the  th floor with a fabulous view bed was amazingly comfy and staff were great lack of information sat nav did not have address tried to call for directions phone rang and rang gave up found that signage to hotel very poor poor signage into hotel from car park staff several times gaave us the wrong information such as quickest direction to tube que at check in and departure with empty desks room and breakfast breakfast was bit pricey as it s a one off price it was lovely great view over the river easy to get to tube will try more facilities next time check in was a little slow however i think it was just down to timing it was a little disappointing that the lobby bar with the external seating area closed at  pm it was a beautiful evening and having just attended a concert at the o  it would have been nice to enjoy a drink outside check in staff very friendly lovely room we were upgraded to a suite as our room was not ready great location for the o  service in the coffee lounge near reception we ordered scones with cream and jam we waited for almost   minutes and when they arrived they were inedible they had clearly been warmed through in a microwave and were of a bready texture when we mentioned this to the member of staff he just said sorry they are made upstairs i really resented paying   for a terrible product which does not represent the hotel very well great location of concert at o  room card did not work so had to go back to reception mini bar was locked although had paid on credit card for extras complimentary bottles of water were not there bed comfortable waited nearly   hours to get the room we booked should have been able to check in when we arrived as we arrived    pm broken ironing board had to be reported twice before it was replaced my daughter put a comment on twitter about the service the manager rang us at    pm the next day as we were climbing into bed after a busy day offered an apology and fruit which turned out to be   apple   banana and some grapes which we refused then a member of the hotel staff gave us a nice little wake up call at     am said hello mr hillier and put the phone down so was done deliberately very comfy bed and pillows very clean if it hadn t been for poor customer service we would have enjoyed the stay no negative it was very luxurious the staff were really friendly and the door man made you feel very special would definitely recommend it it was great location too and easy to get into london by underground service charges in bar and prices for breakfast were a little steep considering how many restaurants do breakfast in the o  lovely hotel booked to attend a concert at the o  which would have been ideal had the concert not been rescheduled got a non refundable rate so couldn t cancel hotel is lovely rooms are nice and clean with a huge bed travel in and out of the city was easy and would definitely recommend if your attending the o  booked for a concert at the o  but the concert got cancelled and there was no way of cancelling without full payment for the room they offered to move the room to the rescheduled concert date but i can t attend on that date and wasn t offered anything else so ended up staying here if you aren t visiting the o  it s somewhat isolated from london if you are then it s perfect no positive didn t find the food child teenage friendly and a little bit over priced excellent location if you are attending the o  venue for a concert or event paying for parking after you pay a good price for the room as a guest you think it would be free as it s there car park all was so perfect staff friendly they went out there way to help it would have been useful to have been given at check in or provided in our room more information about the hotel overall such as the spa restaurant s and bar s it was a shame as we later learnt after wondering around aimlessly that the hotel had brilliant facilities but non of this information was supplied to us at all during our stay we had to discover this for ourselves poor for a hotel of this size and hierarchy could not fault our room in fact we didn t want to get out of bed in the morning the bed was so comfy and the bathroom was divine wonderful shower and separate bath with built in bose sound system which was a delight no negative very friendly staff every member of staff i came across went out of their way to greet you no matter what they were doing room was amazing views from the sky bar at night are brilliant sky bar was very busy no seats available at around  am so we stood at the bar but as soon as a seat was available we weren t forgotten by the staff i could not fault this hotel in anyway just two capsules of coffee two others were decaff and having used those at    pm i d have expected them to be replaced so we had some for the evening morning but no would also have expected a hotel like this to change the towels in the evening too especially with temperatures in the  s no fresh towels no turn down service receptionist a lovely portuguese girl was extremely charming and helpful everything was smart fresh and clean the breakfast price but it was still nice the room was lovely facilities were good easy to the tube to travel around london the views were good and the staff were really helpful and nice car park floor was filthy rough concrete and dust although being in a wheelchair noticed it more but more like a building site there are ten disabled spaces and everyone was taken by sports cars and chelsea tractors not one of them had blue badges displayed i had to park at other end of hotel with bags by time i got to check in was rotten not a good start and paying   to park is why i mentioned it location quality helpfulness and sky bar could ve done with some instructions re electronics in room but worked it out eventually staff were so friendly and attentive great customer service overall excelent service but the only thing was when we were having our breakfast the staff kept trying to clearthe plates when we had nt finished eating it happened a few times the beds was so comfy great nights sleep the bathroom luxurious brilliant views the staff was so helpful nothing was too much troubleno negative it was the ideal location for going to the celine dion show easy access to o  arena and close to city airport great staff friendly and excellent service room wonderfully comfortable with excellent views enjoyed every minute no complaints the staff are very friendly and very helpful from checking in to checking out we really enjoyed our stay here with the arena so close you realise how lucky you are to be staying here no opening windows or balconies needs adding to their room description most things were more than excellent especially the staff who were brilliant no negatives we were delighted with the hotel it was exceptionally clean friendly all the staff were very friendly and helpful mario gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an upgraded room he explained everything clearly we stayed there to go to a concert at the   and it couldn t have been easier it made life so much easier to walk through the walkway straight into the   and afterwards while everyone else were rushing to catch trains etc we ambled back to our room and the view from the front over to canary wharf was wonderful and we had a side view of the dome it was a delight we had a wonderful breakfast they had everything there you could want and nothing was too much trouble could of had a bit more variety of food our room was amazing especially with the river view the spa was great and the staff were very welcoming couldn t of picked anywhere better to spend my weekend that i couldn t stay more days the staff was extra polite the acomodations were very comfortable and exceeded our expectations very clean hotel with a bar at the upper floor the car park charges perfect location for our needs as we were visiting to attend the   arena for a concert we were given an upgrade upon arrival and the two floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing outlook onto the river the breakfast was good enough staff very friendly the car parking charge was far too expensive for my liking but we had no choice everything was so good loveley staff everyone was willing to help the doorman was a true gentleman and simone from the reception was a wonderful guy i ll return definitely it was so clean especially for london area wonderful view overal just a     price but totally worth it absolutely stunning hotel would love to stay there everytime we come to london but very expensive sky bar beautiful outlook but drinks super expensive nothing not to like staff location facilities brilliant breakfast my grandson s first london visit and concert we will remember our stay and concert forever very expensive mini bar friendly staff made us feel right at home everything was clean smart lovely rooms very comfortable classy great access to the o  with no queuing top notch no negative we booked a room as we were attending a concert at the o  the hotel is right next door to the o  and has it s own entrance into the o  building the staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful the room was great and the view from the window was very cool well worth the money as avoided packed public transport before and after the show can t wait to stay there again constructive comment not a complaint would have liked more than one breakfast tea bag as no tea pot provided more milk and a some biscuits would have been good staying to see a concert at the   arena later meal snack availability would be nice in the bar after performance room was lovely and quiet great to be able to set the room temperature bed very comfortable air con too hot where broken in the bar but too cold in the downstairs bar where it was working best location for the o  lovely bar on the top floor with great views unfortunately the air con had broken so was a little hot for our visit comfy beds i unfortunately left my heated brush behind but when i rang up in the afternoon they said that the room had been cleaned but nothing had been found the bed was really comfy and i really liked the duvet bed linen was visibly old tatty in places bar service as opposed to table service in the sky bar on sunday night then closing at     far too early for a   star london hotel excellent choices for breakfast telephoned housekeeping and asked for ice as we had champagne i was asked if small or large bucket and was told it would be sent up to our room asap one hour later it hadn t arrived so i rang again and was told it would be sent up after possibly another hour or so and we rang again the lady we spoke to who said she was from housekeeping was extremely rude denied the request had been made and that was that we never got the ice nor any other contact from housekeeping not the treatment you would expect from this standard and priced hotel shame that this let them down breakfast river view from bedroom bar and restaurant location to   arena bedroom and bathroom there are certain things i would expect from a   star hotel for example i did not find in the room a hair dryer and neither a toilet brush probably i could have asked for them but i expected them to be already available in the room the distance between the sink faucet and the bottom of the sink was also really small and the tea and coffee facilities could be better for example i only had decaf coffee in the room and no afternoon tea again i am sure i could have asked for them and i would have received them but this is something i expect to be available without asking in a   star hotel however i was really pleased by the kettle and by the brand of tea s as well as by the coffee making facility a   star hotel that offers almost everything a traveller might expect the bed was comfortable the room was nice the reception staff was always ready to help ideal for attending a concert at the o  as it has a direct connection to the arena and that is awesome no negative the room was very comfortable spacious and well equipped the staff at check in and out were really friendly and through we stayed to see a concert at the   and although we had to pay extra for the hotel parking it was still really convenient it was a special treat but would do the same again if the opportunity arises prices in the clipper bar ridiculous fabulous cuisine and service for dinner in the peninsula restaurant extremely comprehensive delicious breakfast buffet private entrance to the o  arena a big plus the room had a strange smell in it when we first arrived but this soon seemed to disappear one of the bar men in the sky bar was a little strange we loved the welcome that we received at the door and on reception we loved the room and the bathroom the spa was fantastic and the bar on the  th floor is amazing the walkway to the o  is a real bonus too the views from this hotel are outstanding floor to ceiling windows in the toilets so cool breakfast was absolutely amazing so much choice no negative the hotel was ideal for the concert at the o  as we only had a short walk to the venue hotel reception was was a pleasant experience and mario who checked us in was very welcoming room had a great view gym and pool were excellent the best overnight stay we ever had and we will be returning in july the staf from the moment we got to the door reception and catering staff the closenes to the   after recent avents didnt want to travel home after a concert cocktails very expensive nearly   service charge to bring them to you table in the sky lounge which is unecessary amazing place to stay very friendly staff amazing views from sky lounge availability of spa treatments no availability at all over the weekend very disappointing service in the clipper bar left a lot to be desired it was slow lots of staff who seemed to be dashing around whilst achieving very little a number of disgruntled guest at the bar the bed was very comfy breakfast was amazingno negative was not expecting such a large room for the price we paid the room was amazing and views were excellent the location was superb and prevented extra long ques to get in to the o  we will be booking again very soon no negative best hotel i have stayed at when visiting the o  for location and accessibility the entrance to the o  is via a short walkway next to the reception no queuing to get in if i had to complain about anything it was that there was not enough tea bags milk or bottled water although i had a room on my own my daughter s were sharing but there was only   still   fizzy bottle i think for the price i paid there should have been a bottle each i did mention about the tea bags milk when i was checking out but forgot to say about the water we were also charged for water at the table when we had dinner something else i forgot to mention but we didn t know that we had been charged until i got the bill the hotel was the best that i have ever stayed in the reason i booked it was because it was near enough attached to the o  myself my two daughter s     yrs old went to see take that although this was our sixth time of seeing them it was still exciting to see them the show once again was fantastic after it was just a short walk to our hotel fab u lou s no negative the room was spotless and beds and pillows megga comfy like being on a cloud the bathroom was amazing with beautiful products to use we had a swim in the lovely spotless pool the staff were lovely and so very helpful nothing was too much trouble all in all we loved our one night stay and want to go back the only thing that we could make a critisism of and it is minor is the swimming pool could be a few degrees warmer no one was swimming in it at all we loved everything from the minute we got out of our taxi on arrival to the minute we got back in a taxi on departure the hotel is amazing perfect for the o  the staff were superb and made us feel that we welcome at every available chance so much so we are booking to stay again at the end of the month no negative the hotel is brilliant for getting to the o  as it is literally a   minute walk away it is also very well signposted i am so pleased with this hotel i cannot fault it was informed at reception that we had been upgraded to a river view in which we had already booked and paid for one already the hotel is ideally located for a night at the o  i wouldn t normally pay that much for a hotel but the location and comfort was second to none lack of attention from staff in downstairs restaurant when we arrived who didn t notice our food had not been served them served it cold half an hour later at least no greeting or explanation or menu given at breakfast breakfast was amazing fresh and tasty service and food were good for the evening meal and effort was made to right the earlier problems the room service menu is very expensive and a mini fridge would be a great addition to the room the staff views location and food where all fantastic bar eighteen is well worth a visit one of the best bars i ve been to the breakfast was amazing will definitely be staying here again lack of clarity about room type we paid extra for a river view but initial allocation had poor view room was changed to a much better one but staff mentioned upgrades several time but as far as i know that is what we paid for booking com booking was vague about this too the so called discretionary service fee of     was not always appropriate but we did not want to make a fuss perfect location quiet helpful and friendly staff nothing to fault fabulous hotel highly recommended staff were extremely helpful upon check in a fantastic view when entering the room on to the o  arena peaceful night sleep pillows were very comfortable breakfast was exceptional no faults will definitely be returning would have been good to have a meal in he hotel after the concert at the o  but it closed orders at     so we had room service which was very prompt the queue at the sky bar was long even though the staff were flat out and made sure what they served was what you expected we love the bedding we want some soft light quilt the room was lovely and so clean and up to scratch we could just walk into the o  no hassle it was great the heating was a little issue  c we had the heating on but it took a little too long for us to feel the heat the bed was a     ultimate comfort spacious room lovely view very professional staff nothing all top notch amazing location brilliant reception staff were professional friendly and cheerful throughout customer service was exceptional and the room and views were stunning bar drinks and breakfast along with the views were all   star we chose our room by the picture we saw on booking com which was a lovely big specious deluxe riverside room when we arrived for the check in expecting that room we thought we paid for they said because we booked through booking com they can t guarantee the same room which was a shame because when we did walk in the room they did gave us it was small comparing to the one they advertised lovely stay at the o  intercontinental hotel for my birthday we had lunch at bob bob ricard and gaucho at the o  for dinner lovely to be offered a glass of champagne by the hotel for our dinner at gaucho nothing to fault it was all good the views are outstanding on  th floor cannot fault the intercontinental great experience perfect location for the o  had a problem with the sound on tv only came from the bathroom was offered to change room by the technician but was too late at night for us to do it as we were tired really friendly and accomodatig bar staff visited the sky bar which i thought was a little over priced and not as welcoming as rest of hotel staff beautiful hotel in great location used the swimming pool which was lovely found all the staff very pleasant room was very clean and modern great selection at breakfast steam room wasn t working on the first day we absolutely loved it it is the best holiday we have stayed in in the uk it was great in terms of the pleasantness of the staff the staff bent over to accommodate all of our needs they were polite and friendly the price for breakfast is a bit expensive so we went without for a bit cheaper we could travel elsewhere and enjoy something else the staff were extremely welcoming complimentary upgrade on the room was a lovely bonus the bed was extremely comfortable it is a lovely hotel but very expensive for   night reception staff were so helpful they were amazing trying to help my husband get an early check in as he had been travelling over   hours and was shattered brilliant all staff friendly and helpful bar opening hours limited to    pm so missed out on a drink up high with a view the breakfast was so enjoyable all the usual expectations but extra touches such as individual smoothies home made yoghurt pots plus a lovely setting with views over the thames the shower on our room   was not great only part of the shower head worked and large amount of the holes were blocked great choice at breakfast ease of access to the arena nothing great hotel if going to the o  like us for a concert concert to room in under five minutes very helpful staff good rooms and a great sky bar to visit in the evening slow service in clipper bar and service charge added to an order for   lattes which ended up costing     not worth the money lovely comfy bed great location close to tube and the walkway to the o  was great staff all very friendly room very clean and quiet nothing the staff were fabulous very courteous and helpful always very cheery and making one feel at ease the rooms were very comfortable and the bars restaurants were all top quality the walkway to the o  was a brilliant addition if going there for a concert i could not find fault with anything at this hotel i had to wait a long time to check in the person who checked me in looked like she really did not want to be there very unfriendly and did not engage with me at all or make me feel welcome the bar service in the evening was also very slow and we did not get all of the drinks we ordered the location and the facilities nothing the room was amazing but it was the staff on the door and at reception that made all the difference very friendly happy and the hotel itself is magnificent not getting loyalty points on my membership as booked through booking com breakfast was expensive at   each so gave it a miss the bedroom was spacious and comfortable particularly impressed with the bathroom that had a good sized bath and separate shower cubicle my daughter wanted to take home the pillows and duvet as she said it was so comfortable room had a good view out over the thames it was good to have the dedicated route into the o  which definitely saved time drinks prices are pretty harsh but we were in a luxury hotel in london fantastic hotel for concerts at the o  only a short walk in car parking is easy and we got a discounted rate of   per night which though expensive is better that   nothing to improve excellent in every way possible greeted on arrival straight to check in one minor hiccup as we booked two rooms sorted out quickly excellent rooms with all amenities you could wish for view over thames o  check out just handed over key card everyone so polite only positive experiences it was amazing to go to the hotel after a full day of chaos at the heathrow airport and our flight to sa being cancelled we were tired and had no baggage with us the hotel staff were very sympathetic to our situation and assisted us in every way they could provided us with dental kits and even plasters for the blisters there is nothing not to like everything amazing the  th floor sky bar is a must for anyone staying at the hotel the room the staff the facilities everything this hotel is amazing contact lenses from previous person still on bedside table but easily missed my poached eggs were nasty no spa treatment for young teenager not even nail varnish felt spoilt and well looked after comfortable happy stay someone available all day and night lovely staff breakfast in bed luxury hotel staff service in bars was very very slow accommodation is overpriced given location paying to park at location is not suitable view was great room was nice n a staff very friendly and polite swimming pool and spa were amazing and i had the best ever pimms cocktail made for me overall would definetly recommend and i would book again in a instance no negative the beds are amazing so comfy breakfast was amazing the rooms where very very nice and the staff were extremely nice helpful and professional definitely going back we had not a single negative vibe i am sure i rated this experience previously however to reiterate my partner amanda and i found the intercontinental   truly wonderful we chose the option of club lounge access and although we did not have the time to take full advantage of its tremendous facilities on our next visit we certainly will the spa was superb the big bonus for us was the staff were par excellence nothing was to much trouble thank you once again and we very much look forward to our next visit tom madden just very expensive considering the location you cannot get a better location if you are visiting the   especially loved the private entrance straight into the arena only available for vhotel guests the hotel is simply beuatiful stunning my gosh it s extraordinarily expensive its more than some west end hotels with not the same attractions however we loved that kids ate free if you are staying in the hotel and their rooftop bar was breathtaking bedrooms were soo comfortable and with modern technology with their tvs and air conditioning it was a definately luxury if you want to treat yourself then stay here but value for money it is not it s for sure expensive but beauricular the staff could not be more welcoming and gave my son a little welcome gift as we arrived when i win lottery i will be back again nothing room was lovely over looking river bed was one of the most comfortable i have slept in i visited with my daughter and she loved the bath and the shower was amazing staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was to much trouble my daughter and i were attending a concert it was lovely that the hotel had a corridor to the o  arena so we arrived at the concert relaxed and refreshed when the concert had ended we didn t have to worry about rushing to get out check out was easy would definitely visit again and recommended to others that we didn t get told that parking was   on check out if said at front desk as we stayed at hotel we ended up paying   loved everything about hotel facility s comfort views and staff but we weren t told about parking charged different prices for same drinks was told it would be lookedible into and someone wouldale phone us but never heard a thing sent email as left phone charger in room again never heard a thing lovely rooms friendly staff have nothing negative to say everything from the moment we arrived to the moment we left wonderful friendly staff luxurious stay in a very clean room with a fantastic view     discretionary service isn t discretionary it is automatically added to every transaction attentive staff fabulous breakfasts superb location rooms spacious very clean bars uncrowded lively views of london in the eighteen sky bar none of the restaurants were available for us on the day as there was a corporate event going on that took over the restaurants there was a bar serving snacks but we had planned a nice   course meal we had looked at the menu for the restaurant online and decided to have a late lunch early dinner before the evening show we were advised that we could have room service but a nice three course meal is not so nice of your laps in the bedroom great hotel in a great location we went to the o  in the evening and this hotel is right next door modern feel and very clean that i didn t stay for longer the room was amazing the staff are very helpful and the views from the sky bar are phenomenal especially at night we stayed following a concert at the o  and the distance to walk is negligible it is clearly sign posted and there is even a special exit to from the hotel o  for guests of the hotel which made it that little bit easier it has really set the bar high i m not sure there is a better hotel in the country the drinks were a little bit expensive staff were amazing and the facilities were so good food was very tasty overall an amazing stay and would definitely go back we felt the breakfast was not worth the high price room was very comfy and modern one of the nicest bathrooms of any hotel i ve seen staff were very helpful and courteous the location in relation to the o  was perfect i guess i was expecting more from a  star i wouldn t say the room was any better than a travelodge as we were going to see a concert at the o  the location was ideal staff were very helpful leaving and come back to reality wonderful a really beautiful and lovely hotel the employees are very kind the room was marvelous and quiet this hotel was just amazing the breakfast is a perfect combination for all tastes with great product definitely hope to come back quickly we attended a concert at the o  and after we wanted to go to the sky bar we were unable to go to it earlier as it was closed for a private function however due to the amount of people coming from the o  both residents and non residents we were turned away as it was at capacity whilst we understand this from a safety point of view we feel that hotel residents should get priority from those people who had just decided to walk across from the o  it was one of the hotel features that we were looking forward to experiencing very good staff room was a good size with a very comfortable bed clipper bar is a lovely place to sit and relax and again the staff were very good we had dinner in the brassiere restaurant and the food was good quality and again service was good we didn t know this until we checked in but the spa facilities are complementary so we would recommend using them bit over the top pricing in certain aspects one of the best hotels we ve stayed in staff are so attentive five star treatment all the way would definitely go back and certainly recommend cannot think of anything that could have been better sure it s a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so well worth it the beautiful facilities the room and the extremely helpful and friendly staff the proximity to the o  cannot be beaten no negative the breakfast was the best i have had at a hotel the bed was very comfy usually don t like the pillows at hotel but these were very comfortable nothing excellent hotel great location and exceptional staff top quality accommodation would stay again superb value for money and ideal for access to the o  nothing could have been better the staff were attentive and extremely polite i had a poster from the concert i went to and when leaving luggage the next day i asked if my poster could be taken extra care of and the staff wrote that on the luggage tag it s the little things that make a big difference the rooms were beautiful and it was a perfect location for our use of the o  arena spotlessly clean and very luxurious no negative the whole experience here was wonderful the staff were so helpful and friendly the food was utterly delicious and the bed bedroom was the best we have ever experienced no negative the bed was insanely comfy didn t want to move from it the room view was incredible and the actual room was clean all the way from top to bottom great location for going to the o  amazing stay will definitely be going back there the bed it is not confortable at all mattress was very stiff and the pillows where a nightmare to sleep with amazing hotel especially if you need a place to stay after a concert in the o  very convenient facilities are amazing there is even a dedicated entrance to the o  from the hotel the price of the drinks in the bar the addition of the service charge on each order of table serviced drinks in the sky at not just once st the end location to the o  is excellent no complaints it s a great hotel and we will definitely come back bedroom was fabulous absolutely spotless and all brand new front of house staff were great hotel has a great location right next door to the o  dodgy phone reception window view was not good lighting system was unclear just amazing to relax in and comfortable a lot of facilities kind and polite staff ease of access ease of wifi use clean and polished the view could ve been better we were on the  rd floor and all we could see out of our window was air conditioning and some stairs thats it no view whatsoever but that wasn t an issue as such the room was perfect everything the hotel room and everything in it was   perfection what s not to like comfortable bed modern shower amazing views great food we stayed for one night and had dinner and breakfast i think i could live here the staff did not seem professional we had to ask for too many things that should be in place maybe a bit unorganised had expected more from a   to   star hotel excellent hotel with a lot of comfort the staff was nice and helpful very good food our check in was a little late and although sorted promptly when we went to check in at     after arriving at  pm and having a drink at the bar we were told our room was not yet ready once we spoke up about needing our room as we had plans to get out promptly we were then given rooms it would have just been more pleasant and efficient to sort that out before telling us that our rooms were not ready especially as they were aware we had arrived in good time and had been in the bar for an hour no positive free parking would of been nice but not a problem the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and comfy and a extra treat as they upgraded us for birthdayno negative overall the hotel was superb and the convenience for going to a concert at the o  arena was second to none would recommend unreservedly and definitely use again no negative reception staff very welcoming rooms are very clean and the beds are very comfortable short walk to the o  for a show we will definitely return if going to the o  again great selection at breakfast the only thing we didn t like is we had to pay ha ha easy and safe undercover parking excellent view of river thames from the room very relaxed atmosphere and made to feel welcome by the friendly staff bar prices are very high and the mini bar prices were ridiculous it would have been nice to have biscuits in the room to have with early morning tea coffee the size and layout of the room was good the proximity to the o  was the main reason we booked this hotel as we didn t want to travel after seeing a concert at the o  staff were very friendly and very efficient we ate in the market brasserie food was good but quite expensive if you don t have the set menu the service was excellent no negative the view over the thames and out to canary wharf at night was spectacular we also had the room service and both our meals were lovely and the service was excellent the friendly staff made this hotel no negative staff were extremely friendly and very helpful rooms were exceptional very clean and well stocked great view of the o  river we were there to see frankie valli at the o  and it was great to enjoy the short walk to the o  from the hotel for the concert would not hesitate to book this hotel again when we went for breakfast which was not cheap all the cooked food was cold so we could not eat it we were told by waiter to get some more but it also was cold we spoke to the restaurant manager and he just said you should have just got some but it was cold the point being that it should not have been cold in the first place and freshly cooked its a   star hotel and we expected better it ended our experience with you on a low we spoke to the customer liaison staff and they said they would look into it and get back to me but no reply from them on saying that the overall experience was amazing thank you the facilities was excellent staff were courteous and very helpful and very attentive the views from sky bar were amazing and a very pleasant place to unwind after a perfect concert in the o  overall a very pleasant experience didn t like sky bar never liked any of them at any hotels always feel like i shouldn t be in there and it s an elite club excellent hotel great staff beautiful room excellent facilities loved it absolute luxury couldn t fault anything on our visit made to feel very welcome staff made a fuss of my   year old daughter made her feel extra special will definitely return in the future nothing except it would have been nice to have at least a continental breakfast included in the price we paid for the room for both nights the room was so comfortable that we were happy to stay in on first night we arrived no negative the only let down was checking in we arrived after  pm and the queue to check in was out the door we had dinner reservations at  pm and we still did not have a room at     we just get being offered free drinks the sat nav in my new car qashqui would not accept the postcode off the web site there is a lack of signage to the hotel on the roundabout as you approach millennium way the cooked breakfast although there was a good selection of stuff was luke warm the room although equipped with a coffee maker only had two teabags and a couple of sachets of sugar about half teaspoon of white and brown we went up to the bar on the  th floor and had one drink each because the drinks were sooooo sooooo very very expensive the music in the bar was awful very repetitive boom boom trance music not at all relaxing or pleasant the beds were very nice and comfortable the staff were great the bathroom was great with a good powerful shower the room was nice and with plenty of space to move around the suitcases were brought up to the room for us and the car was valet parked you can easily walk to the o  but at the moment it is a noisy walk because of the building work i don t have any complaints about this hotel very comfortable bed extremely helpful staff having a morning swim and sauna was a great bonus plenty of choices at the breakfast buffet when we came out of the concert and went to the bar think it was  rd floor we had to wait   min to be served but the waiter was very apologetic it was fine but the wait was not acceptable really i still loved the stay but just a point to make staff were excellent and just complete quality cocktail lust in the eighteen sky bar was a bit limited but when i enquirer about other options available the bartender offered other alternatives e g a cosmopolitan corner room which had amazing views of the thames and the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept in i thought  pp for breakfast was much to expensive and so not value for money also no english breakfast tea in the room and when it was delivered it was not that nice the staff were amazing and the room facilities and bathroom were really nice only down side was the parking maybe my fault the hotel has its own car park upon entry to the   i did not see signs for the hotel car park and parked where guided which was a   minute walk to the hotel excellent hotel only used it for one night and breakfast which there was a fantastic choice of food and well presented the check in we should have checked in at  pm but our rooms weren t ready until    pm the beds were amazing graham on concierge made our stay at this hotel he was extremely helpful during our stay top bloke check in error meant we could not charge the evening food and drinks to the room but this was rectified after revisiting the front desk but was uncomfortable good size rooms and loved the walk in shower   hours to book in very bad complsined     hours for a mediocre two course meal complained breakfast   porridge   tea       tea i bowl fruit     serious rip off no positive i thought the shower was a bit poor mainly with the water pressure coming from it but that was the only thing we didn t like staff were very professional and polite yet still pleasantly down to earth the room was well laid out and spacious plenty of natural light and room to move about easily bed was very comfortable technology was really easy to use and worked well bars and restaurants were well staffed we were impressed by the ambience and design the mixologist cocktail barman in the  st floor bar lived up to his namesake the professor checkin took a while but they offered complimentary drinks whilst we waited staff were amazing rooms imaculate and spa facilities great rooms very quiet too perfect it s pricey but worth it if you want to feel like treating yourself great cocktails on   and lovely food on   no negative the room spacious with great river views the bed extra comfortable like floating on a cloud great access to the o  staff absolutely charming and efficient shower a tad small to get away from the water when washing your hair but really i m being very petty here the staff were amazing every single person we came across could not do more for us and it made our stay service in clipper bar could have been better we did not get nibbles like all others dining at the time waited a while to be served stunning view of the river thames from our room quick walk through to the o  the food was a little cold and the hot chocolate and coffee was cold they missed one bowl of cereal we stayed   night as we went to see bruno mars at the o  they allowed us to park in there car park and stay all day the next day as we was getting the underground into london and the parking only cost   if u pay at the machine it costs   also i liked the fact you can order room service     i do not know where to start with this   without being told we was nearly charged   for parking only for another guest to say to go back to the hotel and they will charge you   as you stayed the night no staff told us this   came back to the room late got into our very nice bed turned the tv on at    pm to find out none of the channels worked went to sleep woke up and they worked tv curfew   we paid for a breakfast included in the price got to the hotel no notice of this they wanted   per person for a full english as you can imagine left hungry   air condition in the room barely worked set to   degree as was warm in the room slept with no duvet on as air condition could not chill the room only itself   not all light switches worked had to get back out of bed to turn lights off buttons next to the bed did not work near   paid for the room and with lots of disappointments shall not be doing this again can pay for travel lodge holiday inn premier inn at half the price and expect more and to receive a breakfast with this room was nice and clean accommodated for needs for a night and beds were comfy the only improvement would be the length of time it took to get a drink in the bars needs to be reduced we loved the fact that we were so close to the o  as we were there to see bruno mars the hotel was great our room was fabulous and had fantastic views over canary wharf staff so friendly and helpful we will be back no negative the location comfort and staff make up for slightly higher than average price its also worth mentioning that it is well worth getting breakfast included as the quality and selection are first class there was not enough staff in the bar on the  th floor after the concert we attended at the o  i would have thought that they should have anticipated the requirement for extra staff considering there was a concert on at the arena the hotel is affiliated with the hotel was spotless the staff were very professional and the food was excellent there were different times for the use of the swimming pool so me and my   year old daughter could not go swimming together seems a bit ridiculous because children wouldn t want to go on their own no positive not long enough there second stay here and never disappoints staff are excellent rooms are fantastic comfortable beds and great selection for brekkie fabulous location for the o  the member of staff on the door to the sky bar she was a bit rude and made me feel awkward the view we were on floor   the bed the bathroom just everythingno negative from the minute we arrived the staff were so helpful polite and friendly we received an excellent service the hotel bars are relaxing with great views over the city i highly recommend this hotel nothing second visit to this hotel and again the service location staff were all excellent the rooms are well equipped and spotless the beds are so comfortable you just don t want to get up in the morning would recommend to anyone nothing love it great to watch the tall ships great to get away from busy london plenty of places to eat near by and convenient for the tube or bus even easy to walk to greenwich easy to get to   for a concert friendly staff the staff were very good the first two days topping up the tea and coffee however on the  rd night they didn t top up the earl grey peppermint and chocolate drinks these are the only drinks i drink as it s my last night i didn t make a fuss my husband drink coffee so it s no problem for him very near where i want to go room   in which we stayed was absolutely perfect and couldn t really fault it however maybe just a little mention for improvement both me and my partner loved the views you get from that particular room that we felt the room should have been the other way around more precisely the bed because we felt you could lay in bed and have fantastic views but from where the bed actually is you cannot see anything the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless nothing the politeness and friendliness of staff the location in comparison to our plans the cleanliness of the hotel and our room lovely and quiet professional staff drinks were a little on the expensive side my only complaint but the view from the  th floor bar made up for it stunning clean and classy bedroom breakfast buffet was fantastic beautiful lobby s greeted by very friendly staff can t wait to come back the o  was a stone throw away and north greenwich tube station is   minutes down the road the drinks at the bar were way to expensive we were planning to have a good few drinks at the bar until we got the first bill which was incredibly expensive which was a shame because we planned to hit the late night bar after the event but got discouraged because of the prices the room was very spacious and modern bed and pillows very comfy the hotel itself was excellent with a great location right next to the o  the value for money with the room service was the only downfall of my stay i felt that the food i ordered was extremely overpriced as i paid   for a chicken sandwich with fries but this was described as a chicken club on the menu this was the only negative i must say overall a very nice stay i loved the small details with my hotel room the speaker in the bathroom made my bath at night one to remember my view was perfect and i was very satisfied with the convience the location gave me rooms were very hot did not get twin beds as requested and they told us that we did not mention in booking although it was clear from the beginning and we did our booking   months ago but still they let part of the family in a double room that was not accepted and for the last two nights they made us shift to other rooms to get twin bed as well as for cooler room and still the rooms were too hot and then finally they realized that the filters of the air condition was not clean this annoyed us a lot will not come again location room size staff were friendly nice view from the roomno negative this is a lovely hotel the staff are really friendly and helpful it s very clean and the rooms are really comfortable we ve tested out a few different hotels to try to find one like this so we re so happy to have found it we d happily stay here again no negative perfect to stay at   arena it made the   day concert much more relaxing knowing we just had to roll out of bed and walk through the tunnel and we were there got told that the tunnel shut at  pm but each night it was still open around  am  am when the after party finished a little busy when the concerts are on however that was to be expected walking distance to the o  excellent modern hotel staff very helpful great view from the bar of london could do with some more outside areas to sit with a drink or eat on a warm evening excellent breakfast very clean room with comfortable bed friendly staff ideally located for the o  good parking facilities i wasn t able to connect to the tv using my personal phone youtube wasn t working having had the technician come at  midnight to operate the system youtube still wasn t working for reasons the technician did not understand either we were disappointed because we assumed the hotel had this service available for guests i ld strongly advise for this to be looked into for future visits bed wasn t extra comfy room temperature was adjustable the view from the room looking towards the thames was amazing the staff were highly professional and friendly the spa was great with good facilities no negative i loved everything about this hotel the breakfast was amazing the bed was really comfy the rooms were stunning and everything was really clean the staff were so friendly and helpful when we needed something nothing location with scenes over the river were fantastic and the panoramic view at night was beautiful looking over london all lit up hopefully you can produce a photograph that people can buy nothing the room size is magnificent with super size bathroom made it feel spacious and luxurious had everything we needed with very relaxed and friendly staff everywhere the maid coming in while we were out and taking the spare room key without informing us room was extremely comfortable perfect location surrounding very well kept with superb views the service at the clipper bar was very slow and latte was cold and never got the coke we ordered weren t made to feel very welcome the staff at eighteen bar were very friendly polite and helpful thought breakfast was a little over priced and although it is next to the   it is a long walk through the   to get to it from the ferry pier superb hotel in a good location for the   the staff were friendly all the time we stayed the room was spacious clean with a great view of the   and the thames the beds were big and comfortable great sized bathroom with a seperate bath and shower at breakfast there was plenty to choose from hot and cold food although it was very busy staff mangaged really well with serving and clearing up the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was a little like having someone using a road drill outside it did wake us in the night we mentioned it at checkout and they were most apologetic and said they would look into it very comfy beds with lovely duvets which were light but very cosy excellent selection at breakfast from continental meats and cheeses to pancakes cereals traditional english and plentyful selection of juices teas etc loved the easy and quick walkway into the o  we were back in our room  minutes after the concert finishedno negative everything is all i need to say have stayed there twice now and always has what i need great in that it has own entrance to the   and for the concerts its so good no negative overall the room was fantastic the bed was extremely big and very comfortable we enjoyed being able to connect our phones to the tv to play music the sky bar on the  th floor was beautiful and the cocktails were delicious we had a great view from our bedroom across london and enjoyed watching the sunrise in the morning no negative fantastic service great beds as soft as feathers wifi amazing bathroom spotlessly clean with great extra complimentary toiletries bath robes slippers etc coffee tea hot chocolate in room and a coffee maker great hotel very comfortable loved everything about it would definitely stay here again not enough coffee and milk in room but asked and emediately staff came with them beds were comfortable room and hotel very clean staff very helpful and polite pool and spa lovely breakfast very expensive we went to the nearby o  complex for breakfast instead tv control volume was either on loud or off no in between didn t report as not in the hotel much anyway very close to the o  arena and greenwich north tube station spacious room large bathroom my only niggle was the steam room in the spa was not working other than that it was excellent staff were exceptional i could not fault any aspect of their service there was a tassimo machine in the room and the coffee choice was excellent the only fault was more coffee should be supplied with the machine in the room the beds are amazing here the room view was awesome we overlooked the o  and the river bonus of a tassimo coffee machine and sound system in the bathroom there is even a private walkway to the o  from the hotel prices slightly above average but to be expected the place was perfect loved the bathroom and shower bed was super comfy room service pricy but what do you expect can t wait to return nothing absolutely fantastic hotel with brilliant staff customer service was excellent from the moment we arrived until the moment we left ideally placed for the o  drinks prices were quite scary sleek modern   star hotel with food service to match great views the perfect place to stay if you are visiting the o  we ran out of time what a wonderful experience we had at the intercontinental the staff were extremely welcoming friendly efficient in their job roles particularly shauna when we checked in and pedro in the clipper bar i booked this hotel as my husband and i were seeing a show at the o  for his birthday the staff at the hotel went above and beyond to make my husbands special day even better by giving us a lovely corner room with river view and a delicious cake and birthday message in the room for our arrival it was such a lovely touch and we really appreciated it the location of the hotel is perfect if you re going to the o  and really makes the experience extra special highly recommend it thanks intercontinental see you soon price was a little high very comfortable bed the squishiest i have ever slept in spa and pool fabulous close proximity  mins walk to the o  brilliant hotel no negative from the moment we walked through the door we were made to feel welcome a huge mention to the doorman concierge whose friendliness was heart warming and to sara who checked us in staff and customer care are what makes a hotel communication in bar could have been better re what wine would you like instead of being charged   pound for a class of large white wine i didn t even ask for a large one when i asked how much the bottle would have been was told   pound they did lower price to   pound for the glass room amazing spar excellent views stunning maybe increase gluten free offerings pastries for the breakfast one other small thing was that the tea coffee in the room while it was replenished it didn t follow a regular set up loved the spa stylish afternoon tea friendly staff great location would recommend for a touch of luxury the sky bar treat yourself to the view some champagne cocktails temperature in room was quite warm wasnt clear that you had to pay for parking on booking and at a cost of   a night i would expect free parking staff member didnt charge me when i raised this though great location for o  staff very helpful great pool i booked this hotel for the location of it as i was going to a concert in o  arena getting to the o  was a breeze from hotel perfect in fact but coming back the same way was a totally different story was told the fate would be open for return to hotel until     but as we rerurned from the concert at  pm it was locked so had to find another route to hotel so being   young ladies we asked the security well   security guards later and w  mins walking back and forward we managed to get to hotel but with very sore feet and a dampener on a great evening and great hotel stay staff whete magnificent and the views spectacular no room at the sky bar we were recommended by staff to go via email prior to arrival however it was so busy we couldn t even sit down so had to just go back to our room that was the only bar open so very disappointing large bed separate bath and shower i loved good views breakfast was amazing with views over canary wharf spa facilities were lovely being right next to the o  was great for us as we were seeing a show there lots of parking easier than getting the train quilt was extremely thick and heavy air conditioning only allowed us to go to minimum of   degrees room was consequently hot and stuffy which made it difficult to sleep faculties and room were stunning breakfast delicious location great for o  absolutely nothing what can i say this hotel was beyond amazing we had the most perfect view overlooking the o  arena bed was like sleeping in a cloud so comfortable staff was incredibly polite attentive couldn t want for anything more feel very lucky to stay i have stayed here thank you no negative absolutely wonderful hotel the staff were outstanding and the rooms were beautiful fantastic gym and spa facilities and breakfast was delicious we were attending an event at the   and there is a walkway from the hotel straight into the arena a perfect stay no negative the hotel itself is beautiful the room was gorgeous and the bed was so comfy staff were really helpful and even allowed us to check in early breakfast was outstanding with a huge variety fab location for us attending the o  with a walkway through the hotel directly into the o  would definitely stay here again the guarantee  gbp that i decided to let when i checked in was returned after   month and only after some phone calls great room very confy bed and the views from the skybar are uniq thank you intercontinental if you go to an event and it s gone  pm good luck getting food we came to watch the ufc and it was gone  pm and there was no food to get at all amazing how close you are next to the   arena the room are very big and the beds very comfy the restaurant s evening meal was a disappointment for me although my wife was happy with her meal to be fair the hotel responded to our complaint and we were happy with that the staff were uniformly excellent especially the spanish cook at breakfast who took such a pride in his work and quality of service there should be some type of guide on how to work the lights and air conditioning it s all programmed so it s a bit difficult to understand at first very clean and modern the customer service was slow when we checked in it was a slow process we waited   minutes for luggage to be brought in the room and the bags tag had incorrect details we asked for ice bucket and nobody came the location was convenient and the views were amazing the mini bar is computerised and stuffed full so if you move anything to put something of your own in to keep cool your bill is going to grow rapidly although if you notice the staff are happy to sort for you unfortunately the computer system was down on checking out and still   hours later still not received any promised invoice or bill the location for the o  is perfect and removes any stress i should have asked for a room with a view as my view wasn t very picturesque air con pipes that s my only quibble the staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was more than adequate the bircher muesli was scrumptious a very pleasant stay no negative the stay was fantastic absolutely no issues whatsoever helpful and friendly staff lovely clean rooms absolutely no complaints whatsoever the best possible place to stay for an event at the o  would definitely book again everything was fine the beds were extremely comfortable and the room spacious and well appointed the only meal we had was breakfast which was excellent we were going to the o  and the best thing was the hotel location effectively you didn t have to go outside to go from one building to the other we will definitely use the hotel again in these circumstances drinks in the sky bar expensive but well this is london bed and pillows were so so comfy very friendly and helpful staff very clean loved the sky bar views and the closeness to the o  it is not clear when booking that you have to pay   per night for parking it is on the list that you have to pay if you scroll down but when booking it indicates there is no need to reserve parking this to me implies it is included easy access to the o  arena very clean hotel and friendly professional staff we never used the on site facilities or restaurants but everyone that we spoke to seemed impressed with them we used the facilities in the o  as we were attending a weekend event we did not find any fault wonderful location for the   easy access to the cable car and river clippers very friendly and knowledgeable staff the hotel was immaculately clean room was spacious breakfast was included with our room and there was every item imaginable available we only stayed one night but wished it could have been longer it was a lovely break and hope to stay again the coffee in the room the coffee in the room was a bit to strong but you can get coffee in any of the restaurantsame so not a problemember all the staff are brilliant i will be going back toilet looked like it had been flushed but bowl not cleaned coffee machine still had one used pod in it not enough coffee and milk in the room only enough for one coffee each unless you wanted decaff and much more milk please nice bed plenty of room good selection for breakfast no negative first time using this hotel and am not disappointed the room including the bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy given that the hotel was busy on the weekend we stayed the staff all had smiles and remained friendly and helpful the lifts were quick no long waits for one to arrive breakfast had quite a spread it has something for everyone loved having the back passageway through to o  so convenient and could come and go as we please during the opening times very useful to use to attend the concerts at the o  arena i hope i would be fortunate enough to stay here again after returning from the strictly event at the   we went to the bar the bar was very under staffed over half hour wait to be served lots of people very unhappy one member of staff said where did you all come from surely staff know when events end and should expect bars to be busy it really let the hotel down room with a view beautiful no negative staff are so helpful and the hotel is outstanding absolutely amazing hotel to stay at the view from the hotel room was so amazing and it was very easy to access public transport from the hotel location having to leave it everything was perfect we can t fault this hotel from the staff to the food to the drinks to the room etc everything was amazing definitely recommend this hotel the breakfast in room took a long time to arrtive and then it was incomplete not the best   out of   staff were absolutely amazing i really felt that i had landed in a foreign holiday country big compliment from me breakfast was a rip off and my room was opposite a door to the stairs that was being slammed all night bed very compfy staff all smiling and welcomingno negative payed for a room upgrade worth every penny absolutely stunning views room service was delicious staff very polite and friendly loved that the hotel is connected to london o  made going to see drake boy meets world tour even more enjoyable and quicker queuing time the dry sauna was not operational that was a shame as had been looking to using it great views over london breakfast was fantastic the pool and spa areas exceptional room and beds really comfy and well laid out great hotel took a while for luggage to arrive to our room was heading out and needed to get ready so a little frustrating great stay at an amazing hotel staff polite and helpful check in and out smooth it was my partners birthday and the staff left a cake and balloons in the room which was a nice touch sky top bar was excellent room service was prompt and delicious loved everything it was such an amazing hotel lovely bathroom massive comfortable bed attached to the o  absolutely amazing and definitely worth the money honestly nothing all perfect the whole hotel was unbelievable every single staff member treated us like we were celebrities will be returning many times to this hotel on event nights the bar on top floor gets so full you can t get in it was a shame as we had tried to go there before the event in the afternoon but it didn t open until  pm we were only staying one night and it was first visit to this hotel so would have loved to experience the views from the bar at night the other bar was open so we went there but still had to queue for   minutes for drinks at    pm the servers did not serve people in order of arrival which was a little frustrating i was queing alone next to another woman and the big groups of guests or couples were served first despite me pointing out that i had been there before them to the bar staff this put me off and was a shame as we probably were paying the same price to stay there and everyone should expect the same service whether a returning guest or a business guest or simple a guest staying for leisure purposes if you like firm pillows ask at reception as the pillows in room are like marshmallows rooms very clean and spacious lots of extra touches and room ready before we were due to check in which was great the breakfast choice was fantastic high quality food and staff so welcoming it was very busy but still they went out of their way to serve with a smile the speakers in the bathroom are a lovely extra surprise and enabled us to play music via bluetooth could even listen to the news in the shower view from bedroom great too quality of sleep great no noises from other doors closing or anyone walking down corridors or traffic very impressed the view of the o  dome not expected but for one night it would have been nice to have the city view staff were friendly and efficient breakfast was awesome and the tasting menu pretty good thanks for a fab stay the prices for using the mini bar rather excessive absolutely love the location of this hotel for the o  makes a lovely overnight break when going to a concert the breakfast is well worth paying the extra for sets you up for the day especially when you are off shopping at the westfield centre air con set to  c the room was far too hot apparently many people had complained as we did to the receptionist as we checked out the bed was really very comfortable the breakfast could have been hotter my wife received two insect bites during the night the views were great as was the proximity to the   the staff were all very attentive my sister could t check in when she arrived first as booking was in my name floor in swimming pool could have been cleaner bed linen very comfy breakfast fantastic poached eggs provided on request receptionist upgraded our room because had stressful situation on arrival friendly staff throughout room wasn t ready for us after a day of travelling at  pm we were two friends who had travelled from both ends of the country to meet for a concert at the o  we were offered the spa to get changed for the concert by the chap who dealt with us initially problems only sorted when concierge upgraded us and we made it to concert on time location next to o  no complaints apart from hairdryer could have been easier to use it had a coil lead which after plugging in to use hairdryer i had to keep pulling it towards me when i dried my hair which made my arm ache fantastic proximity to   clean very comfortable would definitely recommend coffee making machine in bedroom poor the only fault i could make about my stay breakfast excellent staff very helpful hotel very clean overall i will probably stay at the hotel again can t think of anything really lovely room great views and bed was very comfortable indeed breakfast was also excellent all staff very friendly and cheerful could not get access to the sky bar all seats taken which was really disappointing would have stood up but not allowed in refused at the gate bed was very comfortable the place was clean staff good slightly disappointed that we had to queue for lifts upon return to the hotel after the rod stewart concert and also for entry to the sky bar on the  th floor the hotel was excellent very well appointed rooms and will definitely use again unable to get food after a concert at   apart from room service suggest on concert nights food is served later very comfy bed and soft towels location to   superb the full english breakfast was not hot all items just about warm expensive at   per head the lighting in the room was not bright enough to read the instructions for the coffee machine the size of the suite was amazing with great views of the river thames convenient for the o  arena appreciate its london prices but   for a glass of red and a vodka tonic seems a little high maybe it s the sky bar view you pay for the quality and professional staff were very impressive had a issue early on a sunday morning and the door staff and concierge were so helpful trying to find an open pharmacy location so close to the stadium means a five minute walk back and no sitting in car park for two hours trying to get out worth the cost alone as much as the cocktails look and the   we tried tasted fantastic the price did seem very high the rooms are amazing the extra touches like a speaker in the bathroom which plays whatever is on the telly everything is of a high standard breakfast was unbelievable the selection from cereals to fruit smoothies and muffins the cooked choices were fantastic tasted so fresh fabulous hotel and well worth paying extra for what you get there was nothing i didn t like excellent hotel loved it easy to get to the o  i will certainly be back if i go to another concert the room was comfortable and so was the bed the staff were all very friendly and helpful no negative super location for o  really attentive staff especially vijay the concierge sky bar on  th floor was good for a nightcap and views over the thames breakfast was fantastic so much variety it took   minutes to get a ice bucket to the room also we had the cleaner just let herself in without knocking we didn t have a do not disturb sign the hotel was lovely we got upgraded as it was a special occasion just beautiful i would   stay here again in fact i recommended my parents to stay there tonight which they are the swimming pool in the spa was beautiful but it doesn t look like it gets cleaned until the end of the day piles of used towels and robes everywhere no clean towels in the men s changing rooms floors were filthy we actually didn t stay long because of this the staff were so friendly whether at check in or at one of the two bars the rooms are finished to a high standard as you would expect with intercontinental superb luxurious bathrooms again high quality finish loved the eighteen sky bar and clipper bar expensive drinks which is a shame i d like to have stayed longer everything was excellent only downside was the building work at the   meant we got a bit wet as it was raining for which i do not hold the hotel responsible bed was super soft breakfast was superb very clean hotel and ideal for the   arena parking costs for guests are abit steep at   a night very friendly staff extremely clean and well designed room service was great facilities were perfect and the short distance from the o  arena was so convenient it was perfect staff were outstanding made us feel special really good nights sleep beds really comfy i could go on and on but probably best hotel we have ever stayed in nothing we had a fantastic stay everything the best hotel we have ever stayed in the room was amazing the facilities brilliant and the breakfast was top notch it would have been nice to have two duvets instead of one breakfast was great the staff was very friendly and helpfull the room was neat and big enough the hotel was modern no negative everything was fab staff couldn t have been more helpful the hotel location was perfect and facilities were great i would highly recommend this the lady who check us into the room left us waiting for   mins and only when my husband ask if our room was ready yet this was  pm and she just gave us our keys without a sorry for the wait breakfast was amazing wonderful staff and excellant location breakfast supplied huge array of options but cooked options could have been a bit hotter excellent staff well presented room with everything we could need extremely comfortable bed and furnishings sky bar provided excellent service and views paying by debit card meant that i had to pay for everything as i went and couldn t get access to the mini bar that doesn t work for me great view from my hotel room breakfast was poor and had to pay deposit of   pound when i got there only for i had my card but very expensive deposit to make sure the room is left in perfect condition room was very nice and view was amazing the staff and service in ground floor restaurant the staff were extremely slow and sometimes made mistakes with orders but all in all were very polite rooms were spacious it was a fab hotel for brit awards i stayed here because of a flight delay at london city airport and would not have picked this area of london otherwise it is far from any amenities sadly plus i have stayed in many   star hotels around the world and would give this one     stars just does not have the details that make a truly   star hotel staff very good room very quiet and bed very comfy temperature control in room very good i can t really fault anything maybe few more hangers beds at the swimming pool or a better rate for customer about the car park would help but nothing major i really loved this hotel the location the view the building is absolutely stunning the staff very helpful and makes a big difference x the staff cleanliness and breakfast were the highlights of our stay the leisure facilities were excellent as were the bedrooms and location for the purpose of our visit will be back mini bar over priced and car park hospitality was excellent all staff were polite and helpful would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family nothing to dislike the warmest welcome when we arrived david the doorman was very kind and helpful staff were extremely helpful and the hotel is amazing very modern would stay again anytime the floor around the pool and in the spa was quite dirty with a lot if hair and could have been cleaned more often i stayed in room on the  th floor and the view was absolutely superb our bed was very comfortable there was a funny smell of smoke when we first arrived in our room however this was not a massive issue as we really appreciated the bathroom speaker view from our window and comfy bed room wasn t ready when we arrived despite being told at front desk it was on arriving at room it was still being cleaned amazing views from our room fabulous breakfast everything possible you could choose from nothing to complain about however the pool was a little on the cold side could do with it being heated excellent stay staff were very attentive we rang front desk for harder pillows member of staff was at the door within   minutes couldn t fault the place anything that was moved from the fridge was charged we did not take anything but i wanted to look on checkout we were charged   but the staff took the charge back extra comfy bed great selection and quality of food available for breakfast very friendly staff i didn t like that when i arrived with my daughter at  pm i was told they had no room for me and wouldn t have anything for another two hours obviously i was not happy with this at all as this was unacceptable and we were due at the o  for a concert at     i asked to see the manager with whom i didn t get to see and was then given a room upgrade later check out and complimentary drink the view the room and the very comfortable bed the easy accessibility to the o  and the staff in general and very friendly bar girl in the clipper bar food was really pricy  th floor sky bar slightly boring only good thing was the view looking up to canary wharf   charge every time you order to your room nice and comfy bed amazing views staff and service was excellent booking com mislead me and staff at hotel not cooperative and very rude and made it the fault of booking com hence i will never use booking com again the hotel was excellent a couple of members of staff were rude and condescending ticket machine tried to charge me   when i hadn t even been there  hours the big shower head was grimy check in was at   but our room wasn t ready til gone   we had an amazing view of canary wharf most staff were polite and helpful as it was a birthday they upgraded us to deluxe the only fault i would say would be the check in was very late the facilities were fantastic the staff were really friendly we was upgraded upon arrival and the location view from the room was perfect would have been nice if someone enplaned the workings of the room i had to call down many time as i was unsure how to work or find things in room location staffno negative enjoyed my stay and everything was perfect although the hotel is a bit pricey the quality justifies the price they charge recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn t mind spending extra money for extra comort the steam room wasn t good and the size of the pool could have been deeper and bigger the view and then bed was just what i wanted speakers in the bathroom was a great touch no negative after emailing the hotel with a pretty big request of preparing the room romantically for valentine s day using stuff that i had ordered to the hotel they set it up exactly as described in my email which was very specific as to where things should go and on top of this lina left a card wishing us happy vday and some chocolates the small touches made a big difference and i also thought the staff were so friendly value for money no negative service from every single individual staff member we came across was absolutely outstanding we felt right at home from the moment we parked up in the car park our bags were taken straight away and checking in couldn t have went any smoother would definitely recommend it was my birthday and wedding anniversary our room was very cold the first three hours was freezing and the reception was very poor frustrating the manager later gave us a voucher to access the internet having said that everything else was just spot on the hotel is sparkling clean lovely breakfast spa nice view comfy bed terrible view from room overlooking side of heating ducts could not get breakfast in morning as to many people trying to get served at same time had to miss it no room in restaurant no positive poo in the toilet not flushed and toilet wouldn t flush was happy we was accommodated two classes up as a result of this staff were nice and breakfast was good i booked a valentine s decoration the vase of rose wasn t looks good it was just put in a paper bag but not a vase the location of the hotel is a bit far from the centre the staffs are really friendly and helpful pool and spa is great my girlfriend and i also love the bar on the  st floor and  th floor there was insufficient staff in the second floor bar and the wait was far to long for an order to be filled even though the bar manager phoned on three occasions for assistance none came the view was breathtaking and the proximity to the o  couldn t be better there were two brown stains on the carpet in our room which was disappointing considering we paid   for one night in a superior room the menu guide on the tv was faulty and when it did finally work it would not let us press select on the options spotify etc the speakers in the bathroom were also much quieter than when we stayed the first time to such an extent they were mostly pointless things i would not expect of such a luxurious hotel rather a long queue for breakfast an array of delicious choices for breakfast lovely informative and helpful staff lovely bath and shower glorious bed perfect for o  speakers in bathroom lovely view only   bar staff on  nd floor bar so when a lot of guests got back from   concert there was an extra long wait to get served at the bar so we have up after  minutes this was our only complaint earlier in the day in the mid afternoon it had been fine breakfast was fantastic for choice staff all seemed happy and obliging service at the clipper bar was very slow and it wasn t until later that we realised that we had been charged for service we were not sure if this was a voluntary or compulsory charge as this wasn t mentioned we booked the hotel as we were going to an event at the o  the room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful perhaps making the sky bar larger as it has brilliant views but unfortunately not enough room for everyone to enjoy them i cannot fault anything we thoroughly enjoyed our stay right from being greeted at the door to checking out nothing was too much trouble for the staff and what a fantastic location the hotel is in everyone should treat themselves to a little luxury and stay at this hotel there were not enough staff serving in the two bars during that very busy period when guests had returned from the o  arena show   minutes to get a drink is excessive and many guests left without no positive my duvet was blood stained and felt although the staff were lovely and i didn t make a fuss on reflection i feel having paid     i was not offered a refund or any other compensation it would be nice to have something to makeup for the inconvenience the staff food and cocktails are very pricey so be ready to fork out but it is a   start hotel the room was extra large with   bathrooms and the staff were very helpful very big and busy so stafff not that friendly cleared our table including full drinks and stuff from chairs when in breakfast queue mattress topper made bed very hot location right next to o  no bath towels in room only hand towels one of the glasses had chip in rim and cut my lip room a little hot for comfort but that s being a bit picky would have moaned if it had been cold chocolate in mini fridge very expensive especially if you have kids   for a small bar of dairy milk really link to o  venue excellent staff brilliant and so polite sure they would have sorted out towel query if i had asked but should not have passed inspection really really clean parked out front very convenient to finish on a positive the bed wow as good as mine at home the view wasn t quite as advertised spa could have massage facilities breakfast wasn t that nice lovely room staff were friendly facilities were good plenty of photo ops several times we had to ask maintenance to come up and fix our toilet which they did and every time we were greeted with a friendly member of staff however persistent running of water which kept us up a lot of the night gave up asking someone to come fix it in the end and the flush would just stop working every now and then the bed was comfy and the room was lovely and large location to the o  was just perfect ideal for the late nights after a gig and early starts if you would want a breakfast coffee elsewhere no negative staff were very welcoming and attentive from the outset and for the duration of our stay the room was superb clean and extremely comfortable this was the perfect location in which to stay to ensure our overall o  experience was memorable could have been told what floor my room was and about the restaurants in the hotel no literature in room with information of the facilities of the hotel i was able to link my phone trough the television and play my music there was a bose speaker in the bathroom it was heaven as i could have a relaxing bath and listen to my music cost although you get what you pay for the inability to have a light meal on arrival we arrived at   and had an early start that said ordering cake with our coffee hit the spot the comfort of the room proximity to the o  and facilities     discretionary service charge added to everything the nettle shampoo strange smell nothing else at all the staff the bed bedding pillows cleanliness choice of restaurants bars location next to   close to tube the view at night over the river breakfast was amazing so much choice soundproofing no negative everyone specially the chef was very friendly and helpful the passage to o  arena was really useful going to the concert and coming back was unbelievably easy and comfortable i couldn t have the mini bar as the door was broken and awaiting to be fixed so had to go to the tesco to get alcohol and treats staff room and the view nothing a must place to stay if you are attending an event at the o  the hotel itself is fantastic modern and has a touch of quality compared to others the rooms are faultless with one of the comfiest beds i have ever slept in stylish bathroom with good shower not to mention the built in bose speakers in the ceiling they re quality cracking views over looking the river and the arena itself staff were also super helpful and approachable if it is the price putting you off don t let it its worth every penny would definitely stay again no negative absolutely fantastic place to stay me and my partner didn t want to leave the service was amazing so friendly and willing to help in any way to make your stay that much better we stayed here because we were going to a concert at the o  and loved the fact that you could walk straight in from the hotel the bedroom was lovely very high end finish and could tell that your comfort was top priority when it was designed and built talking about comfort the bed was the best iv slept in and when i got home my own bed felt inadequate will   be staying here on my next visit to london price of the parking was very expensive just for one night such a warm welcome when we entered very convenient in terms of visiting the o  breakfast was perfect   best hotel i ve been to for breakfast selection was amazing classic cooked continental fruits yogurts smoothies my partner doesn t eat pork and there was vegi options in terms for the breakfast and alternative meats in the sausages staff went above and beyond in there service spa facilities were amazing and was a lot to do on sight so not much need to leave hotel   service   recommend and i ll be back again the room was nice but personally i didn t think it was worth the money that it cost the handle in the shower fell off and the water was changing from hot to cold we paid for a river view but what we got was mostly car park it also wasn t explained to us very well we would be charged an extra   on top of the room incase we used room service or mini bar the lady at reception explained this would be refunded however i am still awaiting this refund on the website it states   for parking however we ended up paying   no positive expectation of room from booking com was it would have several windows for the view but only had one not really a negative attention to detail was spot on specifically things like toiletries which included items such nail files tooth brush and tooth paste rarely seen quality shampoo etc everything to make you feel comfortable extra large bed and soft duvet covers ensured i had a very comfortable sleep view of the river and o  was impressive location to the o  couldn t have been better literally a   minute walk once you get out of the lift lots of bars and restaurants nothing the location with the walk way through to the o  the views and the overall comfort of the room all excellent the breakfast was very good too we would recommend this hotel loved it and can t wait to go back disappointed with the breakfast compared to the last time we were there coffee in the rooms are disgusting and every time we ordered a tea or coffee it was just barely warm and when pointed this out to staff they didn t seem interested and replaced with warm tea and coffee the location is perfect very good staff and lovely rooms there were some indiscrepancies with my room they were resolved quickly and one of which was taken seriously to be investigated at a later date i was offered a free upgrade for my next visit staff were really lovely very professional and they treated me well i was unaware that u get charged as soon as you take anything from the mini bar even if you don t use it and put it back service was amazing as soon as we walked through the door no negative bed was so comfortable the shower amazing all the extra bits coffee machine etc didn t manage to visit the spa as we had a show to get too staff so friendly will definitely be booking again the room was smaller than i had expected the staff couldn t have been more helpful and welcoming our room was lovely clean and modern the bed was so comfortable and the black out curtains certainly did the trick the view from the room up along the river with the o  in the foreground was great upon arrival we took advantage of the swimming pool and spa area clean and relaxing we went to the o  for the evening the  minute walk back to our room was the best part of our entire stay we even had time to call into the bar for a drink and enjoy the views of canary wharf before bed breakfast was fantastic they had everything you could have asked for and more no negative the room was immaculate the views were fantastic and breakfast was wonderful altogether a fantastic experience there is also a walkway that connects the hotel to the o  arena which was so convenient as it was raining the staff were exceptional extremely attentive and couldn t do enough for us thank you very much intercontinental room was a bit warm but they sorted it and the prices was a bit overboard but overall we ll certainly be back everything was just amazing the people the room the facilities beautiful we had a simple request for ice which became more complex than it could have been it was resolved in the end the proximity to the o  arena the quality of the facilities and the food the impeccable service complicated coffee machine which did not perform as per instructions provided exit to o  venue not clearly shown so first time exited through main doors and slightly confused of whereabouts modern hotel friendly staff perfect location good television no negative friendly attentive staff amazing comfy bed great city views lovely food chilled atmosphere beautiful decor a fabulous treat for my sister and i every thing was perfect the service levels provided from entering the hotel even before entering the reception and until we left again was in a levels so high you cannot learn it you live it meal in the meridian lounge was not to the same standard as breakfast breakfast was excellent general amenities to a very high standard overall experience was excellent though expensive sausages at breakfast good old english ones would have been better location fab bed so comfy staff very courteous friendly breakfast best i ve had in a long while maybe a small fridge in the room for our use but that is being petty bed really comfy staff very attentive one gave us a tour of the ballroom as we were looking through the window as she walked past lovely decor and really comfortable will definitely stay again the fire alarm being tested at  am very convenient for the   with a   minute walkway beautiful comfy bed nice large room the view from the sky bar was amazing our room smelt a bit we weren t sure if it was a cleaning product that had been used or if it was due to a previous customer bed and pillows were really comfy all the staff were very helpful and welcoming lovely hotel no negative the pillows were amazing so soft never felt anything like them our view was excellent we were greeted before we entered the hotel by a lovely gentleman in a top hat we were attending the nta in o  hence our choice of this hotel price was quite high for the general area and was probably hiked because of the awards ceremony it was excessive all staff at hotel were extremely courteous and helpful absolutely first class treatment in all areas we really enjoyed the hotel excellentno negative absolutely loved this place everything was perfect location staff very helpful facilities spacious room massive choice for breakfast would love to bring the family back with us steam room not working no shampoo in either ladies or gents spa ladies also had no body wash for a year and a half old hotel some parts of the spa were rusting metal surrounds hotel decoration and attention to detail the welcome was the best we have experienced in the uk from andrei easy access to the o  and the spa facilities were appreciated too room view was stunning and room comfortabilty of the highest standard breakfast was vast with a superb choice for both a meat eater and vegetarian will be staying again the shower was cold the two single beds i requested were pushed together to make a double bed never nice when i was sharing a room with my brother the receptionist was rude got woken up by the cleaners having a shouting conversation in the hall way the only good thing about this hotel was how close it is to the o  arena no positive nothing loved it duvet pillows were super soft and comfy and the shower was fab amazing breakfast never seen such a choice ate it by the window looking over the thames the pre show set menu dinner was absolutely delicious the walkway through to the o  was really convenient the staff couldn t have been more helpful attentive hope to stay again soon nothing me and my friend went to a show at the o  and stayed the night we got a great deal on price and the stay was amazing the hotel staff were amazing and were there to answer all my questions and help as a disabled guest i was offered information about fire alarm emergencies and felt very safe there the room was immaculate and all our requests like early check in high floor room and extra pillows were given a little dramatic but i cried a little when i had to leave i want to stay again now the afternoon tea we had was over priced and the quality of food didn t match the price the english breakfast was very poor eggs far to oily bacon chewy and poor taste hash browns chewy and poor quality basically don t eat here and your onto a winner the bed was pure luxury and room very clean we were told we couldn t sit at a particular table area but another member of staff said it was fine to have the window area selection was fantastic and quality of the food was very good indeed for the misses to call the desk asking for non featherd duvet pillows to be sent up because of allergies only for the porter to bring up   non feathed pillow   featherd pillows another featherd duvet so we wacked the heating up slept in no bed clothes loved the sky bar the range of whiskys were superb the french waiter new his stuff fair play the room was very warm and there was no way to reduce the temperature below   degrees i m sure that s great for some people but i found it a bit too warm to sleep comfortably beautiful hotel and the staff were cheerful and helpful location is great for the o  and breakfast was delivered to the room on time and was lovely nothing at all the staff were so polite and couldn t do enough for you opened all the doors for you etc the breakfast choice was amazing and food was outstanding the room was stunning and so clean the facilities were amazing and all round the best hotel i ve ever stayed in can t wait to go back made our weekend away perfect no negative everything was amazing staff very friendly and extremely helpful location and appearance of hotel was exceptional expensive option but you get what you pay for one small niggle which i will be speaking to the hotel about but other than that would be my first choice when visiting the o  in future no negative best thing about this hotel is the bed it s an absolute dream staff are amazing friendly and very helpful  nd time staying absolutely love it the smell that seemed like it was cannabis which after the cleaner came and sprayed a small amount of spray to try and hide the smell did not leave when asked they explained this was through the air vents but was unbearable in the morning also when we went into our room there was already someone else s luggage there but after ringing reception we were moved rooms the smell though was unbearable how close it was to the o  and that there was an entrance from the hotel to the o  bed was really comfy and great shower and bath nothing fantastic location we were going to the   for a show and it was so convenient loads of restaurants close to underground station hotel was perfect upgraded to a room with a view as it was our anniversary guest relations provided desserts delivered to our room beds were so comfortable highly recommended we will be back no negative location was ideal as we went to see impractical jokers in o  arena and the bed was so comfy i wanted to take it home with me and the bathroom having separate shower and bath was a good touch we put our breakfast in room request on our door but breakfast did not turn up it did not turn up so had to re order which took over an hour to arrive at our room i d suggest more milk pouches in the room to go with tea or coffee the bed and room was comfy the views from the room very good and close to the o  we arrived without toothbrush and paste which the hotel supplied us with the in house food was very expensive as was the mini bar however food from outside the venue could be taken in the door staff were very helpful the room was spacious and clean fantastic service charge added to drinks even when you go to the bar yourself to get them is the only criticism bed was the comfiest bed i ve ever slept in staff all friendly and attentive and in a brilliant location highly impressed the fact that they add a     tip on at the bars for bringing you a drink it tells you on tiny writing at the bottom of the menu this is extra annoying considering you are already paying premium prices for the alcohol great location a   minute walk to the o  great view from our room out over the river beautiful room and a massive comfy bed couldn t ask for more room service was very poor facilities were fantastic and staff couldn t do enough for you we re upgraded for free without asking to a room with river view excellent no negative the bed was really comfortable the view from the room was right over the river thames which was lovely the bathroom had a shower and bath and the staff were really helpful i forgot my hairdryer and asked the receptionist and got one sent to my room in   minutes couldn t fault this hotel was a very enjoyable stay and will definitely be booking again some of the foreign staff couldn t understand me and i had to repeat myself but i have got a welsh accent so i can understand why excellent service would definitely recommend to anyone no negative excellent location the hotel has a short cut to the o  so you can walk there in approx   mins also the staff were so helpful and could not do enough for you dinner was brilliant and breakfast had the best choice of fruit and salad and cooked breakfast i have ever seen the only problems we noted were that the tea served to us at breakfast was cold and the food in the buffet was only warm they could have been a little hotter when we rang to confirm our booking the receptionist said that they were aware we were coming for my husband s birthday and said that they would make sure amenities would be available for us in the room though she couldn t say what i don t know what we expected to find but was ever so slightly disappointed that all there was waiting for us was   little chocolates you would think for the price of the room and the amount you pay in the bar and for room service etc that the hotel could have pushed the boat out a little bit more the staff were very friendly breakfast was absolutely wonderful so much choice we found the hotel to be in a great location for what we were there for the main area of the hotel is luxurious and the check in was very quick and our bag was brought to our room promptly no negative excellent location if you re planning on visiting the o  it s literally a walkway away gorgeous views and immaculate room hotel is located in a very peaceful and quiet area lovely d cor to make you feel at home and great bathroom with a powerful shower staff are accommodating at all times and provide exceptional customer service breakfast was divine couldn t fault my stay at all couldn t get the room any cooler and it was hard to sleep when it was so warm amazing location the staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for you food in the restaurant was lovely the prices could have been a little better as i was doing a proposal and did set me back a bit how the rooms were very updated with technology the view was amazing and lina who helped organise my proposal no negative location excellent watched show at o  for other halfs birthday treat staff at intercontinental were helpful friendly and couldn t do enough for you no queuing at check in decor and views of thames city amazing nothing everything was just spot on views out the window were superb all the added luxury s were great great value for money considering location i was told parking was free until i checked out and had to pay i mean for how much i paid   for   nights the view wasn t what i wanted and ive stayed in better hotels for that price the hotel in general was beautiful but i feel i was ripped off with the service charges on top of the ridiculous prices for food and tea spa area around the pool could be cleaner it was a bank holiday so staff shortages could be to blame very comfortable bed really well designed bedroom with great views fantastic breakfast we stayed here for ny all service was incredibly slow things like coffe machine and etc were missing in the room and we spent ages waiting for it during the breakfast the drinks are served very slow too plus the chemicals in the swimming pool especially hot tub is so strong that gave us both my partner and i an allergy and bloodshot eyes for   days in addition minibar is with sensors so although we took things out to make our own water cooler and didn t use any of the goods and placed them back we got charged so it is always recommended to double check your bill in this hotel last but not least we paid extra for a river view room but got only a partial view i would not say it is worth the money in general i would not stay at this hotel again as from my experience when one is paying   for a night a way better experience could be expected breakfast is really nice and with great choice all staff member are very friendly had to wait for about     mins for sausages at breakfast pretty poor for a   star but that was the only problem with the stay extra comfy beds service was excellent the spa felt like a swimming pool with loads of children the aircon didn t work no air in the room the light switch fel out in the middle of the night wasn t as good as the  st time i stayed disappointing really lovely hotel setting friendly staff perhaps changing the   service charge for room service as we ended up paying out numerous times for little bits that we needed otherwise perfect hotel everything stunning hotel one of the best we ve stayed in views standard of room food pool location everything was spot on thank you it was also our anniversary and the lovely gentleman at reception gave us a free room upgrade to the most beautiful room the staff made our trip even more perfect can t praise them enough thank you thank you thank you wish i booked for longer there s nothing i can fault i had a wonderful stay and look forward to going back great service welcoming and helpful staff they exceed the standards expected and has to be one of the best i ve ever stayed in we were assigned a room that already had people in it upon arriving to the room we saw belongings of other guests e g suitcases shoes etc we had to go back to reception and be given another room the beds were so comfortable could have slept forever i didn t want to move the room i booked said it would have a river view however wouldn t exactly classify it as a river view the staff were extremely friendly the location was good the hotel as a whole was excellent the facilities were superb nothing all fantastic beds very comfy staff not snooty very welcoming and just generally really nice and helpful food lovely at breakfast unfortunately we couldnt afford dinner as not rich but we tried a cocktail and had a few cheaper drinks and had a fantastic time will save up for next year when i checked in i had to wait in a spa for over an hour after being told i would be contacted i had to approach the reception desk out that i have to stay in a different room to the one i paid for of less value the bed was extra comfy cleanliness was beautiful nothing the staff were very smartly dressed extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of the area and amenities car park is very convenient and plenty of spaces available no negative very nice comfy beds lovely staff lovely pool and spa area really enjoyed my stay nice views watching all the fireworks going off on new year s eve the location of the hotel is close from the metro but still need to walk around  min to get to the reception the price of the breakfast is high but expected for such a kind of hotel the room was clean and confortable the staff really kind the spa is great i recommend and i will be back there for my next trip in london breakfast service a bit slow ordered an omelette which took   minutes to arrive after being chased and was nearly raw however everything else was fine and we all make mistakes no positive sky bar staff unhelpful in wouldn t accommodate a table where it was possible unreserved wouldn t arrange delivery of wine to our room and drinks overpriced spa rooms distance to   reception staff excellent instead of delivering our   suitcases to our room they were placed on a bus to heathrow by carelessness after waiting in the room only our last minute trip back downstairs saved our luggage from being lost no positive receptionist who checked us in was moody and devoid of friendliness or a smile room was comfortable however it was characterless and generic we could have been anywhere breakfast was chaotic nobody was there to take you to a table had to wait   minutes for coffee staff at the sky bar were friendly small problem with dinner as we didn t have time for dessert due to slow service but this was sorted out and taken off our bill as was the service charge and when we checked out and mentioned this they waived the parking charge as well so very pleased with service the hotel is really lovely room was excellent bed extremely comfy breakfast was very good ideal if going to the   as you can walk from the hotel in just a few minutes took way to long to get a drink at the sky bar breakfast for       way too expensive no instruction or details in the rooms or prices on the mini bar items pool spacious clean rooms and right next to o  only wish was that the sky bar stayed open longer or we were allowed access to sit and enjoy the view we were turned away when they stopped serving drinks even though i told them all we wanted to do is sit and enjoy the view without drinkingno positive car park charge of   which we were not aware of there are no signs to tell you that charge exists or that you have to pay at reception staff were very very unhelpful it needs to be made clearer on the websirte and before entering the carpark would never have gone there will not return no positive hard to fault except perhaps price breakfast is   each so i recommend visiting one of the many breakfast options in the o  just a short walk away also there was a faulty light in the bedroom that seemed to be flickering a sos message a very nice new hotel with the biggest benefit being its close location to the o  in fact it is connected via a hallway directly to the o  as well a large car park but not free unlike so many london hotels it feels very open and spacious we were given a corner room with a brilliant view of both the o  and the thames also in room coffee machine was better than normal staff very friendly and helpful the staff could have been slightly less enthusiastic as it made the friendliness and knowledge seem like an act and as if it wasn t real the price of the items in the mini fridge were extremely overpriced too     for a shot of jack daniels     for a kit kat etc the room was spotless and the bathroom was outstanding the bathroom had basics like shampoo conditioner but also had an emery nail board cotton buds cotton pads and more the view from room   was breathtaking needed extra milk but that was sorted through reception needed more bar staff in the sky bar took a while to be served the bathroom very spacious loved the coffee machine and the sky bar wasvgreat i didn t not like having to pay   for parking for one night location of the hotel was really good i was heading to a concert at the   and what i found great was the hotel had its own link to the arena so we did not need to walk   mins to the arena the room was so nice we got an upgrade to a conner view room which was lovely definitely will stay there again i would stay longer than one night no negative perfect for going to o  back exit of hotel takes you straight into the arena lovely rooms and staff were really helpful going back in january and glad i booked there again already especially good when leaving arena as tube taxis are a nightmare we were out and back in our room in minutes no negative the proximity to the   was awesome perfect if you want to make a real evening of seeing a band the bar on the top floor is awesome after a gig with great views over canary wharf female who checked us in was not friendly which was disappointing location to o  meet and greet at the entrance to hotel was exceptional the gentleman made us extremely welcome which was lovely no negative the staff were the friendliest most helpful people they couldn t do enough for us the room was really clean and the bed was so comfortable thank you and what a view there is a walkway to the o  so it was great to be so close to the venue no negative perfect hotel in london the view is spetacular esp from the bar the hotel to stay if you want to attend an event at the o  arena you reach the arena thru a special hallway fantastic nothing gorgeous suite the bathroom was really fab soft fluffy towels a really comfy bed nice to have a coffee machine in room too location is excellent for events at o  cocktails were a bit expensive luxurious with lots of modern twists music in the bathroom fabulous view from bar   and perfectly located for o  events best breakfast ever they have everything rude staff locked mini fridge because we didn t have a credit card   tray charge overpriced food a kit kat was       staff members walked into our room without knocking one walked in when my daughter was in her underwear the bed was comfy view from my room over the o  was rubbish but i didn t come for the view swimming pool was one of best hotel pools i have been in staff were very friendly and attentive food was excellent and the view from breakfast also impressive just remember parking not included in price beautiful room overlooking river great size and lovely bathroom ask for highest floor available if you have requested a reiner view both restaurants and bars lovely with great views breakfast worth the money perfect on both occasions stayed here two weekends running for concerts at o  couldn t be a more perfect location for that fabulous views of canary wharf from some rooms rooms spacious and well equipped separate shower cubical and bath small point but so nice to have   hand towels in a bathroom for two so you have one dedicated for washing hands a small attention to detail but speaks volumes had breakfast delivered to the room for both stays which comes beautifully presented see photo with proper linen napkins and table cloth etc check out is  pm so if you have had a late night you can have a nice relaxing morning breakfast in your room before heading off lots of food options around the o  plus a pharmacy and tesco express steam room wasn t working everything spotlessly clean room double superior excellently equipped and fabulous breakfast with very polite attentive staff pool area lovely we stayed here as we re going to event in o  arena and wanted to be close but would definitely stay again and travel into city centre as it was so good prices in mimi bar was very expensive coffee machine not working and no complimentary biscuits pleasant staff nice room great location for o  arena which was why we were there no negative beautiful   star hotel great location for the o  you don t even get wet rooms for roomy and extremely well equipped willl always stay there as it s only   mins to centre of london by tube couldn t believe that the only way to pay for breakfast was either cash or credit card what in this day and age is wrong with a debit card also breakfast ordered in our room was v expensive for what it was and cleaned us out of cash as we couldn t remember our credit card pin number and a bit disappointing strange quantities large amount of juice tiny amount of coffee large amount of croissants and toast just one tiny pat of butter between   we asked for more coffee and butter but surely this is basic stuff perfect location v comfy pillows nice staff excellent parking facilities very reasonable arrival and departure times absolutely nothing staff were outstanding in all areas especially simone on reception who ensued my mum was well looked after rooms bathroom immaculate and spacious beds exceptionally comfortable would return even if not attending the o  it was that good thank you no food served late at night in restaurants monday to thursday although room service available would have been nice to get a snack at about  pm after returning from concert at o  large comfy bed lovely bathroom with walk in shower and separate bath good selection of bars and restaurants great views ideal location for the o  arena with walkway straight there not a dislike but a shuttle service from north greenwich tube station would be a good idea although the walk is short in wet weather this could be an issue with some guests the overall experience was excellent tv in room didn t work properly remote control very frustrating to use and tv just kept freezing   lights were not working in room which meant that my wife could not see properly in mirror at night   was very distracting and kept flickering otherwise lovely room location to o  was great breakfast was excellent though tea and coffee was cold when served no negative went to see rod stewart the location is ideal for the o  arena the staff were all helpful friendly and the bed extra comfy breakfast was amazing i would definitely stay again   room only no brekkie pool very high chlorine content which made skin itch you are paying for the location obviously convenient for the   and well worth as a one off treat there was nothing not to like about the hotel room was spotless the bed was very comfortable duvet was very lightweight but extremely warm unlike some hotels you couldn t hear any sound from neighbouring rooms builders working on flat roof right next to side window of our room at  am we had   windows in our room one looked out on air con units which were being worked on the other looked out onto flat roof and builders tools shovels etc location to o  nothing loved it all everything is great here it s a new build light airy state of the art hotel but from a staff point of view it s like walking into any of the iconic fancy london hotels the staff are amazing and such nice people couldn t be more helpful the design of the room is thoughtful night lights bose speakers in the bathroom a shoe shine in your wardrobe latest tech so you can link your phone to the  k tv etc really happy with this hotel also the tea in the clipper bar is to die for even the basic breakfast tea tastes so good no negative best breakfast i have ever encountered the selection and quality was so impressive and i ve stayed in some of the best hotels in the world staff on reception were exceptional nothing was too much trouble and they even printed off some tickets for me perfect location for the o  to see the atp world tennis finals parking prices were high at   per   hours especially after you pay a higher premium for the room parking was validated at half price upon check out to     but to be honest i would expect free parking for guests who stay at the hotel not just half price the room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in it had great facilities the staff were ever so helpful the hotel itself was light bright spacious with contemporary d cor and everything you would expect from a london location it was amazing and just a stones throw from the o  arena i was suitably impressed would like a lower key bar as well as what is there after a madness concert it was a bit high brow but we went anyway the room had everything the room service was great at  am and the whole experience wow d my girlfriend being woken up at   in the morning by the people next door having a party in their room i did phone down to reception and they did rectify the situation everything it was lovely breakfast was particularly poor at   a head lukewarm undercooked bacon barely browned toast what appeared to be not very good quality ingredients really clean comfortable with excellent facilities   mins from o  upsetting that some of your guests woke us at  am banging on our door others swearing shouting obscenities half dressed and when asked to be quiet by my wife was bombarded with abuse not directly the hotels fault but there is a duty of care for your guests and you did know you had a mass company xmas celebration and security should have been on some floors to counter this our room was changed immediately but still experienced guest disturbances the friendliness of the staff was lovely and so helpful the hotel was always clean tidy comfortable only a small thing but it was quite busy in the bar and there were not enough staff to cope with the demand the rooms were very nice and the staff exceptionally helpful the whole hotel was spotlessly clean and the bar on the upper floor was very nice with a good view of canary wharf     service charge for what service should have a shuttle service to and from the tube station golf buggy staff were excellent and the hotel is beautiful not a hotel that you would walk to at night without feeling vulnerable however tube station is only   minutes away and we had no problem getting taxis good for traveling south of the river as you would expect congestion on roads across the river means taxi travel is very slow during rush hour staff and facilities great bed very comfortable a great night s sleep unbeatable for o  a bit pricey in the bar and general cost of food and drink within the hotel was expensive very comfortable bed probably the best i ve ever slept in excellent views from the room ideal location for the o  breakfast we only received great coffee when we asked for strong coffee it seems that they only have one strength weak unless you ask for a espresso breakfast was great dinner the previous night was so slow this hotel staff and management go out of their way to deal with all issues that are raised if expectations are not met no negative the beds are so comfortable and the view at breakfast was great the staff when greeted are so friendly and make you feel so welcome i wont stop anywhere else again in the uk apart from at these complexes for me its always the tea and coffee sugar milk etc never enough i know you can ask for more but it would be nice to have enough so you don t have to minor thing i know we went to a concert at the   and this hotel is excellent for this you don t even get wet when walking to the   if its raining that is rooms very clean and beds very comfortable everything was excellent however we missed biscuits in our room the accommodation was excellent the staff well trained and extremely polite efficient and well super the main hotel staff were lovely but those in the  th bar were a bit pretentious when we had a quick pre concert drink and it was quiet the lady who served us was lovely but when we returned after the event and it was busy the staff behaved as if we were an inconvenience when you re paying nearly   for a beer it shouldn t be too much to ask to have a glass with it the location was perfect for the o  and the bed was amazingly comfortable food and drinks are overpriced but it is a beautiful hotel so we could see past it the price to stay was also not bad at all the bed was so comfy blackout curtains were great too fabulous nights sleep loved how there is a tunnel going straight from the o  arena to the hotel after the concert straight in the hotel   seconds after concert had finished our bed had also been turned down curtains pulled and slippers out next to the bed the bose speaker in the bathroom linked to the tv was fabulous too will definitely be booking this hotel with every show we see at the o  from now on great being able to go to the rooftop bar in the evening i was booked in at  pm for a king sized deluxe room was told on arrival shortly after  pm that my room wouldn t be ready for another   mins but if i wanted i could have a room with   single beds i said i d wait and the lady on reception said she would pass me my key when it was ready   minutes later and still sat in reception i asked a male member of staff for help he found my room instantly and was very helpful but i felt if i hadn t spoken to him i would ve still been sat there lovely clean room and really liked the ease of getting to the o  arena for my gig hotel was very clean and modernno negative great hotel with lovely friendly staff great views at night over canary wharf good bars and easy access to o  good quality food and drinks and not to pricey my interaction with the reception staff gave me the impression i was an inconvenience and was not warm or friendly at all aside from this everything else was excellent no positive nothing couldn t fault it when asked for a view of the o  i couldn t have asked for more think we had the best side   view of the thames and other of the o  shower in morning only lukewarm expensive drinks in bar with     service charge noticed later this was discretionary only   cups one small and one mug only   tea bags comfy bed view of the thames very close to o  no negative we came early in the morning and room was already available for us friendly staff and north greenwich station is   meters across hotel westfield stratford is just   stops away a small remark is we have stayed at the hotel twice and each occasion we have had to ask twice for coffee at our table during breakfast very relaxing and treated as equalsno negative we stayed as we were attending a gig at the o  and it was very well located for that and avoided the aggro of getting home an expensive hotel but good service comfortable rooms and bed two well located bars and a restaurant we enjoyed but was probably   over priced a very enjoyable and relaxed even decadent over night stay and jess glynne was excellent wonderful hotel but at almost   per night it could ve been a bit more plush also be aware that the location is in a newly developed part of london so if you re in town to site see you will need to take the underground a fair distance or pay for a cab the rooms were very clean and modern the bed comfortable and the staff incredibly helpful and polite nothing springs to mind the views were amazing especially at the sky bar on the  th floor at night the christmas decorations were beautiful staff couldn t be more helpful friendly we also tried the water taxi bus back into the city it was wonderful queue at breakfast could have been dealt with a little more quickly facilities and closeness to o  friendly and efficient staff very comfy beds perfect at the end of a busy day quite a challenge to get to on foot from the underground due to work going on in o  pool was super with jacuzzi and sauna each end love the crushed ice as well great rest to recover from the awards ceremony and party good across the water views of canary wharfno negative this hotel is perfect i stay in hotels once or twice a month with either work or for some relaxation time and if you re looking to stay in london by far one of the best hotels for your money great staff great food beautiful grounds beautiful rooms lovely spa and right next to the o  service at breakfast could have been a tad better but still i am nit picking now our table wasn t properly set and waited a bit to get cutlery condiments coffee which was unfortunately not hot by the time we did get it we were upgraded to a beautiful river view room on the  th floor it was lovely with great views the only downside to this hotel was the breakfast the staff seemed to be rushing around so my feeling was that there were not enough staff on duty the service was too slow and the queues unacceptably too long we gave up and ate downstairs worth the extra money and lovely people all the staff were wonderful polite and friendly struggling to find a single thing nothing was too much trouble for the staff it is a beautiful place contemporary yet comfortable will definitely be returning for price paid should receive breakfast with no extra charge staff were friendly brilliant location for o  bed extremely comfy room and bathroom gorgeous poor offering in club poor staff attitude in sky bar not worth the extra money for a club room close to o  problem with shower door was fixed promptly comfortable bed bathroom sparkling reception staff friendly and helpful the coffee machine did not work properly the staff were approachable and helpful they made us feel welcome on returning late it was suggested we finish the evening in the sky bar which was perfect no negative all the staff were so friendly everyone said hello and breakfast omg the hotel had a corridor to the o  sooo convenient for the tennis finals no negative perfect to see tennis in o  arena connecting door easy to come by metro very clean comfortable excellent staff beautiful view on city from  th floor bar no negative location to o  beds breakfast and the bedroom view friendly atmosphere and a great nights sleep easy access to the tube into town in the morning only a   minute walk no negative from the check in to departure our experience was lovely we were there for tennis so excellent location the staff in every department we met the restaurant staff were very welcoming food was delicious staff very attentive to gluten free needs room was a delight no complaints at all hope to return thank you although the hotel arranged the taxi for me it did not come on time because of traffic the hotel staff got a taxi fro the station but it would be better if the hotel have black cab bay all staff were so attentive the only downside was breakfast was   each per day which was a little steep so we had ours in the o  building where there were quite a few choices at a fraction of the price the bed was super comfy staff were friendly and helpful and the nighttime view from our room was breathtaking convenient walkway to o  makes it even more perfect as we were there for   days at the tennis finals on request i asked for a room on a high level and when i got there i was offered a room on the  th floor and only after another request was i able to get a room on a higher floor the quality of the room and the view there was nothing we didn t like the location is excellent the staff were extremely accommodating and would do anything to help us the breakfast was very good i loved the view from our bedroom too the skyline bar at night is a must looking forward to coming back in march i couldn t find fault with anything the staff were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble and the facilities were excellent the room was so comfortable and we had everything we needed for our stay we didn t have breakfast at the hotel as we re not big eaters on a morning so   each was too expensive fabulous facilities great room superb bathroom the most comfortable bed and the best service i ve had at any hotel ever the view from our room we were probably at the side of the hotel looking over all pipes no view the rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds breakfast was excellent and staff were all very helpful parking there is so much space unused i feel that the parking should be included in the price of booking   for  hrs but if staying at hotel     for  hrs outstanding facilities spa was fabulous we did not use the restaurant as stayed in the city until late and ate there but they looked very inviting and definitely want to return and use very close to jubilee line and clipper boats taking you to the city both a   min walk from hotel rooms very comfortable spacious well equipped large comfortable bed with excellent linen good range of free beverages and large flat screen tv fantastic being able to use the pool and spa facilities after a busy day in the city to unwind as did not close until    hrs no negative we didn t avail of breakfast or any of the hotel facilities as it was a rushed stay attending an event at the   however i give this hotel ten out of ten the staff are very professional helpful and friendly the large room had a beautiful view of the estuary and skyscrapers the king sized bed was so comfortable and the pillows were sublime it was like sleeping in a hug we arrived early  pm and the staff were exceptionally kind and allowed us to check in early check out is  pm which is excellent there is a walk way from the hotel to the   which closes at  am i will definitely be returning to this hotel liked everything really not much to improve on in my opinion the beds were so comfy did not want to get up also the pillows were the best i have slept on in a hotel for along time staff very helpful and polite no negative very friendly service staff couldnt do more for me and the hotel facilities were great the room was also very well designed with great views over london will most certainly be staying here again the changing rooms of the spa had really dirty floors as people were allowed to walk with normal shoes also the changing rooms and toilets were flooded with water from the showers all that did not seem very hygienic also the tea spoons in our room had not been cleaned from previous use we enjoyed great views from most windows and the breakfast had everything we liked the pool very much and were almost alone there all of the staff was extremely friendly we were allowed to rearrange our booking to a different day even though our room was not refundable that was very nice of them no negative everything was perfect facilities views proximity to the o  was amazing and breakfast was great quality with loads of choice will definitely return we live in london but just wanted a nice local weekend away from our usual surroundings thanks especially to oscar for all his help at check in a room only rate of   gbp is a bit expensive my daughter has a very serious allergy to nuts for which she has to have nut free meals when we visited the restaurant there was no real understanding of food allergies and apart form checking with the chef there was no real effort made to resolve the issue because the hotel could not provide food we had to travel to get suitable food very friendly staff beautiful hotel although connected to the   sort of it is a long walk to and from the main   entrance not helped by building work going on at the moment room was exceptional very clean with a lovely roomy bathroom staff very attentive and the views from the bar stunning a minor dislike was paying for the car parking facility i think hotel guests should get their tickets validated excellent rooms with very comfy beds we couldn t get into the sky bar on the  th floor as it has a maximum capacity we had been to a concert and you couldn t reserve was very much a first come first serve none of the other bars had a capacity limited room hotel was fantastic perfect location for visitors going to the o  staff were friendly and helpful bed was comfortable pillows were very soft a very nice treat indeed didn t go to the spa as was literally there for a concert nothing couldn t fault it fantastic hotel great location adjacent to the o  wonderful view from our very well appointed room superb breakfast and very helpful staff sauna steam room in main pool area noisy children playing could be heard permanently great staff polite friendly sky club eighteen had amazing views beds very comfortable ridiculously expensive drinks in the sky eighteen bar on the  th floor sparkly clean very comfortable beds friendly and courteous staff great location for the o  bar with pretty night views on  th floor reception staff didn t have the greatest spoken english but perhaps they are there for their proficiency in other languages proximity to o  arena so easy to get to the concert i failed to get the coffee machine to actually produce a cup of coffee baffling since it was exactly the same one that i have at home however all was remedied by being given free coffee in the coffee bar by way of compensation stayed for one night when i went to a concert at the o  i think this was probably the most comfortable hotel bed i ve experienced and definitely the best pillows ever lovely shower too my room had a great view across the river and the covered walkway to the o  was very welcome it wasn t made clear via booking com that there was parking on site which there is and ample the staff were fantastic and the hotel was amazing rooms were just something else and the views from the restaurants and bars just brilliant not a single thing loved it all everything about this hotel is amazing the staff could not do enough to help got an amazing room with a lovely view an even chocolate cake for a birthday a walk way through to the o  love it can not wait to stay again as we are always coming up to the o  thank you very much made out weekend the service at breakfast wasn t that good we had to wait quite a while for our tea and coffee and even longer for the milk when it eventually arrived the tea and coffee was cold we watched a waitress wipe a table with her bare hand and then handle the cutlery which we didn t think was very hygenic considering the service wasn t that good we were not impressed with the     service charge the room was very comfortable with a lovely view room was very clean and well equipped the hotel was so convenient for the   prices in the sky bar   for a bottle of prosecco plus a service charge on top of that next door to and linked with the o  parking reasonable for location and easy access to and from hotelno negative perfect location as i was taking my daughter for a birthday treat to the   access to the arena was easily accessible from the hotel which was fabulous hotel was really comfortable the staff were extremely helpful especially graham the doorman who greeted us on arrival and was there to say goodbye hotel charge was     for twin room for  night breakfast was not included having to pay an extra     for parking i find this outrageously expensive especially as we hadn t even spent  hours there very disappointed in the cost not good value for money the room was very nice the location easy access into the   was perfect no negative the staff were very friendly and helpful i enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend this hotel to anyway looking to stay in london the location cant not be beaten i put in a request to the hotel and they were more then happy to help and made my staff very welcome great hotel great staff and couldn t ask for much better the price is crazy and the breakfast was  pounds per head not very much the hotel is in the middle of nowhere totally ghastly and expensive but you are stuck if you want to go to o  my friend was ill and could not come no refund from booking como i won t use you again sometimes you have to be more understanding the main doors to the rooms need the hinges oiling as they creak when opened and closed plus the door closers should be adjusted to prevent slamming found the noise of this in neighbouring rooms quite annoying the bath shower room was fantastic and the bed so comfy staff so polite and helpful great stay fantastic staff friendly genuine and professional huge comfy bed soft pillows great view delicious food tassimo coffee machine was a great touch we loved the bar on the top floor the london skyline panoramic views were the best i have seen the   is literally next door so this is the best hotel to link with a concert the skybar was nice but quite pricey great location for the o  arena the river view rooms have a nice outlook especially at night extensive breakfast range hotel is a   minute stroll from the north greenwich underground station so very easy to get to there s also a pub within   minutes walking distance of the hotel i can not fault this hotel we had no problems finding it and there was plenty of on site parking too i would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again the staff from the moment we got there were very helpful and polite the hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in we had no problems at all getting to our concert on time as the hotel is next door to the o  arena the rooms were superb and we had a lovely view of the o  and the docklands from our room the bed was so comfortable and the room was very spacious after the concert we sat in the bar on the  th floor and drank cocktails while looking out at the night view the service was excellent we then had room service and ordered a late dinner and the food was great and was delivered to our room in no time at all and was set up on a table in the morning we had breakfast and there was a large selection of food and even catered for vegetarians so my daughter was happy our stay was great and the hotel is amazing with friendly welcoming staff nothing major perhaps the route from the tube could be a bit more pedestrian friendly and the mini bar was on the pricey side but all in all these were insignificant and would not stop me from staying again and again from jennifer s courteous and professional welcome at check in to tamara s warm and friendly service in the clipper bar what a view everything about my stay was perfect the beautifully appointed rooms were extremely comfortable and quiet no negative the staff were lovely and extremely friendly my daughter and i felt very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our stay i would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend it to all my friends and family rather small room for what we paid but view made it worth it delicious full english breakfast an array of juices pots of tea smoothies fresh fruit on offer every pastry you could imagine from french croissant to fried bread no negative was met at the entrance and escorted to the checking in desk our bags were taken up to our rooms excellent service all round will certainly be staying again when booked specified it was for my  st birthday disappointed at lack of knowledge from staff or anything extra nice view of the river though partially blocked by l shape of building wish i could have stayed longer me and my boyfriend absolutely loved the intercontinental hotel i booked the superior king room after having read several positive reviews so my expectations were high and i was not disappointed it was our best hotel experience together from the moment of check in to check out never seen such polite friendly and welcoming staff before amazing customer service from the reception to the bar restaurant and the great spa facilities too it was his birthday so i requested for something special in the room and what a pleasant surprise we got the views the roses and even a free slice of cake which really made us feel special the bed is very comfortable the room impeccably clean everything is new and fresh very modern too we came back very relaxed and wanting to stay more what a hotel simply the best well done everyone i highly recommend it and will be spreading the word keep up the good work no negative large bed view from room and bars restaurants friendly staff high tech rooms lighting and speaker in bathroom our mini bar was emptied after requested i said it was my partners birthday and the hotel put a happy birthday cake in our room waiting for us when we arrived nice touch the spa was lovely brilliant hotel amazing in every way my only gripe is that the jacuzzi water was quite cold which put my mrs off but when we alerted the hotel staff they we re very apologetic and turned the temperature up no positiveno negative the staff were excellent from the moment we got to the front door til the time we left the choice at breakfast was unbelievable the rooms was very comfortable the whole thing was brilliant the bedroom coffee machine was rubbish a hotel of this standard should have a nespresso machine some of the breakfast buffet staff seemed quite disinterested and we had to wait quite a while over   mins for our coffees but this wouldn t put me off returning again go for it a large modern quality upscale yet friendly hotel at a reasonable price for london a visit to the skybar is a must the breakfast buffet is quite nice too excellent welcome check in bravo to the young irish gentleman standard rooms quite small but impeccable and well designed ours had a view over the river and the   skywalk five minutes walk from the tube line and surprisingly easy access from gatwick airport i would recommend this to anyone if i had to fault something it would be the pillows were a little thick but thats really just trying to find a fault the sky bar is absolutely beautiful coffee machine in my room with the awesome breakfast display no negative the overall cleanliness of the hotel was second to none as were the facilities and attention to detail throughout beautiful room and incredibly comfortable bed the leisure facilties were spotless would highly recommend the steam room room i booked i was told was an upgrade but it didn t feel like it wasn t given a proper view of river as requested breakfast was ok bed was very comfy my daughters birthday so staff made a cake we used the swimming pool and facilities in the morning having only two showers available was not enough as there were a number of women wanting to shower at the same time drainage very poor around the showers there too great rooms beds very luxurious loved the speakers in the bathroom so you could listen to the tv radio staff very friendly and happy to help you options for breakfast were brilliant something for everyone i couldn t fault anything being greeted by a happy member of staff before even entering the hotel helpful and friendly reception staff the cleanliness of the room and the amazing choice at breakfast marks and wear and tear on furniture in clipper bar and gents shower needed unblocking i mentioned this to a member of staff who said she would mention this to someone but i presumed they knew because whilst i was in shower a towel was sitting near door on floor presumably to soak water up so as it didn t flow into the next shower closeness to the o  our reason for coming to london my room was     and night and   ladies   rooms down paid   they stayed   night and we stayed for   for some room i thought i d upgrade mine but it was the the same room and view but they did say they would move me in second night but we said it was to much hassle to pack and unpack again pool was lovely and bed was so nice and soft cover liked everything it was perfect for us to attend a concert at the o  we didn t even have to step outside as they have a corridor straight into the arena the room was beautiful the beds big and super comfortable we will definitely stay again on our next visit only a slight detail due to   a night parking fee i was lucky i only had to pay   but if i d stayed longer obviously it would have been more the comfort and hospitality at the hotel was outstanding also the spa facilities made you feel so relaxed couldn t find the stairs beyond the  nd floor no signs so had to find a staff member there were lots of other guests with same problem as the lifts were full good job it wasn t an emergency situation very friendly staff clean and luxurious the room got a bit stuffy and there wasn t a window to open we couldn t feel the effects of the air con great location we attended a concert at the o  arena and chose this hotel based on its close proximity and it didn t disappoint good choice of restaurants and bars nearby plus the underground being a ten minute walk away hotel was clean and well presented pleasant view from the hotel window tv didn t work correctly even though they tried to get someone to fix it direct access to o  from the hotel incredibly comfortable bed stunning  th floor bar great choice at the breakfast buffet but was not replenished quickly enough this was probably due to the hotel being incredibly busy the staff were incredibly helpful and polite the room was tastefully furnished with great views of canary wharf nothing everything was perfect everything was perfect staff were brilliant and really friendly the hotel room was out of this world we really enjoyed staying here and will defiantly be coming back again i have been charged extra for using my debit card but i have to wait a week to get refunded not happy with this the bed was really comfortable staff amazingly helpfulno negative the staff were so friendly and helpful when i checked in i was told that my room had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise beautiful room with such a comfy bed no negative proximity to the o  was incredible staff were very friendly swimming pool was incredible bed was unbelievably comfortable all in all one of the best stays at a hotel we ve ever had would definitely recommend dreadful pre concert   course meal would never have that again service was very poor huge queues for breakfast the next day went back to our room for nearly an hour but the breakfast was lovely when we eventually got it lovely room with view overlooking the thames great pillows staff very helpful perfect venue for the o  it took me more than an hour to check in just because of my name was mistakenly recorded and the receptionist female blacks hair tie high kept that from me all the time without any apologies you know that after a long flight my almost   year old son was very exhausted and sleepy the attitude of the black receptionist was so bad that i doubted whether this was a five star hotel and i swore that i would never book this hotel and told all my friends the view looking from the window is great only   cup per person so if you had a tea later a coffee you had to wash the cup in the bathroom not ideal room was too warm at night could not get temperature under   this woke us both on the night as the room was stuffy great facilities in the rooms everything was thought of great cocktails in the clipper bar i know i left my high speed charger in the room i called three times for someone to get back to me the third person did however it was gone spa not very theraputic as kids were splashing and screaming in the pool very comfy beds warm welcome and helpful staff happy and friendly staff concierge cleaners and reception spa modern clean steam sauna and pool best location for o  and surroundings food excellent the private hotel access to the o  it works going to the o  but not in reverse as the o  shut the access door to the hotel link far too early and you cant get back leaving a very long walk round very courteous and helpful doorman standard of food and restaurant service very high price of food and drink fruit was poor in room pillows awful wasn t very equipped for children superb views of the   bit expensive to eat and drink lovely hotel tho have no complaints at all for the price it s unfortunately not going to be a regular thing but if you ve got the money spare or want to treat yourself i can thing of nowhere better near this location stayed for the brook fight at the o  and thought we d treat ourselves and got luxury for the whole stay large new clean stylish room   bars situated all throughout the hotel busy but quick service literally a   minute walk to the o  arena through a pathway from the reception and staff always happy to help may even catch a few celebrities boxers there if there s an event on at the o  be aware the o  close some of their exits from the venue once the show has started turns a   min walk back to h tel into   mins my mum was disabled and really struggled and the o  weren t willing to help no positive location great for the   but not if you also want to go into central london as     tube changes breakfast very expensive though good food as no opening windows need to be able to alter the air con temp which we couldn t no positive price of breakfast i enjoyed it and selection was good but   inc sc for a buffet is a bit high in my opinion i also think charging for service when you basically serve yourself is a bit cheeky this place was a dream particularly liked the tassimo machine in the room best nights sleep i think i ve had in a hotel little touches here and there gave it the luxury feel we would have liked to go into the   floor bar for a drink after watching a show in the o  but was full also we found breakfast to be expensive for what we had so a bit disappointed we were made to feel very welcome and the room was very comfortable we slept well we thought the hotel is a great place to stay as we were going to the   to watch a show the breakfast we had inclusive breakfast with the room our tea coffee order was incorrect and we were presented with a bill for someone else s room the food was not cooked well and of inferior quality bed and room view paid for a river view were amazing staff welcoming and attentive facilities cleanliness and location are faultless not enough staff in market brasserie busy but not full and staff overwhelmed had to cancel main course as no time to eat before concert would ve expected extra staff numbers to be on duty at busy times staff were polite though waited over hour and had to request drinks etc bed and linen very comfy and high quality all room facilities excellent staff willing and happy walkway from north greenwich tube is partially gravel needs to be properly paved but i am sure it s a work in progress given how new the hotel is amazing hotel right next to the o  amazing staff amazing bar on  th floor super comfy beds great views great in room dining service was dire the hotel can t cope with a full compliment of guests totally disorganised staff were polite and apologetic but waiting times were long we were waiting   mins to get served in the restaurant and we told them when booking we needed a reasonable turnaround we had to leave in the end without eating or we would have missed the show they should be more honest when taking your table booking we would have been happy to eat elsewhere and would have left with a better impression of the hotel many of the guests were complaining some had been waiting   mins and still nothing on the table convenient for o  early evening service in the brasserie was dismal and chaotic service in the millenium bar after  pm show finish almost non existent great views comfortable room nothing absolutely amazing service attention to detail terrific staff went out of their way for us we couldn t get a taxi and the wonderful concierge got the hotel car and drove us to the bus stop nothing was too much trouble i have nothing but praise for this hotel breakfast was fantastic didn t have the breakfast as i thought it expensive but sure it would have been prepared as everything else very well if you don t mind the cost location to o  everything about the room staff very friendly and helpful we were unable to get access to the skyline bar on the  th floor after the concert due to crowding and the service is the downstairs bars was not great long waits the bed was extremely comfortable and the choices for breakfast outstanding the staff were extremely customer focused and our room had outstanding views it was very well placed for the   way too few bar staff in the eighteen bar only two staff making drinks needed at least double that for an hour or so we had an inordinate wait to get a drink top class room and general facilities pleasant and helpful staff this is an expensive hotel with high standard furnishings facilities etc what a pity then that the service could be so much better once you managed to get someone to serve you they were excellent but getting someone to come to you is the problem not enough staff in relation to guests at breakfast customers were made to wait while tables were cleared despite the fact that the tables had been vacated some considerable time earlier finally when checking in they promote the skybar on floor   we attempted to do this after the show we had been to waited for a lift as they were very busy only to be told the skybar was full when we reached the  th floor customers should have been alerted in reception area not good customer service the rooms furnishings all excellent breakfast selection amazing hotel was full due to concert at   and it worked ok for us as we didn t mind having a drink after concert rather than queuing for hotel lift some people just like to complain we heard them we on the other hand loved our stax and would definitely stay again amazing spa comfortable room stunning views from room and bar breakfast had a great range of choices fantastic choice after a night at o  felt very smug being able to walk home very busy expect full as a major star was performing at the o  which we attended queue to check in and for breakfast in the morning not ideal for a   star but small gripe excellent staff spa area beautiful lovely quiet bedrooms and being linked into the   perfect the sky bar was full which wasn t a problem as they said it is first come first served however they could have told the queue of people waiting by the lifts downstairs so they didn t waste their time and then the barman in the clipper bar tried to serve someone who arrived after me despite me telling him i was there first in the end he served us both but the queue jumper got his drinks first and then paid first i say barman he was wearing a suit and looked more like a manager very rude and not what i expect from such an expensive bar it wouldn t have been so bad if we weren t left waiting so long to be served previous to this as they didn t have enough staff to cope with the post concert rush other than the minor pain in the bar everything else was great the location is great everything was almost impeccably tidy great staff and great rooms as a lot of guests were staying because of the concert at o  having so few staff serving in the bars afterward was short sighted we waited   minutes in the merdian bar and still had not been able to order the same for many other guests then we then left and went to the sky bar and were not even allowed in as we were told it was full we then went to the clipper bar and got served after about   minutes but had to stand and whilst i do not like to complain that is unreasonable in a   star hotel at the prices you charge and my girlfriend is   months pregnant i don t even have to wait that long in a premier inn a lot of other people also got fed up and left without being served so it isn t just us that were fed up at being ignored really nice room and friendly staff mostly nothing we stayed at this hotel as we were going to a show at the o  perfect as the venue was only a short walk away about   min and there was a covered walkway from the hotel to the o  staff were exceptional and were always smiling nothing was too much trouble will stay again without a doubt sounds silly but not enough milk and tea facilities in the room after a long journey to london a nice cuppa before unpacking and venturing out again would have been lovely but we felt we had to save the milk for a cup of tea in the morning everything about our stay was fantastic from being greeted at the door super friendly staff to the slippers and bathrobes in the room wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying again in fact we are already planning our next london trip the brasserie restaurant was appalling the worst service i have ever experienced in a hotel like this i walked out without paying that s how bad it was very annoyed location no negative thank you so much for leaving the birthday cake in the room for my boyfriends  st it made it much more personal and special the bed was super super comfy and the room was clean the view was so amazing and the spa was lovely and quiet everything about this trip was incredible there was nothing to dislike it was perfect for us to be able to attend the andrea bocelli concert in the   arena as its right next door with easy access to the   through a connecting walkway expensive car park for the type of hotel car park should be accommodated for rather than paying more poor room view was told i would have a nice view but got a view of a roof no positive view could of been better but if you want a good view it does say you need to pay more which was probably worth it but could still see a lot from our room only other problem is finding the entrance first time it is a bit of a walk but walking through the o  is great plenty of places to eat near by if you don t fancy the menu at the hotel just walk through the o  to see them all tube system is literally a   minute walk away and the emirates air rail is   minutes away both great for getting around and seeing sites throughout london the beds are very comfortable and the rooms look prestige bathroom looks amazing too upon entrance to the hotel you re greeted very politely and even walked over to the check in desk where the staff are fantastic and tell you all about the local area and explain everything clearly the entrance lobby looks fantastic too the walk from tube to hotel is disrupted by building work and the path is gravel in places not great with a wheeled suitcase it s only   or   minutes depending on which exit from the tube but its a shame as everything else was fabulous fabulous room very nice bar a little bit expensive on just a bite to eat extremely comfy beds amazing soft bedding loved the duvet and the pillows all staff was heavenly professional and at your service at any time views to die for you can see londons skyline from everywhere the rooftop bar is fab no negative the beds were amazing so comfortable was difficult to get up for breakfast in the morning the staff were excellent and the convenience of being a   minute walk from the o  was fantastic that l only booked a   night stay very wide range of food available for breakfast and well cooked too the bed was amazingly comfortable and the staff were so polite helpful and well spoken and informative only quibble the cost of the breakfast   per head plus     service charge for a meal that i got up and got myself as was buffet style not sure who the service charge went to brilliant hotel fantastic amenities comfy bed and great shower staff were polite and friendly and had perfect access to o  the price of the kitkat in the room fridge     very friendly and efficient staff clean and comfortable room the sky bar was a wonderfully relaxed place for a nightcap albeit a bit pricey there is basic free internet but you have to pay extra for decent speeds i think given the price they could give you good free internet breakfast was incredible spa and pool were wonderful and the staff incredibly lovely and politeno negative bed was lovely and comfortable we had an amazing view from the  th floor the location was brilliant as we went to a show at the o  arena we had our   year old son with us and the staff were brilliant and very friendly would definitely go back again going the room a bit warm probably my fault didn t know how to sort temperature could have asked i suppose but little info sheet would be handy couldn t find anything in drawers view from room amazing had a lovely swim with grandson in pool breakfast outstanding n beds like sleeping on clouds bathroom wish it were mine beautiful n roomy too the price of drinks at the bar were ridiculously expensive the hotel was lovely food was fantastic bed was the most comfortable hotel bed i ve ever slept in during the night in one of the rooms nearby there was a lot of noise well past   in the morning nothing was done about this which did disturb our sleep immensely the facilities in both the hotel and room were second to none and the views from our room and  th floor bar were amazing as we were seeing a show in the o  it was the perfect location for us coffee machine in the room leaked but it was quickly rectified by a member of staff the staff we re all very friendly and efficient breakfast was excellent the gentleman that welcomed us at the door was very very helpful no negative omg it was an amazing place to be from the entrance view to the rooms resturant and bar the staff where amazing especially the concierge the spa was good am diffnately coming back one of my towels was dirty no complimentary biscuits to have with tea in the morning extremely comfortable beds luxurious rooms very helpful staff i had included breakfast in our stay on booking com and even upgraded our stay to ensure this however on going down to breakfast we were advised this was not included and i would need to pay   per person when i checked my confirmation email there was nothing to confirm i had selected this option i am   sure however i had selected this on booking com as there was the green icon breakfast included and when i pressed book it had another breakfast included icon to confirm again i found this really embarrassing on checking out we were charged   full english breakfasts   each where i only had the continental i had confirmed this with the waiters at the time and advised i only had a bowl of porridge the staff on checkout were not too helpful and tried to advise breakfast included means you still have to pay they seemed very put out and made many phone calls in clarifying what i had that morning they finally charged me for my continental however this was   which is a very expensive bowl of porridge i ve lost my trust in booking com as it cost me a lot more than i had budgeted and there was nothing to defend me i didn t find the member of staff on checkout helpful in this matter food was exceptional and our room was lovely the hotel is quiet at night ensuring a good nights sleep the free wifi in the room was too slow to be use even for simple email business center was very disappointing not a good option for work unless you pay extra no positive a lift to and from the station would have been very welcome due to the building work the walk with a youngster and a suitcase to such an accommodation property would have made our stay perfect and truly value for money fantastic location staff were so helpful and informative room was so comfy with everything we could need breakfast was a real treat i didn t have sky sports in the room not a major issues but after a day of travel me my wife son where tired and wanted to head back to the room there was big premier league game on and i couldn t watch it and none of the bars in the hotel seemed to have a tv but as i said it was only a minor grip and did not impact on the rest of a very enjoyable stay in a top hotel excellent location for the o  staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for you darragh on check in was particularly helpful would highly recommended this hotel if you are taking in a show or event in the o  no negative check in was very well conducted and quick with everything explained and any questions answered efficiently rooms were very well presented and all was as advertised well worth the expense to stay on site at the o  trip hazard going from room to bathroom reported this on check out some windows at the approach to the hotel were cracked the walk from and to the tube station was not the safest due to what looks like unfinished paths maybe a shuttle bus would be an improvement the cost of items in the mini bar     for a kitkat calling the hotel when using the automated service to speak to the right person no one answers the phone friendly staff good selection at breakfast a nice surprise in our room due to a celebration it was odd watching tv and the sound going into the bathroom would have been nice to turn the speaker off a beautiful hotel with friendly staff and luxurious bed and plenty to do no negative i loved how close the hotel was to the o  as i went to see miranda sings it was also perfectly located near to the station i would definitely stay here again view from the room found a hair on robe when we arrived we was made to pay   incase of any problems with room an also when we went to breakfast they didn t know if we had paid for it or not location spa facilities coffee machine in room bath and shower comfy bed the prices were very high in the bar for drinks as well as the breakfast which was   for   or   each this priced us out the breakfast which was not ideal as we did not want to pay that figure the mini bar in the room and its contents were expensive so we did not partake in these particularly for a can of coke or   finger kitkat so that was a bit frustrating a small  ml bottle of wine chardonnay was   from the minibar which equates to about   medium glasses so     a glass overall good price for the room of   but some of the extras were expensive the facilities and room were extremely good clean and no expense spared on any of the fixtures and fittings the sky bar was very impressive on the  th floor with the views of the river thames and city skyline no negative room very spacious and bed was one of the best i have ever slept in attending an event at the o  so perfect location andrei was superb on reception great attitude and very friendly location is great for weekends but a hassle to get to the city or even to city airport because of blackwell tunnel a shuttle to north greenwich tube station would be good a shuttle ferry connecting to the north bank of the river even better new clean and comfy spectacular views pool closed at night door to o  was not open when it should according to the schedule very modern nice views close to subway hassle free proceduresno negative lovely clean hotel enough staff around to tend to your needs breakfast was fabulous so much choice in again a big clean restaurant and plenty of staff available choice of bedding even though feather down quilts and pillows are very luxurious it s too rustly for me and keeps me awake biscuits in the room would be nice with the tea coffee facilities stayed here a few times now and love everything about this hotel the staff have really stepped upto the mark since first opening where we experienced a few teething problems very friendly and know what their doing a beautiful hotel walkway to the   can t fault it the price of the room service menu was extortionate   burgers   chips   very very small cokes and   peroni was   food was good but much too expensive the room was immaculate and beautiful staff were helpful and friendly the bars within hotel were very inviting no negative attending an   event staff gave us an early check in and were extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with beautiful hotel would definitely stay againno negative we were given a corner room with a fantastic view over the river bed was very comfy and shower was nice and hot the use of the covered walkway in and out of the o  is perfect made several confirmations about my booking as i was booking for someone to stay but on the day they could not find booking and took a long time to rectify the problem received complementary extras to celebrate birthday nothing the attention to detail in all respects was very impressive with service and servility to match the location which we were unsure about turned out to be ideal as within metres tube bus or taxi s were available we travelled by car but left it in the car park it was a pleasure to be without it well done intercontinental no negative the bed was amazing and the room was well worth the money loved the surprise cake for my partner that was put in the room prior to us arriving can t fault this hotel the cost of the breakfast we did not have breakfast in the hotel we loved the amazing views from our room as well as the food and the friendliness and efficiency of all of the staff from the doorman to the barman it was my husbands  th and we had birthday cake left in the room as well as some that was bought to us after dinner which we thought was a lovely touch overall we were very pleased and the found the rates to be good value the jacuzzi was broken in the spa the dessert menu for room service could be more extensive the huge bed was super comfortable the staff were absolutely amazing so friendly and couldn t do enough for us the views were great at night time and we loved the coffee machine in our room they are doing some construction outside hotel not to do with hotel mind but you couldn t hear it did mean walking round a bit more but it didn t bother us we booked a river view room that was fantastic loved the swimming pool spa afternoon tea was amazing staff were lovely would definitely recommend this hotel so good being near all the o  restaurants bars no negative great location for the o  really comfortable bedrooms especially the beds staff are fantastic breakfast was incredible and vast will definitely stay again no negative the beds were incredible the overall level of service comfort and willingness of the staff was exceptional particularly enjoyed the quality of the breakfast buffet and the view from the sky bar path along the thames from hotel to greenwich was closed diverted due to all building development work taking place along the river on that part of the peninsula breakfast was overpriced lacked value for money unaffordable we were not told about the link between hotel and o  by staff on checking in lack of attention paid by staff in spa parts were dirty towels left lying around no water available by steam sauna batteries in weigh scales needs changing jacuzzi jets not working resented having to pay     per   hours for the hotel car park when it was empty and more importantly the barriers were up not working on exit every opportunity to make money is used and abused view over thames from our bed was awesome lighting in room was well thought out real coffee machine was a bonus toiletries provided were extensive the walk from north greenwich station still seems like it is under construction not good on a rainy day but i m sure once the path is properly laid it will improve staff were lovely and welcoming rooms were so comfortable and had everything you need and more i wish i could have stayed longer and will definitely book again nothing negative to be honest staff were nice gave all the information i needed room was nice a little smaller than i had imagined but it was nice view could of been better but overall it was nice also offered me complimentary late chech out but i ended up not using it because of work hours but it was lovely and relaxing no negative the room had the most amazing view of london also the staff went the extra mile to make my boyfriends birthday special by bringing him a surprise cake the jacuzzi was broken so no bubbles the sausages bacon at breakfast were under cooked the view from our rooms were of a flat roof this time where as before we ve had amazing views of the thames really comfy bed amazing views friendly staff great swimming pool spa the view at night from the sky bar is magical no negative all the staff were very helpful pleasant made our stay very memorable will definitely be going again soon good location excellent all the way round spa treatments were fully booked on the weekend we stayed cost is very high   for breakfast your best bet is to walk   minutes to all bar one at the o  and enjoy breakfast for under a tenner amazingly clean well done to the cleaners and maids staff on the whole were so friendly the rooms got a little hot but after a while the aircon kicked in also no windows balcony reception staff was brilliant the rooms were spotless drinks can be expensive but it s london prices and i paid the same for a drink at the theatre there is a tesco nearby if you want cheap supplies everything was brilliant the spa was great the sky bar was as promised having the o  on your doorstep opened up extra dining and tourist options being close to the tube meant you are not far away from the action the room was huge and had the softest bed i ve ever slept in room had a proper coffee machine and the bathroom was lovely with a huge shower can t fault the place i couldn t find the hotel using my sat nav if i typed the postcode i ended up somewhere else close by but no outside the hotel took us a while to find the hotel came to spend the night here for my partners birthday i had contacted the hotel prior to our stay to see if they could decorate the room upon arrival which they did they sent a beautiful complimentary birthday cake to the room and decorated the bed with rose petals and a helium birthday balloon it was so amazing and really made my partner s day special also breakfast was served to is in our bedroom in the morning and i cant even find words to explain how amazing breakfast was how it was all laid out on a table with everything we asked service was amazing they helped with our luggage checking in and checking out couldn t have asked for a better stay there was no toothpaste or toothbrush and i had to ask for vallet parking but staff was very helpful the view was great the staff were very haplfull after negotiations we finally got a room on the top floor facing canary warf this hotel is all about the view which you don t have on the  th floor we re still not sure why this was so difficult to organize as we had requested it and at our stay it was incredible quiet but we were very pleased that they finally accommodated us its a   mins ride into town with the subway very convenient great value for money as the hotel is quiet when there is no major event in the o  the rooms are clean and the beds comfortable with large windows to enjoy the view view from the room was of air conditioning units on the flat roof right outside the window avoid the third floor if this is important otherwise great comfy bed good tv nice bathroom the only problem we had was we went to an event at the o  that finished at   in the morning there s a walk way that connects the hotel to the o  but it shut at   had a long walk back to the hotel was a lovely hotel very warm welcome on arrival and staff were very helpful would definitely go back rough start ending up in a building site looking for reception coming from north greenwich tube st use tha last entrance pool gym views high standard breakfast the bed was like sleeping on a board in fact the floor felt softer if you like a little comfort and give in your mattress then don t stay here i booked this hotel for the location and i wasn t disappointed it was also lovely inside and i had a good river view   hygiene problem we found mold in our breakfast jam jar after the incident we tried to cancel our breakfast for the next coming days but they refused to and said they will consider it not until we rreported to ihg in regards to this issue then the hotel agreed to refund the breakfast   broken glass in the hallway outside our room for two days we saw the broken glass and expected someone to clean it up but no one had it cleaned until we reported to the reception to avoid any severe injuries   housekeeping was not trained well the doors were not closed properly after service many times and room supplies was not properly filled everyday we had to remind them to bring certain things that they forgot to put in our room everyday not to mention the organization of the room regarding the bed sheets things on the table were not properly placed   guest relations they did not solve any problems of which we complained about until we reached ihg during check out i had to argue with the guest relation staff member about the cancelled breakfast that i had confirmed days ago service and attitude was disappointing throughout my entire stay the only service that satisfied me was the doorman he was the only member of staff that didn t make me feel disrespected n a excellent very modern hotel nice room with a very comfy bed it has the convenience of having an easy access to the o  if you are heading to any kind of show there spa facilities great and staff also vey friendly and helpful if i could find a problem which would be hard i would have to say the surrounding area seemed very deralic i thought the staff were simply amazing always very polite and willing to help     the other guests were so rude the hotel is too expensive for being so cut off from london better stay across the river restaurants were under staffed heating was uncontrollable the spa is nice good options for dining nice flavours sky bar drinks very very pricey   kopperberg   view was amazing though i only have one word for this hotel outstanding the rooms were beautiful and so clean and the service was suberb beautifully located and the facilities were amazing our room had thames view which was lovely defiantly be back again the breakfast was okay not the best that i have had at a hotel we arrived at the hotel and was checked in quickly by one of the lovely staff our room was on the  th floor and we had an amazing view of river thames and the o  we returned from the event at the o  and ordered room service and the steak and chunky fries was so delicious the bed is one of the most comfortable beds that i ve slept on breakfast a pretty expensive for the quality of the cooking and nearest other option would have been a tube ride over to canary wharf away likewise room service   for a plate of cheese went for the     slightly floppy pizza instead big bed massive   metre pool decent steam room great check in staff plenty of parking and very near the tube electronic card entry failed to work this is always very irritating when you arrive somewhere and all you want to do is get to your room problem fixed very quickly so staff were great but this is an avoidable problem excellent helpful staff and took care of my bike which was very important to me the smoking area in the sky bar has wide gaps between the paving slabs i m told for drainage purposes my heel fell down the crack and scraped all of the fabric off my brand new shoes that if only worn for the very first time i was so disappointed a hotel of this standard should not have faults like that amazing room with comfy bed and black out curtains had the best sleep sky bar amazing but very expensive staff very professional and polite overpriced for what it was zero information given at check in no breakfast included milk was off in the tea facilities bed was super comfy and the bathroom was very nice could be difficult to find without a satnav as there are very little signs around the o  arena but that is really nit picking for faults very clean massive room and great view of the o  arena and the docks in the background from the  th floor staff were very friendly and the onsite parking was very secure and cheaper than others in the area even though there was a festival happening next to the hotel we couldn t hear any of it at night which was great no negative fantastic hotel and service used the hotel for cycling event next day and the hotel went above and beyond with the facilities laid on for the cyclists didn t like the hot tub jacuzzi didn t work but didn t spoil a great experience all round gorgeous room top quality felt brand new so good the cost for breakfast whether   star or   star an egg is and egg bacon is bacon tea and coffee are hot flavoured drinks and none of these items cost much to buy regardless of the quality to charge  ph per night for breakfast is insane i can make an amazing eggs benedict for  ph or smoked salmon and scrambled eggs for  ph no breakfast is worth more than     max ph sorry but it s just not we re a couple who might get for breakfast or might not but   would certainly dictate that decision please reconsider your ott breakfast pricing outstanding location with lots to see and do nearby the hotel itself was impeccable the staff were top quality where nothing was any trouble and the facilities inside the hotel are fantastic spa pool bars and restaurants ate at the hotel a few times and the food was amazing rooms lovely decor perfect the little touches throughout and staff going that extra mile with no hassle at all make all the difference i really can t speak highly enough of this hotel thank you to all the staff who made our stay perfect no negative unfortunately we didn t get her name but the lady at reception was extremely great at her job was very friendly helpful and professional she knew it was my girlfriends birthday and when we got back from a trip to central london there was a chocolate cake in our room very nice touch for her to arrange this amazingno negative the service was second to none from the welcome at the door to the team checking you in who also reffered to me by name the following day its the little things also the view on the  th floor bar incredible went up to the roof top bar to find a beautiful room with great views however a female member of staff came across very unprofessional and i was quite shocked wth the way my partner and i were treated all other staff and venue i rate    no positive the cost for food in room and restaurants were very expensive parking in hotel car park was very expensive so we parked elsewhere and walked   mins and saved   they set up a cot for our   month daughter in our room which is were so pleased for staff were very friendly and always smiling service was fantastic the high cost of drinks definitely put us off having more than   drink so left the hotel earlier than we would ve liked to the hotel grabs your attention from the outset with its modern classy look staff were helpful and the direct tunnel to the o  arena is fantastic would definitely recommend and would stay here again everything was great but parking a little expensive the bed was very comfy there was a great choice choice for breakfast all staff were came across were really friendly was told we would get a complementary upgrade to the club lounge but it was subsequently and mysteriously withdrawn initially they reported that it was never offered later they stated that the receptionist made a misstatement it kind of left a bitter taste in an otherwise pleasant stay very friendly staff except for the initial experience described above vaides the concierge was especially helpful the food and breakfast are very expensive because it s gourmet you can at in the nearby o  arena outlets new clean comfortable and great location for o  and excel beautiful pool and spa time taken to remake room cooling from a c a bit of challenge cld indulge guests a bit more with d little things considering it s actually rated as   star rather than put a charge on em every turn not like guests can t afford em any ways but it d b nice courteous polite staff comfy bed thorough access to o  centre the air con in our room wasn t hugely effective the hotel wasn t well sign posted from the tube station the bar has a lovely atmosphere there was an amazing patisserie selection in the bar perfect to go with a glass of bubbly the lobby was beautiful the hotel was stylish gym was really well equipped having to go home after only one night stay staff amazing food was beautifully presented and well priced perfect location for o  loved  th floor bar and cocktails amazing absolutely nothing what an absolutely stunning hotel clean modern and excellent staff the room with a double view was stunning the bed was so comfortable could not fault the room or the hotel cant wait to go back nothing the best hotel we ever stayed in the staff were knowledgable about the food and wine very friendly and very chatty checking in was super easy and reception staff were lovely fabulous spa and gym facilities so close to the o no negative excellent service room was spacious clean and very comfortable staff were so friendly and helpful excellent location for o  breakfast was exceptional breakfast is a little expensive lovely room with modern bathroom shower large comfy bed with lovely soft pillows had a lovely view of the thames and the big bonus is being next door to the o  staff very helpful and courteous drink prices are very high they ran out of lager on wednesday afternoon and still had non at lunch time on thursday drinks in the restaurant were served by a young waitress from a tray with glasses she d collected from another table the food and beverages department lacks a lot of   star polish the location for the o  is perfect and the hotel is very bright modern and clean very expensive food and drink very disorganised breakfast most of the staff and non native english speakers and could not make themselves be understood very well no draught beer the shower head was scaled and the complimentary shower gel had obviously been opened and used automatic     on all room charges without any chance to leave them off even when the service was not too good the great location for the o  and getting into london a   minute walk along the thames to greenwich parking on site it is quite windy at the location i wanted to sit out smoke and have a drink but the staff wouldnt accomodate this also we came back from the concert sat in the clipper bar they werent serving food but we did ask if we could order form room service and eat in bar and they wouldnt allow this there needs to be a little more flexibility with customers very good hotel we went to see a concert at the o  arena it made it hassle free in fact you walk out of the o  arena via a different route and do not have to queue too much to get out room and service was fantastic the breakfast offered very good choice slightly confused on how to get out of the car park as the ticket paid for wouldn t allow us to exit extra comfy beds great location and a bar over the skyline which was open until   am i didn t like that they tried to charge me extra for an upgrade i didn t ask for or was even given the option of and then was told it was my misunderstanding other than this a great hotel but has put me off staying again no positive nothing excellent efficiency and friendliness of staff very clean and luxurious modern feel sky bar very chic but pricey then again you get what you pay for great part of city to stay away from the busy central locations but all within easy access via the delightful river boat i am not happy about the fact that on checking in i was asked to pay   deposit which was taken off my debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar i think this should have been made clear in the booking confirmation to prepare the customers and this shouldn t be compulsory the staff told me it was compulsory that i had to make the deposit what happened to freedom of choice not everyone would want to use the mini bar i ended up paying   for two nights including the extra charge which i didn t plan for i only planned on paying   what would have happened if the customer didn t have the extra deposit money this is a very beautiful hotel i loved it so much that i had to extend my stay the restaurants are beautiful and well set up only complaint is that the spa short changed my partner bev i booked her a   minute espa massage and she only received   minutes and was too embarrassed to say anything bit disappointing given the cost great location great hotel exactly why im an ihg gold member great concierge check in and luggage staff nothing excellent breakfast perfect location for the o  arena very good quality bed and bedding beautiful swimming pool with robes towels and flip flops couldn t go into the sky lounge as it had reached its full capacity at midnight disappointed as we were only there for the one night excellent location friendly helpful staff price for parking was ridiculous i was there for  hrs   mins and it cost something like   should be a service to the local underground station clean and comfy room with excellent location for the o  food was nice too with good service from staff hard to find fault with this hotel i m disappointed we didn t get to experience the bar on the top floor late at night but it was packed after everyone returning from the o  looked amazing though on price it s definitely a treat for someone with my budget but on this experience you clearly get what you pay for from the moment we arrived the experience was first rate leo i think offered a warm welcome and went that little step further than than usual check in you d expect the room was modern comfortable and spacious we didn t get to use all the facilities but the general assessment was of the highest quality throughout the staff were brilliant breakfast was like nothing i ve had in other hotels and everything in the hotel was immaculate we were visiting the o  for a lionel ritchie concert so location was perfect being literally next door no negative great service from the staff all of them very friendly extra mention to diana in reception very friendly and helpful ideal location for visiting the o  arena couldn t work out the coffee machine and that i had to leave to go to work service overall experience seafood platter in the bar location to o  views my wife had difficulty walking and by the time we managed to get back to the hotel we were not available to get a table in the sky bar very disappointing hot water was poor in the room st     hours location is excellent for the o  staff very friendly and helpful very badly trained staff generally a shambles leaving aside all else that failed i gave up after   hours at     hrs as i could not get coffee pods for the machine delivered to the room it was merely the icing on a disastrous cake and at what a price proximity to   odd smell in the room view of flat roof not appealing waited for ages to be served in the sky bar only fruit tea available and one cup coffee per person in the room handy location for o  concierge was excellent if everything was a little cheaper i guess you get what you pay for though super comfy bed fabulous views sky bar amazing staff exceptional location perfect for o  having to leave really comfy bed excellent location for   friendly staff nothing was a problem fresh supply of fruits fresh fruit juice and choice for breakfast oh the skyline bar is a must fantastic sky bar very slow could have been staffed more even though staff that were there were great a lovely hotel excellent location for the   staff friendly food great out whole experience was worth every penny much too expensive parking was     overnight after spending that much money on a room parking was just too expensive plus the cost of the minibar where a kit kat was     also leaving     deposit made it very very expensive cos you don t get the money back for     days location was the best thing nothing it was just perfect oh and that our visit was too short staff were so helpful henry the night manager who assisted with me taking some stunning photographic images of the london skyline at    am the helpful spanish limo driver who helped out when our taxi failed to show and the welcoming brazillian waitress from the skybar whose first day was going well all the other staff smiled and bade us good morning too staff in the meridian cafe on site were lovely friendly attentive and professional by contrast staff serving at breakfast time in the market brasserie were somewhat sullen and the level of service was nowhere near as good we requested an extra pot of coffee and were met almost with disbelief it then took   minutes to arrive and it wasn t busy at the time staff were also slow to clear away used plates i did manage to get a smile out of one waiter on our second day but that was a rarity at breakfast time a fabulous hotel reception staff were welcoming and professional our room was lovely with amazing views excellent air con system and great bathroom with separate bath and shower food was good and the covered walkway to the o  is really useful location couldn t have been better as we were there for an o  event the hotel is also right next to the thames path which provides a nice flat walk down to greenwich or in the other direction as a new hotel address it s difficult to find breakfast too expensive for us so we passed and ate out in blackheath nb we realise breakfast charge is usual compare told to other hotels design quality customer service nothing to do with hotel but after concert you have to queue with people going onto tube to get back to hotel brand new hotel location is perfect for the o  arena also for getting into london on the boat taxis would use again had to send food back in restaurant but dealt with well shower floods bathroom as water does not go away toilet pressure when you flush was so high that eveytime you flush you get water all over the toilet seat just teething problems in a new build staff were excellent location good i would return great view from room stayed in room   on the  nd and  rd july   the bar eigteen was perfect in location and view of the o  arena and thames but the staff waiting could not cope with serving lots of people one girl was abrupt and rude when asked to be served to top it off the seats situated near the window areas were reserved which we were not informed of that this could be carried out breakfast was lovely lots of choice but the massive que to get seated and served was not nice which all hotels i have stayed in never had this problem hotel location was perfect especially with direct access into the o  arena the mature front doorman was a credit to the hotel went out of his way to ensure we were dropped to the local tube station in style no negative fabulous one night stay convenient for the o  room with a view was incredible bed soooo comfortable the staff were helpful and cheerful breakfast was one of the best we had ever had in a london hotel i honestly cannot fault this hotel when we arrived back that evening there was a   minute queue for a lift and we couldn t find the stairs despite wondering around it was incredibly frustrating not to have staff manning the situation breakfast was a nightmare we queued   minutes to be seated then had to keep asking for things as they were so busy the staff couldn t keep on top of it a gentle reminder at reception when checking in notifying us of busy periods would have been very useful the bed was very comfortable and the curtains were black out which made it easy to sleep in good that breakfast was until  am the staff were very friendly and they even gave us a little birthday cake for my husbands birthday to the room very thoughtful the hotel is new and still has some building work ongoing the sky bar on the  th floor was not available when i visited over the two nights i was there which was not explained to me very expensive bar prices in clipper bar     a pint is extreme even for london the location for going to an event at the   arena is perfect breakfast was better than most hotels i have stayed in very easy to get into central london using the thames clipper nothing everything wonderful from the moment we arrived staff couldn t do enough and very friendly room excellent home from home furnishings comfy bed relaxed atmosphere food great brilliant access into   arena parking a bonus we can t fault our stay it was excellent the hotel was clean modern and the views were fantastic the staff were extremely helpful professional and could not have done more for us the food was outstanding and there was so much variety we would definitely stay here again pillows could have been slightly firmer but that s nit picking everything was top quality an amazing hotel we will always remember as i proposed to my girlfriend in your amazing sky bar overlooking the city nothing not to like really only the service charges i thought wasn t really worth it fantastic location absolutely amazing for the   arena really quality property will definitely go back long time to wait for coffee at breakfast having to ask several times also i asked a member of restaurant staff for gluten free bread and i never got any excellent location lovely ambience friendly and efficient staff overall a very pleasant experience on arrival i was asked to oay   deposit would be taken off a credit debit card to cover any accidents or costs of using the mini bar i think this should be made more clear at time of booking i didn t have an issue with them taking card details as a precaution but the money was actually taken out of my account and i have to wait a few days for them to send the payment back rooms were outstanding and very comfortable and fully equipped views from the skybar were excellent staff very friendly and willing to help location was perfect due to us seeing a show at the   very closely situated to tube station and pier for getting into more central london there was dirty underwear left in the room from the previous guest all that was said was sorry a complimentary drink would have been nice considering i didn t expect that type of thing to happen in such hotel the mini bar hadn t been stocked from the previous guest and also the mini bar was thick with dust location disappointed in the cooked breakfast was not very hot and the black pudding didn t have much flavour loved the choice loved the view loved the service some aspects a bit over priced for example a dairy milk chocolate bar was   very comfortable room and bed lovely staff best hotel breakfast i ve ever had only the high pricing was disappointing the details didn t suggest that car parking was available at the hotel we thought that we needed to use the o  car parking this meant a   minute walk rooms and public areas furbished to a very high standard the most comfortable beds we ve slept in at an hotel breakfast offered the largest choice of cereals fresh fruits pastries cold meats cheeses and freshly cooked full english probably the best breakfast selection we ve had anywhere location next to the o  was a bonus as we were attending a show there couldn t fault anything the room was of a good size with a comfortable bed excellent lighting and lots of room in the bathroom with an excellent shower breakfast was really well worth the money so much choice and the pastries were yummy ideal for the o  will stay again the room was very warm had trouble sleeping likewise with other people we spoke to aircon needs to go lower the bed was very comfortable very close to o  bar prices in the skybar far too expensive we were going to the o  for a gig and the intercontinental was ideally situated with it being right next door to the arena the covered walkway to the o  was an added bonus and hotel room to venue in under   minutes was well worth the extra cost seeing that there was no queuing for transport had we gone to a hotel further out and the added cost thereafter which would have made a cheaper hotel in the docklands on oar on price to what we paid at the intercontinental but without the hassle the room we had was a superior king room suite excellent bed was comfortable room was spacious bathroom was superb after the gig we went to the top floor sky bar fir drinks with a lovely view of the docklands skykine only one complaint drinks were very expensive   year old single malt and a malibu and diet coke didn t bring much change back out of     ouch breakfast in the morning was exceptional everything you could think of english continental plus other items english breakfast was cooked well croissants and pastries all fresh we will be using this hotel for future gigs at the o  but will book an extra night in irder to take advantage of the pool spa and gym which we missed out on this time highly recommended hair dryer was hopeless kept cutting out the air conditioning didn t seem particularly effective it may have been helped by clearer instructions we were two single women and we were ignored in the top bar in favour or younger latecomers the wine waiter was rude however we enjoyed the position overlooking london the position the pool the bars provision of robes thought the hot breakfast items were very undercooked but just my personal choice i just prefer my bacon and sausage well done also the coffee was very average also if you use the covered walkway to the o  it takes you straight into the venue therefore missing the bars and restaurants which is not ideal lovely new hotel ideal for o  arena everything   star prices of course breakfast is expensive at   per person so hotel could do with another option coffee pastries cafe superb location for o  concert totally recommend hotel staff friendly professional and curtious although complimentary tea and coffee making facilities in room you only had   tea bags unless you like fruit teas and no complimentary water for a hotel of this standard was quite surprised mini bar very expensive location and access to the o  fantastic room restaurant and bar views great good tube connection only     mins walk breakfast was excellent great buffet choice the door was very hard to open to get into the room the bathroom was gorgeous loved that they had a speaker in the bathroom that was connected to the televisionno negative service in the whole hotel was fantastic especially ucha and andrea in the peninsula restaurant friendly clean and luxurious hotel comfortable beds and amazing views of the river and canary wharf the sky bar on the  th floor has stunning views across london everything you could think of and more for breakfast no negative everything was perfect for our stay while going to see lionel ritchie at the   the breakfast was to die for so much choice you would never leave there hungry so close to the   with their own walk through to venue the long queue for the breakfast room was a bit irritating although it moved quite quickly and the fact our table was cleared and reset whilst we were queueing for food was a bit too efficient excellent location for the o  arena our room was upgraded to a very nice suite which made our stay even more enjoyable the location is not ideal unless you are specifically going to the o  it s a bit out of the way for anything else and the taxi we got back from leicester square was outrageously expensive because of this the staff were very friendly the bed was so comfy and the facilities were great the overall look of the hotel inside is fantastic there was no price list for the fridge so we didn t have any drinks incase also as we entered the   from the hotel we weren t allowed in the   restaurants which is what we wanted to do we should have been told that when booking in so we could have gone in the main enterance a few members of staff didn t speak very good english when we asked a question loved the room over looking the river very quiet and very comfortable nil to note couldn t find fault with this hotel perfectly placed for the o  arena and london sight seeing extremely comfortable room and attractive public places the breakfast is outstanding all accompanied by a fabulous and professional team that really look after you we had a great stay our  nd and wouldn t hesitate to recommend the long queue for breakfast only negative on the weekend excellent facilities the staff where amazing they made our anniversary stay extra special amazing afternoon tea as well location out of the way a bit of a hike from the north greenwich tube station could have stayed in central london for same or cheaper price i wasn t seeing a concert at the o  arena so didn t need to stay there very new modern hotel with great views of the thames there was nothing not to like the bed was soooo comfortable we want to know where we can buy one apart from that everything was great all round excellent no negative great location for o  but also for the centre of london as the clipper river service stop is by the o  a great way to get into the centre with views excellent service in the hotel from all staff we encountered very professional amazing breakfast there wasn t too much that was not too like about it i know the hotel has only been opened since december so you expect a couple of hick ups the grounds outside have not been finished so the view from our room wasn t as good as i thought it would be there was a light in the bathroom that constantly flickered and the toilet flush made a noise for quite a while unless you kept pressing the button we came back late from concert went to floor   no seats left plus couldn t get a cup of latte or coffee i don t drink alcohol i m a soft drinker i did find drinks a little expensive didn t try restaurant but could imagine prices were high the actual hotel is beautiful the room was large and very comfortable the staff bent over backwards to make your stay memorable nothing was too hard for them the breakfast was plenty full and very tasty breakfast in your room is even more special and only   tray charge which is excellent there was everything in your room that you needed for your stay i can t think of one thing that could be missing or needed it was very clean loved it loved the touch of smoking area on  th floor as far as i can see i can t find anything else that would be needed to make the hotel a huge success it s an expensive hotel to stay in and of course the drinks bought there and the minibar are also very expensive the location of the hotel was brilliant for the o  the room was large with good facilities great bedding too the bathroom had a bath as well as a shower toiletries provided plus robe and slippers it was our anniversary and they d left us a small cake which was a great touch the staff were very helpful and polite we couldn t really have asked for more room smelt a little weird and unpleasant on arrival not enough milk tea or water in room tv didn t work for normal tv channels so couldn t watch tv excellent service venue design friendly welcoming and informative spacious and modern great views of the city there was nothing i didn t like fabulous hotel fantastic staff we had breakfast this time which was amazing so much choice we ll be getting it next time we go can t wait to go back again soon having booked   rooms spending over   for a night i thought the   parking charge was a complete joke as the person who booked the rooms not even the offer of complimentary parking closeness to the o  didn t realise how far away from train station cost a lot in taxi fares lovely setting very nice polite staff rooms nice an comfy direct link to o  is fab service at the bar was terribly slow should have been staffed to accommodate for the event happening at the o  that evening waited over   minutes just to be acknowledged incredible location brilliant parking and very nice room over crowded with conference the receptionist was excellent and changed our room without question as we were looking at pipes on the  rd floor and the river on the  th thought in excess of   per night for the room only was too much room was nice but not fabulous   per person for breakfast i think not fabulous location if attending the   arena all the staff we met were very nice although good the breakfast is too expensive access via the blackwall tunnel road is a nightmare the reception team were welcoming extra helpful our superior double was very comfortable with a great view of the river no negative excellent sized rooms with powerful shower and deep bath stunning views from room and eighteenth floor bar fabulous selection of different gins in the bar room service food good even though limited menu two minute walk to o  complex no negative the quiet i live in london but needed a night of solitude and good sleep this was perfect the whole pool and gym to myself swift service amazing view from the un crowded top floor bar it s a bit corporate but then it s a chain hotel and that s what i was looking for when i stayed love love love being asked to pay a one hundred pound deposit just in case i break anything made me feel like a little tramp that shouldn t be stopping there the facilitiesno negative this is how good the service was i asked a member of the concierge team the quickest route to the greenwich north tube station he kindly quided me to the limousine and drove me to the station nothing from the minute of standing in front of the reception you made to feel valued all staff were great room fabulous breakfast was so good words cannot tell the storey fab hotel will go back the only thing which could be difficult in future bookings with a friend is that twin bed rooms do not have accessible bathrooms i don t always travel with my husband so i wouldn t want to share a bed i have a complaint which means i cannot have bedclothes on my lower legs so prefer and need a bed for myself comfy bed accessible shower as disabled very clean all staff were very kind and helpful no negative bed was very comfortable and cozy room was super clean and i loved the fact that everything was newly built   staff were very friendly and willing to make guests feel at home location was great because it was only   minutes by walk to the train station the jubilee line is so efficient in terms of going to other touristic popular destinations even if it looks quite far from the distance wise it only took about   min by train to arrive at the most popular stations like green park etc they offer me an upgrade for extra money but the room was almost the same of original one maybe even worst room size very small with that price i could have a nicer   star in london staff very helpful perfect location nice comfort and service like spa restaurant nothing comes to mind that disliked the variety at breakfast the bed which was very comfortable the approachable friendly staff who were very good with grandchildren who came to visit at the hotel the spaciousness and airiness of the hotel and wonderful views we got an very good deal on the price but would not be able to afford it normally everything the hotel was amazing the staff friendly and the food at breakfast varied the private walkway to the o  made the whole event so much easier and the security staff were very helpful and friendly nothing this is a wonderful hotel the staff were lovely especially diana who checked us in and looked after us it s so convenient for the o  the breakfast was gorgeous and our room was fabulous and so are the facilities from the pool gym and sauna to the bareighteen with fabulous views over the thames don t hesitate to book here especially if you like luxury there wasn t anything i didn t particularly like apart from i got a bit lost and there wasn t many signs the bed was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep room was very spacious and had a lovely view from our window staff very polite and friendly outstanding features throughout the hotel very pleased the only negative that i didn t like is a survice charge being added to everything ie in the bar and restaurants i like to tip but don t like it being added as a survive charge staff lovely brilliant views great vacilitys great location sky bar drinks are expensive that s all i can say but it s london so can t really say much what can i say first class service staff are amazing food is amazing loved it will defo go back   star service staff wrapped a little tight food and bars burger super breakfast outstanding the views bright clean brilliant access to arena staff superbly attentive price of drinks were off the scale far too pricey beautifully appointed rooms comfy beds great bars spa fabulous one of the best massages ive ever had nothing fastastic location with easy access from greenwich station unimaginable view on every floor especially the  th floor bar it s a place to be well trained and happy staff parking fees slow cocktail bar we book the hotel over the internet a few days later we visited the   and the hotel so i could get my bearings we ask the receptionist about parking i was under the impression that parking was free i was most upset to find that infact we would have to pay a fee of   plus but because we were guests we would get a reduced price of   wow   for a room and then paying for parking car park was empty thank you very much after a wonderful stay in your hotel room food was great service was very slow on the  th floor cocktail lounge infact after waiting a good ten minutes with out service and no acknowledgement we left we were both looking forward to a cocktail but decided to retire to the bar on the  nd floor great service from your staff also perhaps if you took away the bar stool away from the cocktail bar area we might have been able to get to the bar to be served regards mr mrs c dobson a return trip i would love at sometime but would have to really think about it the walk from tube station to reception while short was a little difficult to negotiate perfect location for visiting the o  great views comfortable and quiet rooms staff friendly and very helpful no negative the rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable the staff friendly and helpful and the location to the o  couldn t have been better will most definitely visit again no negative as we were going to the o  it is right next door and has it s own covered access all the staff reception bars dining room were very helpful and friendly very comfortable made our concert so much more enjoyable some of the prices for drinks   for a bottle of peroni in the two bars i thought was a bit costly everything very helpful staff lovely rooms all finished to an excellent standard great free use of swimming pool and spa not the easiest to get to if you arrive into victoria from gatwick at rush hour as we did we did take a taxi as the feedback from fellow guests was that it s quite a walk from the underground to the hotel with luggage a courtesy service for arriving guests perhaps lovely bed great staff went the extra mile lovely bar with fantastic views very comfortable overall room service excellent room facilities as expected for this caliber of hotel no free wifi no value for money spent i basically paid for the location how close it was to the   i think the room was quite standard staff needs more training on the services the hotel provides and the information to provide to guest some staff do not know that there is an atm located in the hotel on the ground floor one staff almost made me drive all the way to the train station to get cash i am so happy that i checked with some one else located mins to the   arena excellent staff were friendly and some staff were helpful room was clean the view was lovely from the hotel window having paid quite a bit for the room the pricey minibar and guest charger etc i just found offensive to be honest either provide the things free or leave them for people to request if needed staff were really helpful and kind the tea cups in the room hadn t been washed properly didn t expect that at a   hotel the shower head in the bathroom sprayed unevenly skybar was lovely the staff were very attentive welcoming and friendly great views across the river the parking cost me   pounds for   hours which was a bit annoying they have a huge car park so i didn t expect any charge staff at check in were the most friendly helpful staff i think i have ever encountered couldn t do enough for me the room was beautifully clean and modern the walk through shuts up about  am i was in a late event that finished about   and had to walk back to hotel but not moning only took   mins which i thought could of used walkway but overal you must stay there great stay for my birthday with a friend amazing view of the river and the o  couldn t ask for much more for the price i have paid i was very surprised that the hotel was charging   for wifi in most hotels it is completely free so i don t think it s acceptable for a room that is so expensive very comfortable bed very close to the o  arena   minutes walk i couldn t fault this hotel in anyway the hotel was excellent in every way right from arrival the staff were friendly and accommodating the breakfast staff were amazing and even offered my kids pancakes which were lovely they had a variety of restaurants to choose from the facilities were top notch the hotel is right next door to the   less than a   minute walk i really enjoyed my stay and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again we booked the hotel with the intention of using the spa facilities unfortunately on the day we wanted to use the spa the jacuzzi was out of service other than that everything was great staff were all friendly and attentive facilities were excellent food was great drinks were lovely couldn t fault a single thing no negative the rooms are spacious with the beds being extra comfortable and the location of the hotel is great with the o  just being right next door the indoor pool is brilliant the hotel itself is amazing the staff here are very helpful and i will definitely look into staying here again the check in was all a bit rushed we were not informed where breakfast was served and as it is a big hotel it meant a bit of wandering around to find the room we were not given a copy of our hotel bill at the end of the stay and i forgot to ask for it not enough tv channels for a   star safety box was quite hot inside as it was located directly above the mini bar so the heat was radiating up into it the light switches next to the bed only on one side governs the whole lights so if the person on the other side wants to get up in the night they have to do so in the dark the view out the window was miserable straight on to an unfinished tower block the design of the breakfast room means some tables have a good view of the river while many others don t as the separators are very high so you can t see around your little area   minute walk to the o  arena and the tube stop great the room was a nice size for a   night stay the bathroom was a nice design but the shower door is already leaking a bit and it s a new hotel tea and coffee facilities was welcome and expected for a   star got seated in the bar waited   minutes to be asked if i wanted a drink then i asked the waitress   more times if she could serve us as after a hour and half we left without still being served no positive found out once there that the car park wasn t   for  hrs it was actually   we stayed in the hotel because of it being in an ideal location for seeing a concert at the o  area due to being located directly next door definitely recommend with the facilities available nothing we were attending a concert at the o  so the location could not have been any better everyone we meet was very polite and profectional and facilities could t have been improved views and breakfast were wonderfull was not told on booking to my knowledge that there was a   a night charge up front for potential extras however it appears you can get away without paying this on the basis you cannot access the minibar and if you have anything you need to pay for in the hotel you have to pay for it up front as opposed to charging it to your room the tv wasn t tuned in properly so had to get a technician to show me how to get it to work the thermostat controls minus and plus touch buttons don t illuminate so i couldn t see how to control the thermostat in the dark at night having forgotten about the plus and minus signs again having to get a technician up to my room for me to realise why i couldn t adjust it beside lamp didn t work as bulb had blown and i didn t see switch for it hanging down the side of the bedside cabinet my rating as added up by booking com of     is more like a   in reality good bed and generally comfortable room good breakfast but no fried bread or tinned tomatoes although chef did cook me fried bread on request and i was told i could ask for something if i wanted it shower in the bathroom wasn t clean properly and stain on bed duvet sheet but other than that high cleanliness standard bed was amazing the staff were very welcoming and friendly and room was lush i awoke with a very sore neck due to the pillows but that s just preference the pool was beyond cold which meant we had to confine the little one to the jacuzzi which was dissapointing seeing as we booked the hotel solely due to it having the pool we were given a complimentary upgrade and a late check out which was wonderful as meant we could attend the show we had booked and still return and enjoy the hotel after the room was spotless as was the hotel in general we initially booked a standard double room and then a week before we were due to stay went online and found a superior king at the hotel for   cheaper a lucky find but a bit cheeky of the hotel to try and charge more for a less superior room also service at breakfast was a bit poor as we had to wait   minutes for our tea and they didn t give us any milk very luxurious and perfect for an event at the o  love the walkway between hotel and o  very convenient breakfast was absolutely sublime so many choices and cooked to perfection delicious nothing could have been better the staff were friendly the bed was so comfy the walk way to the o  was so helpful and the whole hotel was execellent expensive breakfast options limited quantity of drinks in room tea coffee only   tea bags per day hugely comfy beds great view perfect for the   with direct access good transport choices closeby nothing really air con could of been a bit stronger but that s only me picking something the bed was really comfortable shower was amazing and the staff were so polite and friendly not enough tea coffee etc in room we were very happy with the room the bed was very comfortable staff were helpful next to the o  was perfect as we went to see david haye fight for   p night the room facilities were a laugh one tiny bottle of body wash between two one milk ration each and no buscuit no menu for room service its on the tv so have to operate the remote first finally when it did arrive it was luke warm unappetising and very expensive four small beers platter of meat awful one soup one cold chips two rock hard bread rolls came to   there was no mention of charges for parking on the booking form that was an extra   p night in all a very expensive hotel that had all the ambience of an airport lounge and finally don t bother with the postcode for the sat nav we tried it in three of them and it wasn t recognised ended up using my phone which died on me   at the hotel for use of a charger so unless you really need to stay there don t you will find a lot better in the city for the same price and get the docklands light over beds were comfy breakfast was good with lots of choice the pricing was a little high for just one night the rooms were lovely and the beds were so comfy great location as we was going to a concert at the o  and the walk way to the hotel took     minutes the only thing missing is a shop inside the hotel lobby marvellous new facility everything excellent especially staff sara business centre saved my day i breakfast could have been better everything was great doc was so helpful when we checked in he told us about the sky bar which was absolutely amazing views some things were a bit sloppy eg no hotel information in room telling us we had breakfast included when we didn t takes a long time checking in too the beds are amazing so lovely such a lovely turn down service as well prices a little expensive especially the wines but hey its london very professionally run hotel the manager ryan was helpful and courteous nothing was too much trouble and went out of his way to accommodate my son and daughter in law who were i ll before arriving a refreshing change for a big hotel chain other staff just as friendly food excellent compliments to the chefs modern exceptional rooms best choice of breakfast food we ve ever seen in a hotel and we ve stopped in some nice hotels having to leave the buffet breakfast was excellent we went half an hour before it finished but you d never know everything was still available and very fresh no negative brilliant access to the o  and the room was amazing unfortunately didn t get to sample breakfast as we were a little worse for wear after a heavy night but everything else was exceptional they automatically add     service charge on bills i would prefer to choose if i tip and know the individual will recieve drinks very expensive etc    g dairy milk in mini bar     small glass wine in bar lounge so bear in mind on extras not value for money but as posh treat great to save for staff and service perfect best had room clean and bed very comfortable everything you need and high end which reflected in price breakfast fantastic quality will stay again if go to   we arrived by a thames clippers boat and although the hotel is not far we had to walk a long way around the fence to get to the reception by the same road as cars a gate for foot passengers arriving by river would be good it s a fantastic very modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff our room was spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was excellent and the spa swimming pool superb needed air con to work a bit better there was no book with info of the hotel in the room explaining amenities etc in hotel lighting a little bit dull could have done with brighter lights maybe excellent breakfast clean bathroom and good amenities in bathroom nice comfy bed with lovely covers and pillows friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel had to wait to get access to the  th floor bar which seemed weird as i was actually paying to stay in the hotel i should have been able to get in no problem breakfast was amazing and so was the shower nothing beautiful hotel staff were very friendly rooms were lovely sky bar and clipper bar both have great views over the thames great choice of food for breakfast and in the perfect location for o  events no negative the walkway to the o  was a god send the staff were very helpful and friendly and the whole hotel had a luxurious but welcoming feel we will definitely stay here again the eighteenth floor bar was not accessible due to its size therefore could not offer all facilities if hotel busy excellent facilities and good staff just felt there could of been more facilities within the hotel but this wasn t really a massive negative the location was perfect for the o  also the views of canary wharf were stunning to see staff were very willing to help and offer a great service throughout our stay room not ready on time had to upgrade to get a room otherwise would have to wait   minutes breakfast very expensive you would have to eat all morning to get value for money good location for the   very comfy bed and good view very long  mins queue to check in room wasn t ready at     so we dumped our bags and headed out nice room good breakfast amazing position for the o  the jacuzzi not working all the staff were friendly helpful and very polite nothing was to much trouble our room was spotless with stunning views of the thames breakfast so much choice excellent had to wait quite a while to be served but that s all nothing really to say for one was so close to the o  room very comfy people were very welcoming the views were lovely especially from the bar at the top on my floor was a group of wedding guests who spent all night partying with no intervention from hotel security they set off a fire alarm by smoking and when i complained in the morning the reception staff were not that bothered i didn t sleep a wink until around  am and then i was up at  am as i had to be out to another appointment hotel and location and facilities and the cocktail lounge the only thing that upset us was we were decline to go into the bar on level   and no member of staff told us we could have booked to go in later the rooms and view were fantastic the staff were very helpful getting to our concert from hotel was relaxing and not at all stressful slightly off the beaten track around behind the o    min walk when on foot as entrance is facing the river and very car friendly would not stop me from staying again as this is a small inconvenience and the hotel and staff are lovely wonderful reception staff lovely sky bar and high spec all around waited   mins for a pot of tea at breakfast after ordering it staff room convenience to the o  but most of all the superb breakfast what a spread the mini bar staff were not very helpful he couldn t use any common sense they tried to charge us for taking items from the mini bar even though it was empty the bed was huge the mattress was very thick excellently located for the o  nothing it was my girlfriend victoria from guest relations made sure i had a great room and helped me organise a romantic turndown i love this hotel and will be back very soon great view from room the one thing that bothered me or maybe i misheard the receptionist but a   pound deposit to get access to the minibar or even a deposit at all for that made me stay away anyway and i usually don t no positive check in slow and staff unhelpful they would not allow her to check in as i had made the booking she had her passport and the joint payment card but no they made my wife wait  hours in the bar for security reasons   for the refreshments whilst she waited poor management room more like a suite very nice the only problem i had was finding the hotel leaving north greenwich underground station there were not any direction signs i knew it was alongside the o  it was difficult to find because there is still building work nearby you have to enter the   and walk to the rear of   to find it so please direction signs are urgently needed for the traveller on foot i do not like walking around in circles no positive staff in the sky bar really struggled and had to wait for ages for champagne cocktail that arrived flat   for a flat cocktail is not good would have complained but there was a queue doing that life too short breakfast was good but again system failure with too many requests for coffee required before coffee arrived and finally computer systems in peninsular restaurant did not pick up request for pre theatre meal dealt with but irritating superb location and facilities top notch staff were polite and keen but see negatives for levels of training and management peninsula restaurant food was superb what is there to dislike nothing the bed was extremely comfortable staff were very friendly breakfast was lovely a great amount to choose from stayed mainly for il divo concert the o  was a two minute walk as someone who is disabled walking distances is an issue its a shame all that open space at the front door is not used for disabled parking just a thought everything apart from parking i have no negative comments i took my friend on a surprise trip to see a concert we were fortunate enough to be upgraded which just made a lovely weekend perfect nothing was too much trouble and the staff have been trained to a very high standard the lady at breakfast even found a particular tea for my friend and came back to ask if she was happy with it small things go a long way thank you ordered breakfast to the room took over   hours even though i had called three times to remind them the views over the river were amazing the bar was lovely and relaxed it was not too over crowded but had a dj so a lovely vibe to it on checking in we politely made it clear we were running late for a show at the o  and literally had   mins the reception heard but didn t listen and proceeded to spend the   minutes telling us every little detail of the new hotel of which she was clearly proud just needed a bit more customer sensitivity and a bit less brand obsession bed was very comfortable and room beautifully appointed it made our weekend trip thank you unless i left   deposit on check in there was no milk for coffee which is in the mini bar put some milk out please or tell people i had no intent on using the minibar for alcohol etc but could have been told this good powerful shower can t hear doors in the corridor my vertigo after looking out of my window that feel of luxury that jo public doesn t often experience or can often afford the absolute professionalism of the staff to make your stay as hassle free as possible ab fab the only moan is the very high hotel car park fee after paying good money for hotel i found this s little high atmosphere in hotel very good the staff were extra good special mention for ade who was very nice nothing all good beds were really comfy lovely cake left for birthday treat without charge fabulous views children welcome at certain times in spa pool which was fab lovely to be able to get straight into hotel after concert at o  great stay will be going back price of drinks and food very expensive room had the most wonderful view of the river and the hotel was perfect for the o  l loved every minute of the stayno negative bed was very comfortable apart from the pillows we found them too soft but that can bee a personal preference room was really spacious with superb views over the thames breakfast was amazing and the hotel itself felt luxurious and spotlessly clean all staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable would stay again good transport links no negative the room was well laid out and the bed and bed linen top notch slept so well i felt comfortable in every part of the hotel well done intercontinental o  nothing couldn t have been better everything i m a particularly fussy traveller but the intercontinental was perfect in particular i thought this was exceptional value given its location swimming pool was freezing jacuzzi was not working men walking into the women s changing room coca cola can costs like   friendly staff very clean hotel the cleanliness of the room was disappointing we found hair in our bed and in the bathtub the toilet had a brown stain around the rim of the seat and the air conditioning didn t seem to work properly so we ended up sleeping on top of the bed all night your staff were polite and very helpful the food was excellent with plenty to choose from the restaurants were very clean and the views were fantastic no negative the staff were super friendly and it was an incredible room bed was very comfortable and service was amazing we got a free upgrade to a king room which was amazing although pst of the staff were very good we couldn t get served in the sky bar during the day as there was nobody there also a maintenance chap just knocked and came in to our room at   am just as my partner was getting out of bed she was not happy clean well located and excellent facilities the jacuzzi was not working on my second visit on my first the steam room was not open i came to use the spa facilities it s my bday month no special treats given due to birthday quick check in and the upgrade although the room seemed the same just a few floors up from where we stayed receptionist wanted to enroll me to the membership program to give me a late check out the staff was very welcoming from the doorman shacking our hand to great us the guest relations manager dov checking us in and tacking us around at breakfast everything was great aswell especially the blond gentleman who worked the night before thank you for everything nothing at the moment staff were fab rooms lovely it was our anniversary and the hotel kindly upgraded is already booked again for the   june can t wait no slippers in spa or room had to go bare foot as had no flip flops with me when i asked spa girl and reception for some they said there was none available the bed was extremely comfortable and the spa facilities were perfect we had breakfast brought to our room bang on the time requested such a large breakfast well worth it i feel a nespresso machine would have been a nicer touch than the tassimo also more than two coffee pods would have been nice and maybe some little biscuits seems like a petty thing but we had this at a far less superior hotel and it was a really nice touch pillows were lush great views perfect for the o  especially with the tunnel through open  pm midnight lovely decor and detailing staff friendly and helpful jennifer on reception made us feel very welcome although the drinks in the sky bar are a tad on the pricey side the view at night is so good you get some little snacks you are served drinks at your seat and the staff are attentive without being overbearing oh and the lime soap in the bathroom was lush think the sky bar needs more staff lots of nuts dirty glasses left on tables short staff issue managemen need to attend great rooms bed linen towels dressing gowns a lot of kids in the spa pool but it was a weekend the incredible close up view of the o  from our room like a huge man made ski slope the breakfast was also excellent catered for all tastes and very well done shortage of staff in the bar   minute wait for service as there were only   bar staff serving when concert at o  finished slow coffee service at breakfast same problem insufficient staff proximity to the o  friendly staff bedroom there did not seem to be enough staff on duty i had to queue for  mins to check in and had to try calling room service   times before i got an answer which i don t think is acceptable in a   hotel however the hotel was not busy by any means hardly saw any other guests in fact the room was amazing and at a great price too i had a twin aspect view overlooking the river on one side and the top of the o  from another the hotel has some amazing facilities too especially the sky bar bar service in the skyline bar was very slow no draft beers had to ask several times for tea coffee at breakfast think they might of been shortstaffed or something everything else was wonderful we stayed one night as we were going to a concert at the o  we really couldn t have stated anywhere closer or better shannon on reception made us feel very welcome we loved the bed it was so comfortable it was like sleeping in marshmallows loved the spa swimming pool thank you also to aishling for making us feel so welcome breakfast was wonderful so much choice worth every penny beautiful hotel great service and immaculately clean no shower gel in the room although there was soap my husband asked for extra coffee pods but they never materialised the breakfast was lovely had everything i could think of i only wish i had a bigger stomach to fit it all in being overcharged by   with no explanation this wasn t even detailed on the final invoice even worse i have contacted the hotel by phone email and facebook and have still received no reply to top it off the milk in the minibar in our hotel room was dated       over a week old i hate to nit pick but i was highly disappointed by the service i ve recieved since leaving the hotel excellent location amazing views and lovely facilities waiting   minutes for a drink following the concert checking out i wanted to stay another night it was that good we stayed at the intercontinental for just the one night as we went to watch elo at the   we did not experience any difficulties on check in and our room was ready for the  pm check in time the staff at the hotel were impeccable throughout and could not have done anymore to make our stay more enjoyable our room was spacious and immaculately clean with great views over the river thames coffee making facilities were first class the shower had the biggest shower head i have ever seen and we both enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep we ate in the hotel bar before the concert and can recommend the fish and chips again the bar staff were attentive and catered for all of our needs following the concert we visited the amazing bar on the  th floor a beautiful place to relax and again floor to ceiling views overlooking the thames they even have an outside smoking area for smokers so it saves going downstairs   floors to have one my only slight complaint would be that there were insufficient bar staff on duty to cater for the numbers returning to the hotel after the concert and we had to wait about   minutes to get served a few extra bar staff would solve this especially when there is a popular event on at the   the drinks are pricey so if you are looking to pinch a penny to save a pound then this hotel is not for you personally i would rather pay a little bit extra as for me the experience outweighed the cost considerably the next morning we went for breakfast about    am and did not experience any of the queues that some previous reviewers have mentioned a wonderful selection of pastries and everything you could wish for from an english breakfast before checking out we ventured for a swim in the indoor swimming pool you really must check this out during your stay as again it was a wonderful experience and the staff were a credit to the hotel we were not able to get in to the sky bar when we got back to the hotel in the evening had we been told on check in that it would be best to book we would have done this when we checked in but the staff at the other bar were very helpful and let us know that we could move up there with our drinks later on in night so it was not really a big issue amazing breakfast and the staff couldn t do enough to help throughout our stay no negative the staff were exceptional as were the facilities we had the most amazing meal with one meal being cooked to order to accommodate allergies would recommend visiting the  th floor to have a cocktail or two the views were incredible can t recommend enough everything was perfect i can t even think of one bad point i booked for my partners birthday and i can t express enough how helpful and sweet all the staff were at the reception and door helping me with the gifts and balloons i had brought along we had a nice spacious room with a bath and shower and lovely view and we absolutely loved the jacuzzi and swimming pool we went to the sky bar on the top floor and was lucky enough to get the seats near the window with a view of the city lights thank you so so much for such an amazing stay my partner said it was one of the best stays he s ever had and was a special experience for the both of us cannot wait to come back we re having a look already when we can book again extra big thank you to a member of staff called shannon for making it extra special no negative we went to a concert at the o  and last minute for ease decided to stay at the hotel we were running late for the start of the concert the staff could not have been more helpful in rushing is over and showing us the way to the o  the hotel car park was a real bonus too the room was quiet clean and comfortable bed was very comfy great shower coffe machine in room was a bonus i will definitely stay again next time i visit the o  really recommend it it transformed our evening and enjoyment of it it really is just a   minute walk to the o  no negative been at this hotel before and never been disappointed special touch with the receptionist diana who sent a note under our door to wish my wife and me a good night at the concert we had booked what a lovely little touch well done wanted to have a drink in the eighteen sky bar but unable to enter as too busy resorted to mini bar friendly helpful staff excellent location for o  very comfortable bed breakfast was a mess too many people too few staff which meant the food orders were late we decided to have the cold buffet instead of the full english this was recognised by the manager and a refund for the drinks the previous night was given along with and appreciation of our comments we were met by the valet parking attendant and the concierge who took our bags the check in took   minutes the luggage along with ourselves were in our room within   minutes of arriving excellent front of house service the room was excellent great views across the river thames on the  th floor there is a sky bar with an excellent selection of cocktails and craft beers at night panoramic window which over looks canary wharf mimics the manhattan skyline well worth a visit just for this checking in was rather slow it was the weekend of the london marathon so they were not really prepared for the number of people that were trying to check in not only for the marathon but for the concert at the o  as well lovely spacious room which had a comfortable bed we also liked how close the hotel was to the o  breakfast was a bit pricey at   pp for a full english even though we had paid     for our room we just didn t bother with breakfast first impressions were excellent the staff were very welcoming our room was very comfortable there was even a tunnel to get to the o  arena without having to walk around the fact that breakfast was so expensive and indeed not included in the price also that car parking again was very expensive especially as there was no alternative guests i believe should have a special rate i hate to think what the cost might have been should we have stayed for a number of days easy to find very well situated for our own personal requirements the visiting of the o  centre staff were very friendly and attentive big problems with the kitchen in the brasserie long wait only to find the chef read the ticket wrong and produced a different dish front of house staff friendly and efficient no positive drinks were quite pricey we had a first class stay and would recommend   staff were very helpful throughout our stay including graham who drove us to the station on our departure with my mobility issues such professional customer service and so kind the food and whole ambiance of hotel really fabulous the breakfasts were stunning with the best we ve seen in a hotel we initially booked as hotel so close to   and with connection corridor which for my mobility issues made the whole experience two wonderful days for a special treat no negative excellent customer service a   hotel with a relaxed atmosphere which is not at all pretentious as some   hotels can be friendly helpful efficient staff made our stay memorable clearer signing from the o  to the covered walkway i couldn t find it and ended up walking along the road room staff and food were all excellent i will come here again nothing fabulous room everything you needed complimentary toiletries bathroom spotlessly clean with all mod cons big fluffy towels coffee maker kettle tea coffee milk and a safe in the room big comfy bed pillows very quiet area good nights sleep staff were very helpful happy and friendly location perfect for the o  sky bar superb views breakfast was fantastic one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in we would definitely recommend swimming pool was out of action which for a family was most disappointing to my teenager we had booked the hotel as it had a pool aircon was temperamental but they came to fix it very quickly excellent service and comfy rooms brilliant views of london we went to a concert at the   and came straight back after it had finished but couldn t get any food anywhere other than room service didn t want to go back to the room so made do with complimentary nuts not quite what we were hoping for it would be good if food could be served later even its only sandwiches room with a great view of the o  fabulous bathroom lovely robes and towels and best shower ever even better than all the ones we ve tried in the usa really comfy bed and good coffee machine staff were extra friendly and helpful the facilities in general are first class it wasn t a cheap stay but well worth the price disappointed with concierge taxi booked and pre paid to hotel did not turn up we had to get dlr instead as couldn t get to us in time to catch flight location and friendly staff we had a three and half hour wait for our room treated very well whilst waiting however meant we had no time to prepare for the concert in the evening which we had to go to straight away fabulous hotel staff were polite and very helpful given long delays at check in room was great clean comfortable and terrific views we arrived at  pm yet our room was not available until  pm only   minutes before our concert at the   next door despite us pushing several times great location and friendly staff car park was very expensive our room took   hours to be ready when we arrived but the duty manager did all in his power to compensate for this we were very impressed the room was excellent and very comfortable the staff were very attentive and pleasant there was ample parking on site we were there for a concert at the o  so the   minute walk was brilliant for the price i would ve liked the car parking to be complimentary amazing suite with fantastic views really friendly and accommodating staff particularly the spa manager and the doorman valet great location and a really superb hotel throughout absolutely no complaints a fantastic weekend i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody and will most certainly be returning access and proximity to the o  arena is unrivalled great bathrooms and really big and comfortable beds the fillet steak in the restaurant was some of the best i ve eaten the pool and spa area are fantastic nothing at all everything was     we stopped for the elo concert at the   arena i thought the short cut thru the hotel to the   was great and saved a good walk hotel was absolutely incredible and we would not esitate to use again if we stay in london again also the staff and concierge was extremely helpful really nice people long queue to book in at    pm room not ready at    pm but they found us one when pressed excellent service lovely room and very good tea and coffe making bed was huge as was the shower breakfast was first class room not ready by     or    pm still waiting for room     given a key to room that didn t work then had to move everything up two floors to correct room location to the o  very comfortable bed the only thing that we could possibly comment on would be that the tea at breakfast was rather weak all of the facilities were excellent staff could not do enough for you all were happy with great smiles a big thanks to graham the doorman who was knowledgeable helpful and very chatty cold plates at breakfast so cooked breakfast was cold by the time i sat down having to queue to sign in a coach had just arrived i think very quiet and comfortable and convenient for the o  prices are on the expensive side so would only stay here for a special occasion also you have to pay for parking the service in market brasserie was a bit slow but i have put that down to new hotel new staff etc almost everything it was pure luxury indulgent we tried all restaurants and the food was amazing in all of them the cocktails in   sky bar were delicious looking forward to going back plumbing definitely not what you d expect in a   hotel nowhere to hang wet towels and the television didn t work which is bad for such a new hotel food good and service good all staff very attentive the room was comfortable and a good size some biscuits on the tea tray would have been nice apart from that i couldn t fault anything fabulous pool great for marathon my son was running excellent pleasant staff especially helpful was andrei on reception great shortcut to o  a fabulous stay and i would use again over an hour to check in staff excellent but overwhelmed by everyone arriving at the same time nearly   hours to get a table in the bar and get some food bar lovely but way way too small not allowed into the much hyped  th floor bar as two large groups in for birthday celebrations unacceptable for residents to be treated like that bright new modern had to change bedrooms twice as the first two rooms smelt like smoke cigarette great customer service really enjoyed our stay would certainly recommend the advertised walkway straight to the   isn t even open yet and they didn t advise of tight restrictions on when children can use the pool very frustrating lovely luxurious room with huge windows great view no negative stayed here as we were attending a concert at the o  the room was nice with a great view of the river and the breakfast was very good cant speak highly enough of the quality of the food and the service from the staff in the peninsular restaurant first class i loved all of it it was in a perfect position for the o  direct access via a small tunnel the room was lovely spacious bathroom with separate shower and bath and the pool was wonderful finally the breakfast was one of the best i ve ever had so much choice and attentive service even when busy could have been a little bit more reasonably priced in house parking very expensive bed was like sleeping on a cloud spacious and well equipped room great breakfast nothing the room was to a very high standard from the small touches like coffee maker in the room to the amazingly comfy bed and   star breakfast the staff were very polite dressed immaculately and would do anything to help nothing staff were excellent and always ready to help food tasted like it had been cooked and not warmed up like so many hotels plus you do not wait long in the restaurants because there are staff everywhere beds are comfortable even for sore bones and are very large rooms and bathrooms are excellent location for the o  cannot be bettered it s outside the back door however if going elsewhere tube not far away perhaps   minutes walk so very good for central london very quiet no main roads going past so no traffic noise at night breakfast was the only disappointing part we arrived   minutes before the end so naturally had a slight queue to get in but once we were in we were seated quickly the staff were a little disappointing very friendly but no one seemed to be assigned to our table we waited at least ten minutes before we got coffee then had to queue for the breakfast buffet after another     minutes of the queue not moving i gave up and decided to order from the menu it was around     minutes after arriving that we finally got a menu after quite a long wait and at the close of breakfast we were served our eggs benedict which were really delicious but all in all it wasn t a particularly enjoyable breakfast experience to top it all off we had the misfortune of being seated next to a family who decided it was acceptable to wear their pyjamas to breakfast and let their children run around next to us really quite disappointing from a five star hotel the hotel overlooks the river thames and the financial district so amazing views less than five minutes walk from the   the decor is stunning and the greeting and reception staff were phenomenal particularly the smartly dressed concierge who took our luggage and made sure we got checked in two hours before check in time the superior hotel room was amazing spacious beautifully decorated and immaculately clean we even had a tassimo coffee machine the added extras such as cotton buds shower cap and hair band etc were a nice touch plus the variety of things in the mini bar too the tv was even amazing it had youtube movies and other channels plus all the hotel information including a little history of the chain room service menu breakfast and even your bill the room also had the comfiest bed i think i ve ever slept in our view was the o  building i couldn t have asked for a better room lots of facilities but we didn t get a chance to use them we also didn t make use of the sky bar but from what we saw it looked amazing the other really good thing was the hotel have their own access to through to the o  which means you cut out the walking round time and are under shelter aside from a   second walk across beware though it closes at  am and if you miss it like us you have to walk the long way round the hotel is overpriced customer service was poor as we were charged for taking food from the mini bar when we did not the room key card system broke in the hotel and it took   hours of us chasing up various members of staff before we had a key and electricity to the room we did receive a letter of apology from the hotel but we still feel let down by the service the room was clean the beds were comfortable and the room offers everything that you need the view from the room was fantastic and the access to the   arena was very handy fire alarm went off briefly in night but staff seemed unaware complementary milk in our room was out of date unable to pre book hotel parking staff at o  claimed that covered walkway to hotel wasn t yet open although we d gone thru it from hotel certainly the hotel was very poorly signposted from the arena took ages to get back a hotel of this standard should have a dress code for breakfast there were some very scruffy people in there great location for o  room was fab really luxurious and well equipped staff really helpful and polite no negative a brilliant experience from the hotel and the quality of furnishings to the friendly and extremely helpful staff breakfast had so much choice will recommend   the costs of drinks in the clipper bar are extortionate   peroni s and a cuba libra very little change from   but it is   star we were given an upgraded room due to problems with our original room and subsequent late check it the room was stunning the staff are so friendly and welcoming especially graham the doorman whom we laughed with a genuine gentleman the walkway to the arena is a great bonus too i was given a great room upon early check in and told to return later when it was ready promised views over the o  i was very happy however when we did return we were given a completely different room which had no nice view not at all happy with this i was told at reception that unfortunately they had to give me a different room so who got my room and why i did mention this upon check out and received an apology it was the same chap that booked me in the day before and he did seem a bit guilty ie ever he was very pleasant and polite and gave me complimentary parking it didn t make it right but was a little sweetener i will await any management response with interest it is very new so in great shape but also it does seem well cared for it is a very nice hotel with everything you could wish for really but at a price great choice at breakfast i highly recommend the lamb sausages delicious i will definitely go back as it is so very convenient for o  and it is nice the fire alarm going off at    am ish not due to the hotel but a guest attending a wedding staff very apologetic extremely welcoming staff and wonderfully comfortable beds and pillows great location for the o  which is  mins walk almost under covet additional service charges on everything soon racks up the bill go to the bar and get your own drink or they charge you     to bring it to where you are sitting very helpful staff and plenty of them over friendly staff over priced breakfast long walk from venue clipper service when event wasn t on not allowed to use the tunnel looking out on a great view of canary wharf but looking down on the floors kitchens below seeing dirty crockery loo rolls on all the windowsills near the venue fire alarm early hours not the hotel fault and was cleared up quickly great view amazing spa perfect breakfast perfect bed bose music in bathroom breakfast was a shambles long queue outside the breakfast room poor management that with guests from a wedding also staying they did not make alternative arrangements they have another dining room which was not in use all very unsatisfactory no positive service was terrible for a hotel like this breakfast was a nightmare no food with people queuing for over   minutes for the buffet rooms really lovely the limited access for the sky bar unfortunately after the gig the bar was full so we were unable to experience it the location was the best part views of the o  and the thames amazing breakfast walk way between the o  and hotel was closed a bit of an inconvenience because that s why we booked the hotel didn t bring jackets and was cold outside while walking excellent the walk from the o  the previous night when we didn t know about the short cut took us about   minutes as we had to wait in the tube queue before we could get round the corner to the hotel beds very comfortable quiet rooms fabulous views from enormous windows everything perfect especially when graham the concierge told us about the door to the o  arena our concert finished and within   minutes we were in the stunning bar on the top floor of the hotel avoiding all the queues getting out of the o  brilliant great concert but the hotel was the icing on the cake the service here is a joke on arrival we where told our room wasn t ready this was at    pm and we would have to wait   mins  hr  mins we manage to get a key and then off to the room we go to find out the key isn t working off i go back to recp to wait another  mins then we manage to get into our room off we go to the elo gig at the end of the gig we head back to go to the sky bar to find out we can t get in as they had two big tables book in there and they where full so we go to the clipper bar and have to wait   mins to wait to get served and have to stand as no tables left so we head down to the down stairs bar and we manage to get a table which we take a seat and wait to be served which never happens   mins sat there waiting we give up and head to our room we spent over   for one night with no food at this sort of money you expect more closeness to the o  arena the rooms getting our tea and coffee delivered at breakfast as we were finishing our meal paying to park the car overnight at   should be complimentary for guests very comfortable rooms great breakfast selection some magazines in the spa would have been good there wasn t any milk in the room for tea the drinks were pretty pricey the room was fantastic with views of the thames staff were very attentive the access to the o  was very handy information in the room for facilities ie room service etc maybe forgot to put one in lovely clean rooms excellent bathroom facilities breakfast selection laid out for ease of choice staff very helpful the walk way to the o  wasn t open i have mobility issues and i wonder if the walk had been open whether it would have been a shorter distance as it was the walk around was just over   mins and luckily not raining all the staff were so friendly and helpfull the position of this hotel is exceptional and hotel felt luxurious was unable to visit bar on  th floor after o  concert as it was full at about  pm would have appreciated being able to have a look around even if we were unable to stop and have a drink no positive room which was booked through booking com had view of an air conditioning unit which took up the whole window had to upgrade and pay for another room at a reduced rate ideal for visiting   arena the foyer passage to o  being closed did not mind the walk around as was not raining luxurious feel to the room and very comfortable lovely big windows and light in the room plus view of o  sky bar on   is extortionate views over canary wharf are spectacular but at   a cocktail its a bit steep even by london standards superbly appointed hotel great rooms with all the things a modern traveller would need even usb charging points by the bed finally really comfortable stay and a superb breakfast toono negative from the moment we arrive to the minute we left the service me and my girlfriend received was amazing we visited the   for the ellie goulding concert a few weeks ago literally a stones throw away from the arena which was nice as we were pretty tired from all the drinking and dancing at the concert beds comfy couldn t fault the hotel will visit again cheaper snacks and soft drinks the room was stunning the beds were like sleeping on clouds the tassimo machine was a lovely touch the bathroom spacious spotlessly clean and super modern the staff were incredibly attentive helpful and efficient my son and i have vited it the best hotel we ve ever stayed in the duvet on the bed was way too thick my husband and i spent all night kicking it off because we were just too warm even with the thermostat turned right down breakfast in the morning was a huge disappointment all the hot food was cool and tasted very much like it had all been sat there for an hour or longer even the beans were cold the fried eggs weren t cooked properly and the fried potatoes tastes awful the croissants and muffins were either stale or not defrosted enough and the smoothies and yoghurts both tasted stale your staff also could not advise if the orange juice had sugar or not unhelpful with my husband being diabetic such a shame as the rest of the stay was incredible the view from   and eighteen sky bar is amazing staff were very courteous and friendly and the pool all to ourselves was a bonus they charged me double for the room for some reason ended up taking over   pound from my account after a long phone call they refunded the money but took   working days strange because they tried to do the same to my friend who luckily didn t have enough money for them to take be careful no positiveno negative we liked just about everything about it thank you very much the lady on reception diana charming and very helpful and made us feel very welcome as did all of the staff no negative very comfortable bed spacious modern room and great access to the o  venue breakfast to suit all tastes but most importantly was the staff were fantastic the skybar has panoramic views of canary wharf and relaxed atmosphere no negative polished is the word that comes to mind simply excellent in every way wasn t expecting such a friendly personal service from a large hotel will definitely recommend and visit again the mattress on the bed was severely drooping leaning and hard on one side our stay at the hotel was excellent the breakfast was great and the staff were very helpful the spa was lovely apart from the steam room not being in use special thanks to andrei for his help water not hot enough for a bath revolving front door triggers automatically as you approach in a way that turns an open door into a closed position disabling the option of walking smoothly in tech is great but it has to make things easier not harder similarly for the light switches breakfast too expensive to contemplate good sound proofing despite the niggles overall its position and views are excellent very upset with the lady on duty at the reception a british girl called anne i believe was extremely unprofessional and not helpful all other staff were excellent including supervisors and manager the food room and the two bars and restaurant no negative everything about my one night stay at this hotel was perfect especially the staff who couldn t have been more helpful or welcoming the purpose of my stay was for a concert at the o  and with the hotel having its own private entrance to the arena the location couldn t be bettered i d happily stay here again no negative my daughter and i travelled by train to attend a concert at the o  arena the location of the hotel close to the station and the covered walkway from into the stadium were ideally situated to facilitate this the view from our room was stunning the beds were really comfortable and the staff were friendly and polite i would definitely stay here again breakfast buffet a little ordinary for the price i would expect elements i e eggs to be to order rather than sitting in bain maries proximity to the o  the walk around the o  to get to the hotel as the connection between the o  and hotel was closed partly due to building work the beds were georgeous and have never slept so well the lady on reception was so nice and even organized an upgrade and cake when she found out it was my daughters birthday staff were very attentive my room was double booked when i arrived not a good start it was so easy to just wander to the hotel after my gig didn t have to worry about the massive queues for the underground food drinks are a little on the expensive side lovely hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful rooms were excellent as was the service great views from the bars and restaurant perfect for the o  arena will be staying again only fault i can think of is the cups in the room were too small for the coffee machine very minor detail though it is an excellent hotel excellent location and staff were very helpful and welcoming excellent service throughout our stay you have to validate your parking at reception to get the discounted price of   otherwise you get charged   there was no sign by the car park machine advising of this nor did the staff advise of this at check in was sorted though but needs to be made clearer very good location and reasonable price with good parkingno negative the hotel was beautiful staff where amazing and so attentive i couldn t say a bad word about this hotel any further trips to the o  this will be the hotel we book the breakfast meals were not kept very warm the pre show meal in the peninsula restaurant was fantastic the view from the room up the thames was great all staff were very friendly no suggestions the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay and meal bar service were excellent our room was beautifully clean and comfortable with fantastic views nothing you would be hard pushed to find anything the staff were very welcoming and within five minutes of us being in our room we got a call to ask if we were happy with everything we got an early check in and late check out really lovely details in the room pool and spa both outstanding nothing to complain about at all and   minute walk to the   a real gem hidden out of site the bar was fabulous and we got a window seat looking out across the river and city views would stay here again would be a first choice the bathroom could do with a heated towel rail great location for the o  obviously very friendly polite staff comfortable room with exceptionally comfortable bed fantastic breakfast and really enjoyed cocktails in the sky bar after seeing muse also really liked the pool gym and leisure facilities unclear signage for guests arriving on foot from the underground great location for the o  friendly and helpful staff spacious room good breakfast queue at reception room temperature too high even set at its lowest lack of fresh air was stifling choice of menu items disappointing and cost unjustifiably high mini bar prices must have been a joke didn t have breakfast but how can it be worth thirty pounds per person maybe lobster was on the menu beds were fantastic cleanliness excellent rooms almost faultless the only down fall i could say is the pool was freezing it took all my courage to get in and get swimming we only stayed for one night but during the time we were there the staff were aver so friendly and helpful the room was clean and comfy and the location next to the   and train station made our stay just that more stress free nothing at all excellent facilities clean rooms brilliant location friendly and helpful staff great breakfast choice and quality very good value for money hotel feels a bit isolated from the main streets i liked the usb wall charging ports i enjoyed the tassimo coffee machine in the room breakfast was amazing leaving the hotel was beautiful room was amazing lovely bath tub big tv bed was the most comfy staff friendly fancy lights in the room and incredible views from the room we bought a small glass of wine in the sky bar which cost   which was far too expensive and the service was not particularly good although the views were good it was perfectly situated to see muse at the o  it was a comfortable friendly and efficient hotel with a beautiful view over the river thames the parking was expensive should be at least   pound or free with hotel price waiting for drinks at the bar for awhile but staff very friendly and apologetic the hotel itself service in the clipper bar was slow took over   minutes to order a drink i understand it was an expectionally busy evening however staffing should reflect the amount of residentsno positive in disabled room i couldn t pull the cover off the bed it was too tucked in and i have weak grip but that s only problem comfy bed helpful staff nice food overall great service charge was added to everything even the self serve breakfast buffet redeemed in that my request to remove the charge against breakfast was granted promptly and without kerfuffle new and shiny hotel very comfortable room free bottled water in room helpful and friendly staff nothing everything was fantastic fantastic comfy beds great pillows extra soft stayed in the club lounge great value nothing to much trouble for you excellent customer service would definitely recommend this hotel nothing loved everything everything was amazing staff were excellent and very helpful food was also amazing the view from the room was gorgeous especially at the night the causeway was not opened until  pm and as we had vip hospitality from  pm if it had been a wet eves the walk around to the o  would not have been pleasant and the main reason we booked the hotel was the causeway good room nothing bad to say about this great hotel the staff made our stay as good as it was all were very welcoming and politie but diana at the front desk was particularly fantastic ringing our room to check everything was to our liking and leaving a personal note in our room wishing us a great evening at the concert we were going to the breakfast we had in the morning was also superb and we look forward to our next visit the hotel was not well managed and our room was changed before we had checked out so returning from breakfast we were unable to relax and couldn t use the facilities as intended a complaint bought a poor response breakfast was also chaotic with little control and long queues not what i would expect from a   star hotel location the far we had to walk all the way round to the   maybe if there s and easier way loved the hotel close to the   staff were so friendly and helpful not much the staff were amazing the food was lovely less than   minutes walk from the o  slightly expensive for the price of the room given its only good for the o no negative upon arrival my girlfriend was not happy with the view from our room on the  rd floor so reception kindly upgraded us to a suite on the  th floor with an exceptional view of london and surrounding areas in the morning i d forgotten my swim shorts in la and wanted to use the spa and swimming pool and concierge kindly offered to visit the westfield shopping mall and pick me up a pair in my size outstanding service and very kind polite and friendly my mini bar remained locked so i had no access to the complimentary milk for my morning coffee lovely clean efficient facilities in addition our afternoon tea was perfect service in the terrace bar was a little slow short distance from   and location was quiet room was of an excellent standard with a great view of thames beds really comfortable and the terrace bar has an amazing view in the evening the  st floor bar staff could have been a little more efficient as it took some time to be served   drinks and when served the drinks were incorrect on both occasions everything from the moment we got there was first class and the staff were very polite and helpful the breakfast was lovely and there was plenty of choice the spa pool and sauna were great it will be better when the o  tunnel is opened properly an electric golf car shuttle round to the river boat station would be good for the less mobile guests liz on reception went the extra mile hotel opened the market brasserie an hour early on o  show night to facilitate preshow eating very knowledgeable efficient and helpful doorman marvellous breakfast buffet one of the best i have seen no negative we came for adele s concert at the o  so the hotel s location was very convinient everything is new and very well designed we had an amazing view to the thames the breakfast was superb it s only one station with the riverboat to greenwich no negative excellent facilities fantastic view of river thames from our hotel room free upgrade on early check in very friendly staff extremely comfortable beds room  st class service throughout our stay chose this   star hotel as its so close to o  arena with covered walkway direct to the adele concert we went to that night breakfast next morning well worth it too would highly recommend staying here front of house very poor staff slow so slow check in arrived     queued for checkin after     minutes was told room not ready went for t etc returned to desk at about     but had to repeat registration entry went to room    ish previous request for pillow choice not carried out at     whilst dining in peninsula was tipped off to reserve via dining management so as to secure a spot for   for aftershow nightcap but was refused access cos not on list felt humiliated just simply not good enough for this chain the interior design fittings the bar on the first floor was the most expensive and disorganised facility of it s type i have ever been in it cries out for a professional manager who can react to peaks of activity at these prices you do not expect to wait for   minutes and then get something completely different to what you ordered it was chaotic and really let the hotel down the score would be much higher but for this the hotel was excellent with well trained staff good food and well appointed rooms the stay was too short to test the facilities very slow service in   bar although it was very busy and staff were trying their best location is handy for o  bed was fantastic room very well equipped breakfast lovely snacks with drinks could have been better instead of rice crackers only we really enjoyed our stay and the room service was prompt and more than what i was expecting thank you for making my anniversary even more memorable unfortunately i had an uncomfortable sleep the bed is new and soo hard which was made worse by very soft pillows i tried to phone reception to ask for a different one but no one was available about  midnight we asked at reception at the time of booking in to book a table for the sky bar after our concert but she said we needed to do this from our room by the time we did this less than an hr later we were told they were fully booked when we arrived at the bar around     the   parties before us hadn t booked but were given a table and then when it came to is we had to go to the bar on complaining very politely the staff did everything they could to ensure we had the next table whilst this didn t spoil our stay and i can t thank the lovely ma tre d enough for sorting it out i feel it could have been better organized ie a better booking system in place my only other slight disappointment is that at reception at booking in the lady made out that we couldn t use our debit card to open a tab for mini bar etc as a result we agreed to pay as we went along it meant we had no access to the mini bar which she didn t explain and it also meant that as the milk was in the fridge we didn t have it for coffee in the morning we did ring concierge who said they d arrange to send it up but   mins later it still hadn t arrived so we went for breakfast there was also no information in the room about checking out where and when breakfast was and other things like that i presume that perhaps it was just missing from our room as it seems crazy that there wouldn t be one this information also wasn t given to us at checking in my only real criticism would be breakfast the hot buffett was rather dissapointing whilst my companion enjoyed it i found it was mediocre at best however its important to note that there was a reasonable continental selection and i certainly didn t go hungry excellent customer service very nice hotel and amenities sky bar is a lovely treat lovely room with a great view good price for what we got drinks prices very expensive ok for a treat but at nearly   per drink not likely to have too many service in brasserie very slow but food excellent once it arrives and not too expensive for what it was bed very very comfy staff extremely friendly location for o  perfect no rushing after concert for tube just a short walk   mins and a cocktail overlooking london at night the promised covered walkway to the o  hasn t been built no milk in the room and had to ask for more teabags no instructions for lighting of heating if for using the spa lovely room especially the bathroom and bed staff very good and helpful option of having breakfast tea in room with other complementary drinks is the only thing i could pick up on staff were so polite the moment we arrived room was amazing and overall experience was the best i have had in hotel view of docklands from the bar at night is stunning nothing everything was lovely me friend really enjoyed our stay breakfast included staff lovely frenidly even other guess we better where lovely made the stay even better after the adele concert at o  we went for a drink in the hotel bar but had to wait a while to be served could have done with some extra bar staff sheets and pillows were soft and comfy i didn t like that i couldn t have stayed any longer the receptionist was very polite and helpful he couldn t do enough for us the room was large and comfortable there was nothing more we could have asked for there was everything we could have wanted for breakfast the hotel was very close to the o  we ordered room service for lunch as we we re short on time and found it quite expensive and limited choice but it was delicious this place is fantastic will definitely stay again room and spa facilities outstanding a must if you re visiting the o   th floor cocktail bar was great with fabulous views over canary wharf no negative the hotel interior is luxurious bright airy and modern the rooms are larger than average with super king beds which are extremely comfortable the staff are attentive and there is a good variety of restaurants bars the hotel parking is good value for money and if you are going to a concert at the   then you will love the private walkway in the hotel right adjoined to the   arena breakfast service tea coffee was slow and some minor issues with the room like no milk for the tea coffee facilities so we needed to call down for some a couple of light switches not working and the sink not draining in the bathroom wonderfully comfortable bed very convenient parking and very convenient for the o  no negative excellent location for the o  the staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent the top floor bar is a must at night to take in the view of canary wharf no handbook in the room to tell us how to operate the light switches get wifi work the tv no info re where we were meant to go for breakfast and the times would have been nice to be provided with menus for the various restaurants in the hotel loved that we we were allowed to check in early lovely clean and modern room and bathroom the staff followed through with their promise of a a very tasty and beautifully presented cake for my cousin who was celebrating her  th birthday nice view of the thames very welcoming and helpful concierge staff great location if there for an event at the o  signs to the hotel were not very clear when exiting the station the quick access through the hotel to the o  arena were back in our hotel room within   minutes of the concert finishing better coffee in the room rather go for nespresso that current costa coffee excellent location for attending shows at o  arena excellent service from staff great facilities excellent room service food very comfortable beds and pillows no european power sockets only geared for uk and us guests dinner for   came with   minutes gap at bar waiting   minutes for drinks to come location excellent for o  extensive breakfast with lot of choice spaceous bar that i only stayed for one night the beds were the nicest i have ever slept in the location was amazing the staff were so friendly and so helpful the food was fantastic and not overly priced the rooms were beautifully decorated spa pool closed one day for refurb but we were offered an alternative breakfast was excellent bed was extra large and very comfortable location was perfect and very quiet ideal for the o  arena the reason we booked the intercontinental is the spa facilities and the fact it has a tunnel linked to the o  arena both of these facilities were not available during my stay they were closed due to maintenance by the time i was informed of both closures it was far too late to change hotels or cancel my booking and it was a real let down considering the price paid for the hotel i d recommend to leave booking for a few months whilst the hotel maintenance is being finalised very comfy bed excellent staff amazing breakfast be nice to have breakfast included in price couldn t find a hair dryer either view from window building site sadly bed very comfy staff very friendlyno negative excellent staff service couldn t be more helpful room was very clean with amazingly comfortable bed breakfast buffet was incredible wide range of cooked and uncooked food excellent hotel milk and biscuits in the room i need milk with my coffee and biscuits with my tea milk no milk please just give me milk next time attractive hotel great location great staff minor gripe but there was no milk for the in room coffee maker and housekeeping told me they didn t provide it the covered walkway to the o  was not open either so i had to walk outside to get there breakfast is   staff courteous friendly and helpful room excellent but no hair dryer strangely nothing only disappointment was the link between the hotel and the o  was not open as yet the bed and pillows were like fluffy clouds the room and view were both amazing didn t want to leave no tariff in room for mini bar friendly helpful staff great room with stunning views across london and the thames fab breakfast didn t need to eat again all day the room was very warm and the thermostat wouldn t go below   i didn t report it so the hotel could do nothing about it the hotel was lovely the staff were excellent really helpful friendly and approachable the only fault with our staty was when housekeeping knocked   times to ask when we would be leaving between     when i had a late checkout agreed by  pm the location for the o  is outstanding the hotel has a real wow factor and the staff are very professional and accommodating the room wonderful service and breakfast were a real treat it made our stay in london very special no negative from the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome rebecca was excellent on reception and the concierge was so helpful we will definitely return if we re being really picky after dinner out one night we thought we d order dessert back at the hotel via room service however there wasn t anything on there that we liked maybe expand this menu a little more from what i remember i think there were only     items on the that menu everything was perfect from the room the view and not forgetting the helpfulness of the staff we were given complimentary cable car tickets as the spa was closed for maintenance chauffeur driven unexpectedly to our dinner booking across the river and when we arrived by car to the hotel the ticket machine wasn t working for the car park we notified reception when we checked in was advised they would sort out the fee when we check out thinking they would charge our credit card or something when we checked out we were given a complimentary pre paid ticket free of charge so we could get through the car park barrier again unexpectedly we were there for   nights breakfast was also amazing lovely views of the thames eat as much or as little as you want the skybar is lovely too again amazing views was very relaxing with complimentary nibbles we really did feel like vip s during our stay someone could of taken our bags up customer service was excellent me and my wife felt very welcomed also the staff took the opportunity to wish us blessings on our new marriage no negative excellent services very nice clean room comfy bed tasty breakfast and gorgeous bar the cocktails in the sky bar are amazing the staff is very friendly and helpful there was no natural ventilation windows that open and the room was stuffy despite asking for maintenance to adjust the air conditioner to make it cooler located right at the o  for my a ha concert breakfast was amazing i left my james bond outfit at home for the weekend and felt that we were snubbed a little as a result we were also disturbed twice in the afternoon when we were trying to have a little nap breakfasts were amazing room brilliant and all within   minutes of the o  nothing really if i did need to comment about what i didn t like the location is a bit out of the way but perfect for the   service and staff excellent if i had to be picky i was slightly disappointed the covered walkway through to the o  arena wasn t open yet but it s not the hotel s fault it hadn t been finished the arena end that is really picky though as actually the whole experience was perfect all was exceptional particularly the staff their customer service skills were amazing and not just the odd one but everyone we came in to contact with rooms are lovely fabulous bathrooms beautifully decorated bars are both lovely and the breakfast was stunning i honestly can t think of anything that could be improved nothing the staff were very accommodating and friendly immaculate room with a wonderful view and everything you could need the breakfast was very good quality i would recommend to anyone excellent stay slightly awkward to walk to from the o  but i understand building work is ongoing and it will become easier beautiful room lovely staff incredible breakfast couldnt fault anything really if being really picky there could be a short cut to   maybe rather than walking all the way around and ahower could get hotter everything absolute top knotch hotel staff couldnt be more helpful and rooms spacious and modern breakfast amazing bed amazing no negative the staff were exceptional we had a very warm welcome as we arrived at the hotel and from liz on reception all of the staff were professional and genuinely friendly throughout our stay walk way to the o  not yet open so you had to walk all the way round the hotel to get to o  entrance breakfast menu very expensive bed very comfy lovely room with great views i ordered some ice for drinks in our room before going out and it never got delivered the location was superb the hotel is right next to the o  arena it will be even better when the walkway is opened the hotel is luxurious and the staff are all really friendly polite and courteous we got a free upgrade to a river view room and the room itself was fantastic with a huge comfortable bed i loved the control panel by the door for controlling the air con do not disturb etc i also loved the fact that you could use night lights if you didn t wanted to be blinded by light in the small hours we had a massive tv in the room which was highly interactive i paired up my iphone and was able to view videos on youtube streamed to the tv from my phone there was also a bose speaker in the bathroom breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of hot food and continental breakfast the waiting staff were really attentive and nothing was too much trouble we ll definitely stay here again did not realise i had not booked breakfast at     for   adults and   albeit older children staff friendly swimming pool and good air con plus views brilliant nothing everthing especially the staff they should teach other hotels what a good customer service is all about every signal staff was welcoming smiling and will do anything to make the guest happy we only stayed there for   nights to attend a concert for adele but you can tell good service when you see it would of liked some milk with the tea facilities in the room staff were wonderfully attentive and polite nothing was too much trouble the free wi fi is always welcome at these hotels and the location to the o  is great the sky bar on floor   is a must as it has a brilliant view across the thames hotel very quiet so the staff slightly over attentive eg was asked four times by four different staff if we were enjoying our breakfast not a big issue just a bit much while eating excellent new hotel fantastic location excellent facilities fantastic standard of buffet breakfast some switches didn t always work properly the door knob of the shower cabin is quite sharp to the hands the door closes firmly so you need some force to open it light in the bathroom could be a little brighter breakfast was outstanding fresh fruits fresh orange juice good espresso food never runs out not even at     when breakfast time ends all staff was very polite especially the mister helping us with our suitcases mohamed and the lady at the reception jennifer and all the staff in the restaurant room was tidy with a great view fohn and iron included it was silent too good isolation soft drinks where priced quite high the bed was beautifully comfortable i didn t want to get up from it the spa was also amazing most relaxed i ve felt for a long time thanks intercontinental absolutely nothing this hotel is something very special the staff treated us like vips which we re not from the moment we walked up to the entrance to the moment we left the room was beautiful with the biggest most comfortable bed i think i ve ever slept in the walkway wasn t open to the o  yet but the hotel laid on a shuttle service however to save us waiting the very nice concierge called claudio drove us there personally in a bmw after the concert we had a drink in the bar on the  th floor overlooking the river and the lights at night a magical end to a magical stay thank you to what i think is one of the best hotels in london no negative everything from the moment we arrived was first class and all the staff were very welcoming and helpful also amazing views from both the rooms and bars the tunnel from hotel to o  was closed without notice when we had booked this hotel for that very reason due to a painful knee injury walking around to the o  only took   minutes however i was upset that the staff did not seem too bothered by my concern and about the extra pain i suffered which could have been avoided huge king bed in a standard double room gorgeous hotel close to o  incredible breakfast nothing it was over performing in every respect perfect for any o  event new and well run you need look no further for the right place to camp before and after a performance not an efficient service in the skybar had to wait for over  mins for the bill and when it came it was wrong had to pay the service charge as included on the bill yet poor service faulty coffee machine in the room views large comfortable bed location to o  great breakfast there was no milk in the room for tea and i had to send for some however it arrived pretty quickly there could have been more normal tea bags too many herbals for us the most important aspect of this hotel was its location how come it has taken so long for someone to think about building a hotel next to the o  in addition the hotel was excellent the service fantastic and breakfast amazing we have stayed at hotels that purport to be   but this one really was   no information booklet in the room to advise of the facilities available small point but there were no biscuits cookies to accompany the good selection of tea coffee in the room provided an ice bucket but had to phone room service to get ice as there is no ice making machine on the communal floor area the room had great views and the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them great location right next to the o  arena and walking distance from the tube station the spa area and gym are really well equipped and very clean probably one of the best we have used anywhere nothing the staff were brilliant easy check in valet parking spa amazing the rooms are superb with great views eighteen sky bar has got some amazing views great location for the o  with the tube and clipper a   minute walk away no milk in room for coffee tea unless you pay for it out of the mini bar location perfect for our visit to see adele at the o  clean room would stay here again no hairdryer overall a brilliant but short stay with a lovely young irish at reception just wanted to compliment one young lady in particular whose name is pheobe she was very courteous pleasant and took time to make sure all our needs were met thank you not a crtiscm nor really an issue but might be an idea to have secure access gate for guests on route to pier staff were brilliant couldn t have been more attentive but not in your face very customer focussed super impressed great breakfast choices the lack of staff rudeness of a member of female staff german lady unable to get served a drink beautiful room excellent location hotel manager james was brilliant sorting out an issue key didn t work on arrival so we had to go back down   floors to reception receptionist accent very difficult to understand no night time turn down despite light on requesting room attendant breakfast service dreadful asked for table by window offered   other tables first by buffet finally got our window table several available all the time staff did not understand english we had to point out our orders on the menu and they still got them wrong my husbands juice took   minutes to arrive staff looked very nervous  st day for most good variety for breakfast but scrambled eggs cold and tasteless great views room spacious comfy bed lovely bathroom the service was a little slow in the clipper bar when there wasn t that many people in there at  pm at night but the staff again were friendly i only stayed one night so not long enough to use all the facilities my only other slight dislike is the price of breakfast and hence why i went else where but i know that these are the standard prices the location was exactly what i wanted the room was comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful with on site parking i would use these facilities again long queues to check in and staff avoiding eye contact refused entry to the skybar after the adele concert because i hadn t booked a table when i checked in no one told me i needed to book check your bill i was charged   extra for breakfasts     discretionary service charge automatically added to bills there were only two of us and i would have preferred to decide on a tip receptionist handed over key cards but didn t say where lifts restaurants spa etc were located new hotel close to the   some staff extremely helpful and friendly hotel was very clean concierge staff were fantastic the milk for tea and coffee was in the locked mini bar and it took   calls and a couple of hours to get some milk hotel was spotless staff all of them were a pleasure to interact with nothing was too much trouble loved the bar on the  th floor and at night the view was spectacular so close to the o  no milk unless you either pay a large deposit for the mini bar or call reception when you wanted to make tea not ideal first thing in the morning covered walkway to the o  not available atm which was disappointing given the cost of the room and no advance warning that this was the case lighting in the bedroom was great beds extremely comfy feeling of luxury amazing view across the thames nothing to dislike that i could fine the facilties were excellient the breakfast buffet outstanding the staff were so helpful nothing was to much trouble well done to everyone no mention of spa not being totally functional sauna etc not working the point of choosing the hotel was two friends and a spa day as well as the overnight near o  lovely staff so helpful especially diana the white wine we ordered in the skyline bar was red the view from our spacious and comfortable room was amazing it added to what was an excellent weekend wrote to the hotel via booking com about an early check in did not get a response don t know whether it is the fault of booking com or the hotel asked for an early check in got an early check in no fuss had to wait for  mins for bottle opener tone delivered to room then member of staff came opened bottle of wine for me then went away with bottle opener had to call down to reception ask if they could leave one in room my daughters too was the same room just didn t seem to be organised with basic items had to wait     mins for eggs benedict to be made at breakfast service is very poor near o  venue the breakfast was not included in our stay and was not offered after booking we chose an a la carte breakfast of just   poached eggs bacon one slice and toast one slice we were then informed it would be cheaper to go for the   full english breakfast even though there was nothing else we wanted seemed a huge amount to pay as this was all we ate probably our most expensive breakfast in terms of what we ate the waiter then got our breakfast from the buffet   minutes after ordering it the poached eggs tasted of vinegar and there was too much soft fat on the bacon some of the waiting staff spoke little english upon leaving we paid for all our sundries and were then expected to pay parking when i booked a few months ago parking was included in the cost of the hotel and was told that the terms had later changed this had to be waived location was excellent for the o  and the bar on the  th floor was amazing in terms of its views the room was comfortable and clean the walk way from the hotel to the o  wasn t open the o  still doing work there side we feel we should have been informed about this before we arrived had to walk round to get to the main entrance now this isn t far but if i didn t take some sensible shoes and coat it was very cold this could have been a problem right next door to the o  hotel is really nice lovely views had lunch in hotel that was very good but was a bit expensive we booked because your web site said the hotel has a direct covered walk way into the o  arena for adele concert we were attending however it wasn t open i complained to christina in customer relations at the hotel and she arranged a complimentary cab but we had to walk back outside late at night our only complaint no positive indoor connection to o  arena is not yet finished but only a   minute walk around outside staff could not have been kinder conveniently located near the tube for easy access just a few train stops into the city to sightsee and such as well as easy access to the o  arena the adele concert was the main reason for my visit additionally plenty of places to dine coffee convenience store at within the o  drinks a bit pricey in the clippers bar from the moment you walk through the revolving doors you know your somewhere special staff were so friendly and helpful from the hotel to the o  without going outside is perfect cable car over thames river taxi tube station and bus station are all on the doorstep it was advertised as having a covered walkway directly into the   arena unfortunately on arrival i discovered it was still under construction this was the main reason i chose this hotel as a solo traveller there was a good selection of coffee but no ordinary breakfast tea only green tea fruit tea i like a good ordinary cuppa had to buy teabags at local tesco having said all this i cannot fault the hotel it was excellent good location very clean i think the covered walkway will be an added bonus when completed i will definitely stay here again lovely new hotel very friendly welcome cleanliness was superb bed was so comfortable with very high quality bed linen had a wonderful sleep close to   underground station the walkway between hotel and o arena was not open the following day it would have been much more convenient than the walk around the block the hotel is new and very comfortable the spa area is fabulous the staff are welcoming friendly and efficient the rooms are spacious and well furnished the views from the hotel across the river and london are breath taking there is a walkway between the hotel and the o  arena on event nights my wife felt the room was too hot although this didn t bother me i couldn t seem to get the aircon to make the room any cooler the location is superb and the service is sublime view certain part it is like a building site i don t care wifi even know it s free but it s slow can t actually use it pay parking for hotel guests not quite what i expected river view was ok otherwise building site looking like ceiling to floor window which i like clean breakfast is good staff are polite helpful     location next to o  if u come for show ie good stuff free wifi nice and modern there was nothing to not like the pillows were so comfortable your head just sinks into them the standard of the hotel was fantastic i would recommend it to anyone not just visiting the o  but visiting london in general small details were disappointing ie no milk two days running and newspaper forgotten unable to get car out of barrier all the big things were great standard and cleanliness of the hotel staff pool and spa area position bedding amazing walkway not yet open to o  but not their fault had to request additional tea coffee great location and when the staff heard it was my birthday they had a cake delivered to my room which was a nice touch the shower in our room was not great the water ran all over the bathroom from the wet area and the main shower head sprayed in all sorts of directions and was not very powerful without exception all the staff we met were fantastic polite professional friendly and helpful the breakfast was excellent with a good range of good quality well prepared food the room was amazingly quiet could hear no other guests or any traffic outside the window no negative very comfortable hotel ideal location for   and london city excellent breakfast very friendly and efficient staff could not rate this hotel highly enough and will be staying with them againno negative location was fantastic rooms were clean with a great view over the thames breakfast was also excellent with a great selection and good service brand new complimentary pool spa facilities were an added bonus we ordered room service the fries were warm rather than hot and came without vinegar that is my only little negative comment all staff from front of house to the chambermaids were pleasant and extremely helpful the promised direct access to o  had not been completed yet was not me tinned anywhere and even advertised as a selling point as stay was for   days of c c at the o  this was a disappointment especially as could not get access to hotel for overnight and hour at the end due to massive queue for public transport luckily weather was good for the extra long way round location views decor and service attention all top notch gteat new addition to the o  offer and for london travellers with exvellent public transport next door will definitely book next year again and look forward to direct access to o  by then as promised i would have liked to see an offering of gluten free bread and or vegan options for breakfast eg soya yoghurt or veggie sausages if you are looking for luxury this is the hotel for you the staff were incredibly attentive the location was literally next door to the o  arena the food was beautiful i couldn t find fault it s the small things so here i go walkway to o  closed no milk in room and no it s wasn t in the mini bar lack of signage finding reception isn t easy no bottle opener in room so put the cold beers back that really is all i can fault but a nuisance staff awesome decor stunning location brilliant the water temperature in the bathroom was erratic which was annoying the food was good but expensive the staff in the  th floor bar were not particularly helpfull possibly a minor management problem the staff else where were excellent friendly but very efficient overall we enjoyed our stay and would come again no positive bed was a little too firm but that s just personal preference very well looked after by all staff made to feel welcome and staff were attentive and gave as much time as we needed instructions in the room on how to use the coffee machine we had to call down to reception in the end for help on turning it on also only one choice of coffee americano would have preferred more choice as do not like strong ciffee the reception staff in particular were  st class they couldn t do enough to show how important we were as guests at their hotel air con did not work hot and extremely uncomfortable in room some teething problems as hotel not been opened for too long no direct walk through to o  as advertised bed comfy bathroom nice and clean good location for the o  excellent breakfast but not the cheapest o  walk way wasn t available as under construction we were attending an event at the   but were not made aware of this prior to booking couldn t get a parking space had to park at the o  parking then walk to the hotel then had a space available had to walk back to the car to re park after discussing with the manager friendly reception staff lovely hotel very clean good location room too cold air conditioning unit doesn t go high enough to remedy this no instructions for the coffe machine or price list for mini bar items big comfy bed generous breakfast well worth the money no negative the staff were very friendly and helpful the   th floor sky bar is a must especially on night time view is stunning breakfast was beautiful plenty selection and fresh hotel and rooms themselves fantastic bottle of water on the top near kettle got charged mini bar prices which should have been made clear   deposit on arrival should be made clear when booking shocking to recieve money back   business days after departure we loved how close it was to the o  arena and the underground room was spotless and staff were so friendly easy check out which was fab and really flexible with the check in and out times spa was amazing too a few issues over the lights in the room had to call for an electrician no bottle opener for the bar very very slow service at the bar especially after the ufc fight waited   minutes for three beers even after several reminders steam room and jacuzzi not operating most pleasant staff very comfortable rooms unfortunately my partner and his friends stayed here and i paid for the hotel as a treat for his birthday i went with the more expensive option which included breakfast in the room rate they were told breakfast hadn t been paid for so i paid a grand total of     for absolutely nothing no positive cooked breakfast food options need to be much warmer a real shame however there were some great choices of food on offer and loved the smoothies fantastic location for the o  no transport stress to worry about after an event great bars on both the  st and  th floors and incredibly comfy beds as we were not going to be in the hotel for more than   hours we decided against leaving a credit card against the room the mini bar was locked because of this in the morning we made a cup of coffee with the superb little machine in the room only to find our milk was locked in the mini bar not a major problem but just an observation this was a very easy hotel to stay at the car parking was plentiful and easy to locate checking in was easy staff made you very welcome and were always there to help at the time of our visit the linking tunnel to the o  itself was closed so we had to track around the outside in cold and wet to concert getting back to the hotel you then stop caught up in all the crowds and it took ages to return the pool was also not open so the review is based on a hotel that promised so much but was let down by the non opening of facilities advertised as open that would have made the stay perfect right next to the o  the place is new and stylish great views from the plush bar because the hotel is brand new there were a few tiny little things such as   door key and   tv not working however the staff were absolutely brilliant at sorting these things out they were all wonderful and made our stay very comfortable and enjoyable big thanks to all the team we had   rooms as we were taking my mother in law to the o  for her  th birthday treat the staff were wonderful making a real fuss of her they brought her out a selection of free cakes after our lunch and because the connecting walkway to the arena was not ready yet and she has mobility issues they laid on a complimentary taxi to and from the show on our return to the room she wasn t able to climb onto the beautiful big bed so they brought up a smaller bed for her and made it up within   minutes priceless that the walk through to the o  was closed not finished reason i booked hotel very wet and windy   minute walk round to o  transport could have been provided on a dry day it would have been no problem breakfast was good lots of choices and lovely staff to assist you especially lovely phoebe shame that the private access into the o  wasn t open yet when it is that s the cherry on top lovely room with very large comfy bed top notch bathroom and a great view couldn t fault it loved the late check out more information if the facilities in the room there was no information folder and while you could look up on the tv the info was limited eg no info on the spa location brilliant gor the o  all the staff were courteous and helpful i would prefer for the twin room to have two beds rather than a kingsize bed with two separate mattresses bed really comfy lovely breakfast the sky bar has wonderful views no negative i stayed here with my partner over valentine s weekend lovely new and modern hotel nothing was a problem very helpful staff and great facilities the pricing on the food the bed was very comfy and i love the speakers in the shower from the tele was all connected and the views were spectacular only the price for a non flex stay it s   per nite and i do think that is on the expensive side although i absolutely feel they gave my mum the   treatment and am not complaining the front of house concierge team were absolutely fantastic from initial greeting to last goodbye this overnight trip was a present for my mum and her friend both of whom are close to   they were treated like royalty no question was too much and i feel the whole team including the bar staff in the sky bar went out of their way to make them feel special mum sent me a text to say they felt like vip s and they couldn t sleep because they were so excited the beds were fab the room and view were just perfect and the whole experience was beyond anything we could have imagined i have tweeted three times to the hotel and their ceo to express our gratitude my sister and i staying in march i cant wait finding someone else s personal invitation in our room no english tea had to ask only fruit tea in the room no mini bar price list and why on earth are pringle style black tubes in the fridge containing a phone charger and another one containing condoms no hotel info pack had to look on the tv bath water was luke warm not hot bath plug was difficult to open toilet plumbing was poor shower pressure was poor breakfast layout was disorganised walkway between the o  and hotel was closed blood spots on the bed linen the bar on the  th floor attitude of the staff the walkway to the arena but it will be completed soon so no real complaint the views over the river were fantastic staff were very helpful and were always ready to help it s one of the best hotels i have stayed in the next time we come to london it s the hotel we would book the breakfast room service could have been lots better there were items of food i had ordered which were missing and the food was lukewarm at best particularly the toast very costly for what you actually get the bed was comfy the space of the room was more than adequate and the bathroom was very nice and luxurious would of been nice if the walkway to the o  was open saves us getting rained on but it s only a     minute walk around the outside of the hotel to get there so not a massive problem at all everything this hotel was just amazing the staff were very attentive polite and welcoming the beds were very comfortable loved the shower all the facilities were brilliant the hotel was spotless thank you for a lovely stay will be back for sure we attempted to go up to the hotels bar late into the evening we were stopped by the bar manager and told the bar was full in an act of defiance i explained that at these prices i expected to have access to the hotels bar my friend and i entered anyway to find a bar so unbusy i wondered what the bar managers benchmark was for full we were served immediately and found seats not great service for a   a night hotel ambience fantastic and location for our purposes brilliant breakfast was also fantastic we were made to feel unwelcome and out of place i felt embarrassed and angry as i was with my mum i don t appreciate that behaviour my mum is disabled and we had to park in the event parking area as the hotel parking was reserved for the bmw event staff couldn t tell us how to get from the car park to the hotel and we ended up walking for a long time with bags where i struggled let alone my mum i mentioned that we were going to be late to the nitro circus event as it is a fair walk around and was there a quicker way but was just told that no my disabled mum and i would have to walk all the way back around no empathy or care given there was no milk to have tea in the room and so phoned reception they said they would be up shortly with milk but never turned up room was lovely and clean my stay was a suite of bad experiences waiting   mn to have the room service menu in my room movie ordered on pay tv not working fire alarm in the middle of the night and no fire and a breakfast ordered in my room that never came though ai asked reception that never called me back and as a cherry on the cake when i asked very politely to speak to a manager upon check out she did not come though she was at   meters what a poor attitude very large rooms and cunfortable beds there was nothing to dislike it was a friendly nice warm welcome the room was lovely and clean staff were friendly and helpful at all time enjoyed everything about my stay there will be coming again there was no room service menu in outer room and we had to ask for it twice and the price of mini bar items was not available in the room breakfast was buffet style with the option of having eggs cooked to your liking i was told repeatedly that my eggs would be   minute and after   minutes i gave up just a couple of teething problems for a newly opened hotel drinks in the hotel are extremely expensive lovely room clean and modern stunning views from the sky bar and great location for visiting the o  view walkway to   and lower the prices a little brilliant bed room but poor view especially as i had booked so far in advance beautiful hotel but walkway into hotel still not finished will be a great hotel when it is finished still some great things in the pipeline got exactly what i expected for the price food and drink were expensive but you expect this from this type of hotel you really do not want to know didn t try the croissants bed was very comfortable shame the room was only serviced once during a three night stay it would have been nice to have the option of a brighter light in the bedroom and the mugs were a little small for the amount of coffee dispensed from the coffee machine but nothing major the bedroom was spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable we were amazed how quiet the hotel was we didn t hear a sound the staff were very polite and helpful staff in the sky bar while very friendly were too officious people looking to enjoy a drink and a chat do not need micro managing being told what table to sit at in a half empty bar constantly being asked if we need anything the chairs set at the tables for two are too far apart for comfortable conversation coffe machine in room needs instructions it took two staff members over   minutes to work out how to use it great location comfortable room with a lovely spacious bathroom excellent breakfast my room view wasn t great but i was only on the  th floor i would imagine the higher the nicer view we used this hotel as it said it was located right next to the o  arena yes it was but it was a long walk to the entrance and reception from the o  some signs would have been helpful too more info in room would also have been helpful like room service info and what time food is served etc where the dining room was located etc i loved the stunning views from the bar on the  th floor the breakfast was spot on and lots of choice when i booked it said it had its own walkway into the   arena but when we got there they hadn t opened it yet which they should have put on there website the hotel was beautiful could not fault it the fact that we paid for this hotel believing that all the facilities were open only to find that the spa etc wasn t in use and that this was only in the small print something that big should have been put somewhere noticeable the staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for you the bed was very comfortable and room size was excellent service in the meridan lounge was a little slow facilities and a room excellent and extremely comfortable bed and an excellent breakfast everyone catered for the eighteen sky bar is brilliant few teething problems with a new hotel but the manager was brilliant and didn t want us to leave with any bad feelings he didn t make us feel bad when we mentioned the problems we had and solved everything so we were more than happy and will return asap beautiful room with luxurious beds hotel is gorgeous with a great view over the thames staff very friendly and helpful breakfast was wonderful great location for the o  arena fantastic manager carnt fault the hotel but was little disappointed that the spa an gym wasn t open yet as we booked it thinking it was open but apart from that loved everything about it will defo stay again staff was very helpfully to no positiveno negative i liked how welcoming and helpful all the staff were and how close we were to access public transport when needed and eating out places were a stone through away hotel was very clean would definitely recommend this hotel and would come back here also so convenient when visiting the o  arena the staff were very off was made to feel uncomfortable more than once and the bar staff took half an hour to serve me and my friend had that drink and went straight to bed they were that rude would not recommend this hotel based on the staff the location was brilliant the bar service in the skybar was extremely slow it took us   mins to get a drink all the staff seemed to be serving the tables and no one serving at the bar graham the bellboy was brilliant very helpful and he also took us around to show us where everything was we had a member of staff come into our room whilst we were in the middle of getting dressed he opened the door without knocking and got an eyeful of my partner in her underwear we told member of staff in the lobby about the incident and she was very shocked to hear this had happened and a gesture of good will she reserved us a table in the sky lounge for after the event at the o  and it was the best table in there looking over the centre of canary wharf the complimented us with a couple of free drinks to soften what happened and in all fairness they really went out of there way to make us feel better about the incident which we both agreed did help and worked all of this aside if i were to go to another event in the o  i will more than likely stay again lovely hotel brilliant location for our trip to the o  arena staff were very helpful when we had an issue with our room being entered by a member of staff when we were half dressed getting ready to go out made to feel extra comfortable after the incident the staff managed brilliantly considering it was there first time if there being a big event at the o  and having an awful lot of guests for the first time bar was chaotic probably early opening problems nothing major just took a long time to get drinks and had to repeat the order a lot of times however the bar is really expensive great location excellent staff especially at check in disappointed with the service in the sky bar at night although it was busy as the clipper bar is not open yet i do however think that hotel residents should be a priority otherwise all the hard work from the checkin staff is wasted if both bar and waiter service is operated in sky bar staff need to ensure customers are served promptly or asked to take a seat and a waiter take the orders we waited too long for service both at the bar and for waiter service hopefully this will be improved when hotel fully open the staff were excellent on check in and out gabrielle was very friendly and helpful the only thing i would have liked is if breakfast was included the hotel is very lovely but for the price we paid i wouldve liked a brekkie thrown in every single staff memeber we met were extremely friendly and attentive they made our stay very comfortable the hotel had only been opened   weeks and was spotless rooms were very nice given they haven t finished it off yet it looks a little untidy outside but once complete i am sure this will be superb no hotel guide to tell you what is where and when it s open but again maybe they were waiting for these to be printed directions signage from the tube station would be helpful drinks are expensive so bring extra cash or a bigger credit limit on your card the staff were really friendly and couldn t do more to help hotel made us feel super special and the room with the river views was awesome the hotel is very new and there are some teething issues our table was given away at breakfast despite having left only to get food the bar in the evening although busy had a   min turnaround from drinks order to arrival the room was very comfortable and the in room services we excellent unfortunately the spa and sky bar was not yet ready to be opened so a bit disappointed we couldn t use them the room and hotel was amazing was lovely nothing loved the stay and would definitely again when i visit the o  ever so friendly rooms immaculate used a couple of things from the min bar and one was stale but was taken off the bill with no arguments or issues excellent customer service eighteen bar is stunning and being told by staff to make sure we visit we did bar opened at  pm we decided to have a drink before our dinner reservation at  pm and to check out the fabulous views unfortunately we were still waiting   minutes later despite tellling the waitress twice after we had ordered a cocktail and a beer and so we had to leave without having them a great disappointment as the bar wasn t very full either whereas the service we received in clipper bar earlier was excellent we received no apology which was a little disappointing beautiful hotel excellent staff eva and when all the facilities are available it will be amazing although we did not have the breakfast the prices for the breakfast was fairly high   for a breakfast or lower depending on what you ended up having i thought that was a little too high although i must admit the breakfast and restaurants did look amazing the hotel staff were excellent and the hotel was truly   stars the rooms are very comfortable and roomy and very clean the hotel has all mod cons built in the tv s are excellent with showing most common channels including bt sports     the sky bar on the  th floor is just amazing the views over the thames and of canary wharf was simply stunning the hotel is right next to the o  and you can see the dome roof right next to the hotel it is amazing nothing the hotel was fantastic every thing was spot on from the reception we had from first walking in from sima the porter then getting our room was fast with lots of info about the hotel the room was lovely with a bed that was so comfy i didn t want to leave the food was fantastic the pan fried salmon very enjoyable the views are the best the bar on the  th floor not to be missed fantastic views of canary wharf wow thank you to pheobe for making breakfast enjoyable with lovely service and very pleasant thank you to graham the doorman for the tour of the hotels great ballroom what a fantastic place he was very interesting to talk to and looked after us when leaving liz was very helpful

this hotel     absolutely stunning all staff was excellent perfect location will be going back again would definitely recommend no negative location perfect for the o  unfortunately we were the  th guest to arrive and the hotel was a soft opening and some of the facilities were unavailable but from what we could see it looks fantastic the staff could not do enough rooms are large and comfortable the walkway to the o wasnt finished so had to walk luckily it wasn t raining immaculate hotel although not finished staff were very helpful and happy avery perfect place to stay because it was so new the spa was not open yet when we arrived the hotel had only been open  hrs brand new the staff were very attentive and friendly the bars restaurant were gleaming and the room was to die for very clean

hotel and they did even give an explanation or get a manager to speak to me closeness to o  nothing the hotel was lovely clean and fresh the rooms are spacious and modern the beds were to die for and breakfast was amazing paying     for the car parking as a guest at the hotel this should be included free the staff were great and the hotel was very clean there were only   normal tea bags in the room and not many milk sachets could have done with more the staff were very friendly the fact we had to pay for the internet there was no wifi that we were able to have the breakfast brought to the room nothing to sat all staff were extra helpful breakfast offered a lot of choice which is great with kids very clean and tidy hotel would stay againno negative the bed and room super comfy very nice

free the view from our window was breath taking both during the day especially at night no negative having direct access route to the o  was great as the reason we stayed here was for a concert at the

perfect rooms were comfortable and the service throughout the hotel was outstanding will definitely stay again thank you having to move rooms twice though the night due to workmen and noise not getting to our beds until     in the morning hotel and staff were pov eyno negative this hotel was lovely very helpful staff lovely for a get away or to stay after an event at the   arena no negative my husband and i were traveling as a part of our honeymoon and the room was provided with bottle of wine chocolates and more thank you very much for all your hospitality efficiency and reactivity of staff shower layout was not comfortable at all no door and therefore the whole bathroom becomes messy we asked for high story room we got the one on gf i couldnt found something suitable for me to eat the night of my arrival i informed the room service that i dont eat meat being vegeterian got chicken in my salad no positiveno negative excellent breakfast the staff was the best so friendly and helpful perfect location steps to the eiffel tower the concierge did everything for us got us tickets to all sites in the city the staff in the breakfast area was very poorly trained many plates were broken during our breakfast in one seating noises was all over the place seemed like they didnt careno positiveno negative this was a stylish hotel which was both relaxed and friendly the staff had exceptional customer service they were friendly helpful competent and efficient we loved our stay here rooftop terrace not available it was nice overall we weren t there very long but we re disappointed that the rooftop terrace was not available staff very friendly and helpful and rooms nice bath room the entrance to shower is very narrow the sink looks good but not functional darkness not enough light electrical wall outlets located not for tourists who need to charge cameras and phones they are located under the table between windows without places to put your phones and cameras design comfortable bed breakfast location and people working thereno negative the service is exceptional the beds are super comfortable the food is fantastic this is the best hotel in paris you can walk to the eiffel tower and stop at some lovely caf s the staff is very helpful and provide restaurant recommendations there is a design fault with the bathroom sink if the water tap is slightly turned on then it is ok when at mid way point the water splashes over the sink on to the floor or the person could ruin a silk outfit the breakfast was very good and fresh with excellent service on arrival and departure the reception was highly efficient rooms were nicely furnished a hotel i would recommend without doubt location was very good only complaint was it was my new wife and i were on honeymoon i emailed ahead a few times about getting some champagne and stuff in the room for our arrival and got no reply and there was a questionnaire before arrival that asked reason of stay i put honeymoon and we were put in a twin room it was lovely but not ideal the staff were excellent and a hot option with breakfast was good perfect central location for walking distance to everything i liked it all great staff very warm greeting when we arrived always very friendly when we were coming or going minutes from eiffel tower great location near rue clar as a bonus the room was extra small we called booking com to cancel last   days of one room which they did and helped us supposedly at no charge but that room now was charged   euros more breakfast was now included and awful and our relatives did not want the front desk person was not nice and was quite rude maybe because we were americans the second room was nice and the manager helped us with that we would stay there again now that we know what to expect the bed was nice breakfast was over rated and too expensive room was way to small but they did upgrade us after   days manager was very nice tried to accommodate need to make the atmosphere a bit more vibrant as my mrs had to request for some music to liven the atmosphere up when we arrived our toilet seat was too close to the wall and hot radiator a swimming pool will be nice staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome bed was very comfortable and feels really nice breakfast was nice too hotel location is close to most major tourist attractions in paris within walking distance nice and quiet neighbourhood the view from our room was poor and the pillows not very comfortable the hotel is a bit pricey however in line with the market the comfort and the cleanliness of the room the bed was big and the mattress very comfy the breakfast was very diverse and tasty with fresh exotic fruits and freshly squeezed juices the bathroom is very modern and clean finally the staffs were very helpful nice hotel the first room we got was very small and the next one the bathroom was dirty the   room was great so what they say all good things come in three the reception was super friendly however the breakfast stuff was unacceptable she did not speak english and gave you the feeling you are not welcome you had to ask for everything as the buffet was empty no bread cheese etc not what you expect from a first class hotel nice hotel small rooms and too dark need to add more lights especially the furniture are dark and no light even in morning i have to open the bathroom door to get more lights need more security especially in the elevator area which takes you to the rooms doors are opened any one can enter the floors and no security are availableno positive the breakfast was quite disappointing all the good stuff was gone when we got there at  am room was awesome especially the bathroom and bed the staff was really sweet except during the breakfast room was really dark the interior architect was not practical minded in the least faucets drenched you when turning on water you banged yourself getting out of bed on one side also due to no light location the room service is not good enough for a   star hotel and she doesn t clean glasses for   days in row room is very clean and pillows very nice and soft the location of hotel was very good this hotel did not offer the   experience i was expecting the room was extremely small and there was a very small closet in the room which barely was able to fit my suit the sauna is at best a   person sauna and that is stretching it they even charged us for the coffee in the lobby while we waited i am not sure why this hotel is rated as   star this was a standard   or maybe a     star experience the location of this hotel is excellent the staff was friendly and very accommodating only a few good restaurants near the hotel no free bottle of water is provided low speed wifi in the room they have mondern and beautiful salon with bar very kind staffs located in calm area it is good to sleep no turn down service you need to ask for it many times complementary water as well you have to ask juliana is in a residential neighborhood arr   very boutique hotel i guess     rooms very luxury however very small great value for money only one minor fault it was missing the complemntary bottle of water that the receptionest noticed and said they would bring one up which never happened lovely hotel room nothing all good the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful it was a great location and our room was wonderful the breakfast buffet was delicious we hope to come back some day there was a problem with the safe in the room   and   hours after reporting it no one had been to the room i ended up being moved to another room i loved the pillow and the shower no room service after mid night no laundry facilities inside the hotel no mirrors in the room lighting is very poor in the room tiny gym the modern and beautiful furniture clenn and comfort bed friendly staff our stay was adequate but there are some serious issues with customer service firstly i was nearly charged for an early check in when i simply asked for my partner s name to be added to the booking not an early check in time secondly we asked on six separate occasions for a larger size of slipper on every occasion we were told they were on their way immediately and they never arrived and i was there for four nights if no larger sizes were available it would have been polite to inform me of this instead of ignoring my request every time thirdly the bath plug was broken and the sink tap was faulty so we had to change rooms just an hour after arriving and unpacking the bed was very comfy water was not draining properly in the shower so had to stop the shower twice before finishing my shower problem reported to the maid but nothing happened so this is not what you expect from a five start hotel also breakfast was terrible compared to a year ago when i stayed around the time they first open so not sure if things are going down i invited people for breakfast and they were not happy so made me a bit uncomfortable to the credit of the front desk she took off one breakfast out of three i would have been happy to pay and get the breakfast i had one year ago at the hotelno positive room a bit small too dark at night in the room didn t like the scent in the lobby at first but then i got used to it xd beautiful decor everywhere big bathroom sweet receptionist girl fast wifi comfortable bed could be clearer this is a boutique bed and breakfast experience not a   start hotel the comfort room is so small it s unusable the rooms are dark and have no central lighting some rooms do not have a stand up shower concierge service is patchy and no on duty on the afternoon we needed help no evening turn down service the property is not marketed accurately the quiet room comfy bed relaxed atmosphere a lovely luxury b and b experience i would visit again now i know what the venue offers no negative the location was excellent our room was amazing really spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable we would definetly stay there again the staff were helpful booking us tours   the hotel doesn t have a very friendly welcome we expected them to serve us some drinks or snacks a gesture that a professional   stars hotel would normally have instead we had to do it by ourselves perhaps we re quite picky when it comes to hotel services   the housekeeping staff was very unprofessional she didn t know anything in the room e g when i asked the staff if i can change the sparkling water bottle to mineral water bottle she looked at me very confused and shaked her head and when she finally understood what i was talking about she was pretty annoyed that i requested a different type of water bottle   not enough of complimentary items there were no comb no rasor furthermore everytime we ran out of shampoo or basically anything in our room we had to ask for more no extra water bottle when we finished our water bottle in the room   the breakfast didn t impress us very little choice of food i really love my room very spacious beautifully decorated despite the hotel size the toilet is very clean highly functional the t v is very big the system is very sophisticated lots of movies available to watch the staff in the reception is very friendly and helpful and always in their post at anytime the hotel s location is very ideal situated in the  th arrondissement of paris very close to the metro and to the eiffel tower a receptionist called alena was unfriendly and has upset face all the time even not responding to a greeting location room design and good furniture classic room too small no place to put my bag breakfast very minimal and breakfast area very dark location is a little far from champs elysees very clean nice staff rooms ready on time our tv to watch movies was broken the entire trip that should never happen for any hotel let alone a   star all that was given was a half bottle of champagne service is good but the service and hotel itself isn t a   star hotel maybe     bed was super comfortable staff very take care from start but staaff on the night he not so nice with my asia lady excellent of breakfast and services wonderful of design and exclusive furniture bed very comfortable high technology of tv in room if we back to paris we will choose this hotel again good location and easy to go everywhere by bus and metro train price is very good for   stars hotel the hotel is not a   star property by any means breakfast is very poor and there are no facilities in the hotel the bathroom was very clean and nice the facilities were limited the hotel is super cute and artsy close to the eiffel tower and nearby shopping i booked for a club room but got upgraded to a junior suite so my room was spacious and the bathroom was very clean and tiles were so pretty the bed is by far one of the most comfy beds i have experienced in a hotel i ll definitely go back no complaints the hotel has a modern feel with large rooms and lovely bath rooms the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful breakfast was included with our room and a great value location was close to so many sites and in walking distance from everything i would ve liked to order just coffee for room service but was told that i had to order the full breakfast and that if i wanted coffee to go down to the breakfast area and ask nicely if i could get it to go or to drink the coffee from the machine in the room which was terrible the television s movie section was not working no one seemed able to fix it i was told that the engineer wasn t working it wasn t that big a deal but at the end of day it s sometimes nice to get into bed and just watch a movie or wake up in the morning to a nice cup of hot coffee while still in your pj s especially in a   star hotel the room was beautiful and very clean and the bed was an absolute dream the bathroom was spacious and really beautiful with great water pressure in the shower the location of the hotel couldn t be better would have enjoyed a continental breakfast and wasn t going to be pay   euros for it the most comfortable beds i have slept in perfect location of eiffel tower the staff was so friendly and accommodating felt really welcome beautiful hotel absolutely nothing a comfortable beautiful hotel in a great location stroll away from main attractions and main streets for shopping and lonely food the staff were incredibly helpful and so pleasant it felt like a home away from home housekeeping while always superb in keeping the room very clean was a bit inconsistent in refreshing toiletries not a big deal and quickly corrected upon request we just chalked it up to growing pains the room was exceedingly clean and comfortable bathroom was very spacious location superb quiet residential yet in the heart of the  th beautiful design terrific breakfast with very accommodating staff delightful experience the price is pretty high compared to the location thare are many places with high standard like this hotel but lower price and better location bed and all facilities are awesome nothing that we can think of all was perfect everything is super classy and well designed extremely high quality of furniture and fixtures and super service with a smile the only thing we might have wanted to change was the amount of light in the room when we were packing the indirect lighting in the rooms was not sufficient from the moment we arrived to the time we left the hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful providing us with directions and attending to our every need the rooms were spotlessly clean which is a very big deal to us the bed was big warm and comfortable thereby giving us   wonderful nights of restful sleep we will definitely be coming back to stay at hotel juliana again there was an odor in our room it was a bit overwhelming front desk offered to move us but didn t want to lose our view of the eiffel tower they even tried to give us something to use to help with smell consistency wasn t there when our room was cleaned daily the bathroom floor wasnt always clean didn t have right amount of towels some nights or missing face towels toilet paper was low and there wasn t an extra one in room assumed housekeepers would replenish but didn t our last night we got a small bottle water next to our bed candy and clean feet towel next to our bed this never happened any of the other nights one other thing to maybe help better overall stay was the temperature in sauna area it was too hot and no air coming in it s okay to be in actually steam room or dry sauna but the lounging area was uncomfortable to sit because of no air circulating front desk crew was superb always courteous and willing to help or answer questions breakfast was a ten star food was terrific and staff was also phenomenal location was awesome and quiet neighborhood no negative we stayed in a club room which was a good size for a paris hotel room the hotel was very quite clean and staff was very friendly hotel was decorated with a elegant taste and the items used were high quality and very well selected in addition location was very good a minute walk to seine certainly not   star in common sense of classification can rate it max   star compare to other experiences i stay in different hotels around he world minimum   days a year it is much overpriced location convenient but isn t great staff is very friendly and helpful but we had to remind about bottle of champagne that was included in the price three times and finally it was delivered to the room on a last day of stay so could not be used overall filling is ok no restaurant small rooms was advertised on your site as airport pickup however the price when we inquired was greater than the taxis fare location was good cleaning staff needs to be better trained several issues both days with parts of the room cleaning being incomplete floors not cleaned towels not replaced etc very friendly and helpful staff a very positive mood in the hotel lovely decor there was no fitting on the wall for the shower head so i had to hold it and it was a bit too short great location within walking distance from the eiffel tower and the champs eliseu room service breakfast was included in the room you can order whatever you like we had eggs salmon pain au chocolate toast coffee tea hot chocolate orange juice cranberry juice all brought to the room within   mins of ordering it was the first time i ve ever ordered room service so i was quite excited the bathroom was excellent too with quality shampoo and conditioner staff were really nice too really nothing i recommend to everyone everything perfect size room club very comfortable bed super bathroom sound proofed quite room so everything to have a flawless and relaxing holiday location is more than great staff is very friendly and helpfulno negative everything was perfect staffs were very helpful they gave a big room to us omelet with olive oil was very delicious location is very good already no restaurant only breakfast room room service  h but nobody answers the phone not enough staff no bellboy nobody helps you with the luggage only   person at the reception not a   service i ordered a taxi fot the next morning the taxi never came had to order another one after   min waiting check out took   min the computer at the reception stopped working and the receptionist had to restart it the restaurant charged me for breakfast which was included in the room rate they cancelled the charge when i told them its included i found a bottle of water half empty in the minibar the reception offered me another bottle of water free of charge good location kind receptionists large bathroom nice bathroom amenities for the high price and   stars i was surprised to be in a room when we booked a suite the tv didn t work properly for   days and details like mostly no water in the sauna and too hard to find any were a bit of a let down otherwise fine lovely comfortable bed very quiet room area good location for the river eiffel tower nice breakfast and quiet environment no negative the staff was very friendly and helpful the location of the hotel is excellent and is surrounded by many of the key attractions in paris the breakfast was really good and the rooms are comfortable the heater was broken they brought a noisy one as replacement the bathroom sink is not practical the interior design is over the location the shower the bed the fitness and hamam poor breakfast as we had a   starts hotel location we had   rooms but no one had a stunning view lighting not shining restaurant absence limited staff the same staff serving reception room service luggage servicesno negative everything was perfect the new interiors the service the super kind staff the bathroom is amazing the products bulgari amazing as well we will come back for sure it s a wonderful hotel very near to avenue montaigneno negative i travelled with my sister for a few days to paris the location of the hotel is excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful the room was very cosy clean and extremely comfortable we loved the movie channel breakfast was included and we loved it specially the coffee all and all we had an excellent stay at the juliana as most of the feedback i read about this hotel it is having bad smell coming from the toilet and hotel management can not solve it i need to keep the window open all the night even the weather freezing to get some ventilation breakfast is under the ground resturant if you take shower water will flood to the room carpet and where you wash hand you can t control the water and all time you will get massive splashing of water on you because the bad design of basin it is nice location and new facilitiesno negative the location is superb just a few steps away from the seine and very close to the eiffel tower we had the club room very large with a super comfortable bed we have received a very nice meal tray and the staff was polite and kind the sink in the bathroom have to be changed you always get wet every time you use the sink central location and yet residential area feeling at home the staff is very helpful they are really fantastic no negative we were treated like kings and queens our every wish was fulfilled and we had the best time the concierge knows everything about the city and is always helpful the hotel is situated exactly between the eiffel tower and the shopping street champs elys e and very close to the metro station i can truthfully recommend this hotel boutique bar on a cold evening the fireplace shedding a picture and no heat was a disappointment prices for room service and in the bar were a little cheeky bright clean and fresh bathroom jo malone toiletries is a first comfortable bed and pillows great sleep at check in on     i said them that i will pay my stay in cash anyway they blocked me   eur as deposit from my cc at check out i paid in cash but the amount of eur   till today       month later is still not release no positiveno negative beautifully decorated hotel with interesting features and displays of art we loved how small and cosy the hotel is adding a personal element to your stay the room was plenty big enough and the bath and shower was perfect loved the tv with the music and movies for free the staff were very pleasant and the hotel is situated in an ideal and perfect place couldn t believe how close to the eiffel tower we were we would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future only minor issue was that our safety deposit box didn t work but only a minor thing fantastic location great friendly staff great breakfast very clean everywhere the bathroom design was not good enough chase when you take shower the water will flood all the bathroom good location good service the most important is very comfortable bed small slightly larger than a cruise ship stateroom and poorly illuminated room bathroom features style over function as exemplified by the sink bowl which is oversized but sloping surfaces eliminates useful space for toiletries while using the sink faucet must be operated at extremely low volume lest the user gets soaked by over splash oversized tub fails to hold water due to poor drain seal overspray from shower results in a wet bathroom floor toilet positioned too close to sidewall for   pound man very helpful and attentive staff great location on quiet side street super comfy king size bed excellent and diverse breakfast offerings invigorating shower with multiple settings heavy drapery provides darkness during daylight none the staffs are service straight from the heart they are polite professional and patient they greet me with a friendly smiling and offer to show me around the hotel before i get in to my room they give me the very detail and helpful information about the sightseeing places restaurants and bars they care about my feeling and offer everything i need before i ask such as giving me the map taking care of my mails arranging the transportation for me to go to the airport from the hotel and so on they make you feel like you are home the location of the hotel is good it is all walking distance to the famous places shopping center the subways and the nice restaurants the room is very comfortable and fancy everything is perfect i have an amazing staying there excellent no negative staffs are very nice we have lost something in our room but they have been put into my luggage the bed is very comfortable a very satisfied experience moreover the breakfast is delicious and plentiful i was   hours late to check out and they charge me   an hour possibly not i checked in around   pm so they should have not charge beautiful hotel with great location it was value of money cleaning was not as good as other elements for example they had not cleaned the bathroom one day and another day they left the mopping cloth in a draw in the bathroom not very impressive staff were great would have been nice if the rooms had been cleaned from one day to next but no one had serviced the room even when i complained at  pm still came back at  pm and nothing had been done except the curtains drawn bathroom had not been touched   of our   rooms booked where the same central to where we wanted to be we had no view of the eiffel tower great location where we were able to access the left bank of paris extremely well would stay here again there was construction at the property and after   pm the only food available is   hamburger and club sandwich which is not of high qualityno positive the bedroom is a bit dark because of insufficient lights the comfort of the bedroom wonderful bed small but convenient gym nice bar the heating did not work even though i asked twice for it to be fixed breakfast quality is quite poor for a     star hotel the decoration they blocked   euro as insurance they told me we will give it to you in   days now   days gone nothing come back to meno positiveno negative check in only one person took a long long time we needed to leave for a meeting and wanted to drop off our luggage nothing it was all great very modern french great location very clean staff were great and always at your service with a smileno negative location is great close walking distance to eiffle tower and grand palais lovely staff we had fun with experimenting the pillow menu breakfast was extremly poor in a bad location rooms are very small staffs are really friendly and helpfull the location is also goodno negative the jo malone products in the bathroom the beds the room the staff and the location are all incredibly deserving of this   star rating unusual not to have restaurant except for breakfast not a problem really as they do provide free coffee treats in foyer area     pm also will order in for you if you want but seriously no need as the minute you step outside there are lots and lots of eateries location was excellent as were decor staff and atmosphere lots of shops and restaurants nearby robes and slippers a lovely extra luxury everything was wonderful the hotel was excellent it was close to the metro the staff was very friendly we couldn t have asked for anything more they did not have washcloths hotel l antoine was wonderful staff without exception was excellent they went out of their way to make your stay comfortable and help you navigate the city lots of restaurants in the neighborhood and a nice grocery store around the corner everything great but room was quite small it was good we only had   small cases very friendly and helpful staff close by two metro stations and loads of restaurants and bars nearby also good shops no negative the room was very spacious considering it was a small boutique hotel in the city it was very clean and we even had our own nespresso machine nice touch slip mat in bathroom plus handrail room fridge check not adequate so missing items small space well organised front desk staff very helpful tiny room for   eur per night very friendly and helpful staff very good wifi good location   minutes away from bastille by walking distance clean breakfast is priced at   euros so we declined this found a bar within   yds with formule at   euros all details carefully thought through super quiet rooms on request they volunteered the preferred language for communication tea tray in room and free tea coffee in breakfast room throughout loads of eateries nearby all with great atmosphere room very small but the space is planned well which makes it annoying that there is no hook for coats desk really too small to work at so i had to work in the lobby a fair amount very clean great staff access to metro the minibar in our room was a tad noisy but after a full day in paris even the lightest sleepers will drift off into the dreamland and not notice the minibar noise staff is definitely the gold of this wonderfully and beautifully decorated hotel everyone we encountered was super nice helpful and knowledgeable and could put a smile on your face also the location is very convenient close to several metro stations and excellent boulangeries and eateries and we were happy to notice the windows of our street facing room provide good soundproofing from the lively french nightlife so you can have a good night s sleep i wasn t happy with the reception area it is way too small there was a family wedding in paris and   of us were staying at the hotel but we couldn t hang out together at all no room they have a two seater couch and two wing back chairs i liked the bed and shower the location was good toono negative we liked everything decor amazing staff could not have been more helpful location superb spotless price excellent value travelled with family and had nine rooms and not one problem the wifi this stay in room   wasn t working that strong stayed at l antoine lots of times and it was never an issue so could be an isolated thing or just location of the room it s a boutique type paris hotel that quirky but delivers a great stay in true parisian hotel style the room was on the tiny side for us this was really no problem the hotel is located on a quiet street but conveniently near a bustling commercial street our room faced a well lit interior courtyard the staff at the l antoine was exceptionally friendly and professional helping us with tickets and logistics the design of the hotel appeals to a trendy younger crowd as funny as it sounds the bathroom was great very reliable free wifi sink was a bit small shower tricky to get into loved the free snax and water in the break room also the awesome hot breakfast great atmosphere and staff was superb don t buy the overpriced breakfast book direct to have it included in your room rate it go out to one of the many cafes oh the other thing i didn t like was having to leave a wonderful boutique hotel excellent styling and bursting with personality what the rooms lack in size is certainly balance by artistry and amazing design no negative the location is in a great neighborhood with many restaurants shops and bars the closeness to the gare the lyon is another plus our room to the court was very quiet and we shared a junior suite among   friends the bathroom was super spacious and the hot shower and big bathtub were a blessing after a day out in january cold paris we ll come back no negative the personnel was very friendly and helpful always greeting and ready to answer any questions functional but very small room nice walk in shower amazing deco i loved these tiles location close to the subway the room was a bit small but to be honest i didn t expect to stay at a bigger room in paris the room was very clean and well equipped and the personnel was very helpful also it was very quiet overall and at a good area i would definitely recommend it nothing we didn t like we loved staying here the rooms and bathrooms are large and clean the beds are very comfortable even the sofa bed if you need an extra one the staff are excellent and very helpful the area is fabulous with lots of places to eat and the hotel is very close to the metro and it s an easy walk to gare de lion tgv station no negative excellent staff multi lingual very friendly and extremely helpful the room was well equipped nicely decorated but very small i will definitely size up on our next visit excellent breakfast good location   minutes walk from bastille metro entrance almost on doorstep hotel location is on a quiet side street with nice boutique shops cafes and restaurants the room was very small which we knew it would be but the position of the large cupboard made it appear even smaller everything you could wish for in the room writing desk tea coffee making facilities fridge etc i know paris hotel rooms are small but my wife slept in the bed i slept on the floor suitcase had to go in the bathroom and bathroom was thus not accessible c est tr s petite but we still loved it beatiful style nice coffee and cake and cafe facility location perfectno negative the receptionist was very nice and upgrade us to a higher room when we mistake only thought that the water doesn t work the hotel was nicely renovated and close to bastille nothing it s a great little hotel in a cool part of paris and great value for money spotlessly clean comfortable room big by paris standards cool design we didn t have breakfast we were too busy enjoying the room no negative always smiling and present stuff ready to solve all problems fluent in multi languages doing their best to supply the best service i have stayed here several times and i can confirm that all these qualities are consistent looking forward to my next time air con didn t work pretty small rooms but would definitely stay there again beautiful refurbished bathrooms great water pressure   mins to the train in the heart of shops and cafes very quiet rooms couldn t hear the next room or the road very clean the small size of single rooms n poor ergonomics viz no bedside tables n insufficient space to move even a tiny bit the luggage rack when properly set up stops one accessing the wardrobe the only table in the room is unusually small with tv remote telephone competing for space with the tea n coffee rack i ended up crowding the table further with medicine n other personal trinkets the friendly n helpful stats especially juan so cheerful n forthcoming in providing info on dining sightseeing n transport i also like the unique interior decor based on christian lacroix design concepts nothing the staff were nothing short of amazing nothing was too much trouble and they were extremely knowledgeable about the area booked a fantastic restaurant for  pm with less than an hours notice would highly recommend the next time we visit paris we all be staying here the room was a little tight with two of us having large suitcases the hotel is spotless and the staff were very welcoming enjoyed the design and details and the honesty bar was appreciated nice quiet hotel with great security liked the idea of turning in the key to the front office the location has lots of restaurants in the area appreciated that the staff were willing to help us with arranging a ride to the airport nothing to report location lively street with bars restaurants and shops near public transport and a velolib station staff extremely friendly and helpful room we booked the junior suite and it was the best hotel experience i ve ever had in paris and beyond spacious nicely decorated excellent a c system which was appreciated during heatwave conditions  c the bathroom one of the best hotel bathrooms i ve ever come across spacious powerful shower and bath all in all a gem of a hotel my husband found the bed comfortable but my side was a bit soggy great position in interesting area close to bastille and gare de lyon staff very friendly and helpful bedroom small but very stylish the size of the standard rooms is rather small which makes the hotel less appropriate for a longer stay we had some difficulties to stow our suitcase away in the room without stumbling over it recently renovated hotel very modern up to date equipment very friendly and helpful staff both at front desk as well as during breakfast quiet rooms with good silently working airco we had a modern bathroom with good rainshower good choice of breakfast value for money only   meters away from subway entrance no negative the staff at the hotel was extremely helpful and polite they helped us with all the possible questions we had the location is nice there are lots of restaurants and bars close to the hotel and the area is lively two metro stations are also close by so it doesn t take too long to get to all the major sights i have no complaints room was very small although that s not unusual for paris fantastically helpful and friendly staff very comfortable room with excellent shower and quiet despite very central location i had to leave too early for breakfast unfortunately rooms were clean but smelled of smoke rooms were modern and great location would stay again when we complained about smoke they didn t really do anything but when we followed up they gave us free breakfast no negative well placed very close to the place de la bastille friendly staff and quirky decor clean comfortable and well equipped i will definitely be going back none very stylish room and quite spacious good location with a lot of restaurants around and easy reach to a lot of the attractions only   mins walk to metro station cannot think of anything great vibrant location great staff melanie juan thierry they were there for anything we needed the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful great bars and restaurants everywhere great shopping too nothing could not fault the hotel or the staff and loved the complimentary expresso water bottles and pastries staff were great they helped me book a taxi and dinner for a large group and were always very friendly location was perfect and so easy to get everywhere especially from gare du nord station reserved double room and they forced an upgrade in order to have two people in it room was very small even for paris i mean it was a maneuver everytime we did anything in the room tiny excellent pizza and parisian restaurants across the street most of the staff was friendly and accommodating enjoyed the coffee and tea being available in the lobby they were happy to help store luggage until check in time while we went and explored metro is just down the block very important the standard room we booked was too small for a couple with luggage we should have take the superior room for extra space the service by front counter staff was exceptional always smiling with a good command of english they supplied us with an extra umbrella on a rainy day plus arranged transport to paris orly airport on our departure nothing good location staff were helpful and friendly room was small but had everything i required i had room facing inner courtyard which was nice and quite bathroom facilities were modern clean and nicely finished on my floor the doors closed extremely loudly not really much of a complaint though the rooms are small but at  m  as advertised i wasnt expecting larger the hotel is in an excellent location in bastille close to several metro stations and a   minute walk from notre dame the staff are very friendly and helpful no negative location was great near bastille room was a little small but stunning design loved the bathroom and the shower was great loved it and would stay again as is usual in paris rooms are pretty small so if you are in need of some space go for the bigger rooms great location and nicely decorated excellent staff the room was very warm at night i was told the air conditioning units were not turned on yet because it was out of summer april at night we could not open the window because of the noise outside we did get a fan the next day from reception also no cold beers in the fridge at the honesty bar loved the room and the staff great central location good value for money the room was clean comfortable and spacious wifi was not working that night room quite small but functional friendly and professional staff location just next to clubs and restaurants room was quiet nothing a terrific hotel in a great location the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they would take the time to have a chat as you passed recption the room was extremely well appointed and care had been taken to get the design spot on i was particularly impressed by the generous provision of power points the powerful shower and the comfortable bed the purpose of my visit was to catch up with a friend who was playing a gig in the area easy access to the metro meant that the whole of the city felt close at hand the room was miniscule total style over substance no storage space no room for even one bedside table likewise the bathroom not a single towel rail it s probably the smallest so called double room i ve ever encountered the location is great with a good restaurant chez paul within staggering distance the hotel is stylish and immaculate not particular to this hotel hotels in paris are expensive for a   star breakfast was delicious but  euros pp is steep rooms are micro bathroom comfortable size but prefer toilet not so close to bed make sure you get the best price as we did on booking com rack rates price this hotel above its value great little hotel little is a true description friendly staff close to some of our favourite restaurants metro and bastille steps away the breakfast spread could have been better the staff was very friendly and the room was extremely clean and tidy given that it is paris understandably it was a little small but everything was neatly arranged would definitely recommend the place for short stays the shower screen in my room didn t shut completely so water was leaking onto the floor everytime i took a shower great location about   mins walk from the marais and pompidou two metro lines within a couple of mins walk away plenty of local cafes and bars in the vicinity they gave one of us who had booked into a more basic room a free upgrade so everyone was happy minuses some guys were quarreling on street at night which was well heard to the room and the room was a little hot friendly staff and comfortable  bedroom room originally booked twin room but was upgraded by the nice receptionist as it was actually not available hotel is  min from bastille metro station many cafes nearby definitely looking to book againno negative rooms were very well presented and equipped great location and juan on reception was incredibly helpful and friendly overall all staff were great would definitely stay again this was not a con per se in my book but you should be aware that the small rooms are a bit tight i found them comfortable and adorable but don t expect something gigantic the hotel itself is beautifully maintained and in a wonderful location combined with the price however this hotel was exceptional the only complain was odour of the bed sheets and smell in the room in general it speaks a lot about the maintainance procedures in the hotel location is excellent hotel is design conscious with new facilities and excellent taste rooms are rather small but perfectly ok for single use double room breakfast is great various choices nice area and quickly replenished no negative the hotel is very small but room are nice and comfortable the hotel is located in a nice area very close to the subway and allows for quick moving around breakfast is good so if possible choose it there is literally nothing to dislike we loved everything about the hotel we were able to check in six hours early and enjoy a cup of coffee in the dining room the staff especially juan went out of their way to be informative kind and professional our room was adorable small but immaculate we are extremely tall people but there was enough room for us to be comfortable the decor was such fun with many contrasting yet coordinating patterns of tile and wallpaper the towels were plush the bedding crisp and there were many outlets for charging our devices the bathroom looked like an advertisement for porcelain products we overlooked a quaint courtyard and kept our window open all night our street had superb restaurants outstanding and reasonable with zero tourism we never heard an accent other than french being spoken la fontaine for croissants and live music chez paul for elegant french cuisine foie gras cafe de la peintures perhaps the most beautiful restaurant i ve ever set foot in with its art nouveau designs all were on our street bookstores lovely shops and cafes were everywhere i will stay at hotel l antoine next time it s less than five minutes walk to two metro stations in the bastille area no negative this is the second time i stay at this hotel this year and we decided to take the breakfast this time a choice that didn t disappoint the breakfast was very diverse the foods were fresh from small producers and often replenished there were options for the gluten intolerant people as well this was a real treat road front room extremely noisy on friday and saturday leaking shower a bit of an issue charges for breakfasts we did not eat and minibar item we did not use appeared on the bill ready access to good restaurants and shops as well as the marais area very pleasant and helpful front desk staff who really went out of their way to assist us not too close to major attractions such as eiffel tower or notre dame although very accessible to metro staff were great and very comfortable in english close to some good shopping and restaurants the standard room is  m  but it felt smaller the location is good just   min away from metro the staff members were all friendly and helpful with a good sense of humour no negative greeted by a warm staff that made us feel like home we were told we had the best floor each floor has different themed decorations the mood of the floors was quite nice the shower was perfect no parking on site but parking was close to the location great little gem close to bastille juan at the reception was very helpful and nice and the overall concept of the hotel is great rooms are clean modern and super well equipped no negative the room was nicely decorated with enough room for what we wanted heating was great breakfast was great too the hotel was right next to one of the ledru rollin metro entrances and a short walk away from the bastille station which made it very easy to travel within the city or get to the train station to go to disney there is also a bike rental rack right in front of the hotel if you want to use that the navigo pass makes it cheap to use everything if when we go back we will most likely stay at this hotel again if you re on a budget there s a mac and subway and a monoprix and dia supermarket right around the corner you can easily pic stuff up for a picnic along the sienne just a small note very very small so sometime a little uncomfortable to move in the room and find place for the luggage nice beautiful decoration clean very good breakfast everything is perfect this is the best hotel ever in this trip we got upgraded for our honey moon the room is very big and clean and comfortable a bottle of wine was prepare for us also i love this place and it would be our first choice next time to paris no negative the hotel is situated close to the ledru rollin metro station and not too far away from bastille metro station it is very easy to be reached the staff offered us the best service we received during our trip in paris they are kind friendly courteous and ready to help with a warm smile we were offered an early check in to our surprise we went to the hotel just to leave our luggage until the official check in time but the room had been just released and coffee while we waited the room to get ready for us it was a wonderful surprise for two really tired travellers the room was large enough larger than we expected based on what we read when we made the booking and impeccable the room was also quiet despite a noisy gathering of sports watchers nearby we passed by them on our way back to the hotel the bed was large and comfortable we had a restful sleep the wifi worked very well and it was fast i would definitely recommend this hotel a big thank you for everyone at the hotel who made our staying really pleasant and comfortable everything we didn t like was bathroom related i was surprised the bathroom toiletries had a combined shampoo body wash and no conditioner for this level of hotel our suite didn t come with a hairdryer and it took three separate requests to get one the rainfall shower showed signs of calcification from the hard parisien water it could use a regular swipe with some vinegar we landed a suite at the hotel which was huge anywhere massive for paris because we booked last minute we had a very good deal like   off everything was spotless we really appreciated the outlets on both sides of the bed and the double door entry for extra quiet from the hallway we slept comfortably and could have stayed there for two weeks the neighborhood seems to be the paris equivalent of williamsburg with very stylish shopping and hipster bars breakfast was generous and it s a nice option to take the lighter menu directly in the room no problem connecting to wifi small thing shower wasn t great if you re fussy about that the location the staff the uniqueness of the decor made me feel like i was in the city of cool design the only thing i would mention is that our bed was actually two twin beds pushed together and dressed as if it was a full queen not sure which size large enough for both of us however i really like to cuddle with my partner in bed and the line down the middle made that somewhat uncomfortable however the mattresses were both very comfortable on their own this hotel was absolutely gorgeous i loved the bathroom and room design beautiful taste in furniture and the tiling wall paper plush carpeting very clean just amazing classic rooms are v small small amount of water under floorboards in bathroom rectified by covering with bath mat some noise from the fridge in the room could wake a light sleeper location style of hotel breakfast food choice great double glazed windows stopped any noise from outside wifi good no negative the hotel is quirky and very french in its bold colour choices which worked beautifully the staff made me very welcome and as a mature solo traveller i felt very safe in their care the room was quite small but the decor was very nice which made up for it the customer service was the best part of the hotel all the staff were really friendly and helpful and went out of their way to deal with any questions we had for example recommending and booking a restaurant for us telling us the best ways to get to certain places etc very small accommodations tried to make the most of the space but smallee rooms than even the typical paris hotel great location new hotel with modern touches bathroom is one of the best i have seen in paris no negative in the centre of bastille but in a quite street the fantastic decoration done from christian lacroix the choise of tapestry the bathroom tiles amazing nice boutique hotel which smells brand new all personnel in the reception were genuinely kind nothing everything was great the staff is really great melanie and erik were super welcoming always hepful and smiling the others too excellent tea an cake in the lobby for free we felt like home proximity to   metro lines and   buses taking you right to the opera tour eiffel louvre etc everything was great staff was extremely helpful room was clean but rather small we had superior room with a bit of more space compared to standard room bed was super comfortable saw comments that bathroom is extremely small it was small but i didn t feel lack of space everything was neat and clean location of the hotel is great lots of eating places and bars you could do some shopping as well there are a lot of clothes stores in the area hotel is close to bastille station and   mins drive from gare du nord the airconditioning did not work very well and with the windows closed it was pretty hot in our room nice decoration and good furniture wifi signal in the room was very weak very pleasant room everything one might need for one night enjoyed exploring a new area of paris bed made my back ache lost its bounce due to being over slept wifi not strong enough to do a skype call nice staff no negative staff at desk really friendly and approachable liked how you could help yourself to hot drinks at any time of the day well locatedno negative great location   hr reception and staffing incredibly comfy bed and fab waterfall rain head shower everything was clean and well designedno negative loved the decor beds very comfy staff lovely free coffee and cakes during the day quiet even though on a main road would definitely return nothing the room is spacious but cosy bathroom is impressive central location that very close to public transports perfect for short time stay rooms are small  m  for a medium sized priced room excellent location great bed quiet room arty trendy hotel suburb and awesome serviceno negative everything it s wonderful firt the employee s is the best then the hotel is ok and the breakfast is tasty no negative very accessible location hotel staff were courteous especially juan who gave extra effort to help me find my way to my meeting venue no negative the staff was great and very helpful the hotel is located very close to a metro station and in a great area for restaurants and pubs no negative warm friendly staff especially on the front desk all shifts convenient to metro and bus queit but plenty of places to eat and drink nearby no negative renovated clean room and bathroom wifi worked great hotel staff were very friendly and helpful chez paul room service for dinner was delicious no negative we really like the warmth and friendliness of the staff the location the design of the room and the hotel basically everything no negative everything at this hotel is very good metro is near a halal restaurant is opposite to the hotel but more quality at rooms is needed the big cabinets could be removed as they take a good place at the room and we didn t use them at all toilet paper towels location very close to arc de triump perfect for shopping gallure close to everything shop restaurant arc de triump eiffel tower champ elysees lovre museum location perfect room is okey and the hotel ok the staff very friendly accomodating the breakfast is too simple for me so i eat outside location of the hotel perfect internet speed was very poor breakfast was very so so and no one at the breakfast place speaks or understands english amazing location easy to reach single rooms quite comfortable knowing that the hotel is inside an old building the price of the room is quite high the rooms have a splendid but somewhat weary louis  th style bathrooms are updated and the location is superb one of the best regions to stay in paris the cleaning does not include filling up the mini bar or taking away used glasses towels and sheets are always changed clean and nice but sometimes lacking both soap and toilet paper at one occasion they seem to be in some kind of a rush kindness of staff in the reception area is super though the staff was excellent very nice and helpful   hours service at the reception area helped to arrange drycleaning or reserve a taxi answer questions and so forth because we were getting married i asked for a room with a view so they upgraded us to a very nice room   of the days the weekend we where getting married with no extra charge   the hotel is worn out and facilities are not up to date for instance bronze keys are required to open the door and security locks from the inside are not available which makes me feel unsafe i simply failed to open the door and the hotel staff helped me to do so who is a friendly guy location is excellentno negative i requested a high floor room with a balcony and i received it with a spectacular view to eiffel tower and arc du triumph bed was comfy bathroom is newly renovated everything was clean breakfast was moderate included fresh croissant cafe du lait and yogurt also cornflakes cheese eggs milk juice and jam wifi speed was good staff were very nice felt like home location is perfect   mins walk to champs elysees street metro easily accessible restaurants nearby couldn t ask for more wifi was not the secured type i couldn t use it for some sensitive inputs because the building is old footstep noise from upper floor may bother some travelers location very close to the bus stop though it is an old building i liked the atmosphere of the room and the bathroom was renovated i booked via booking com and it was fully paid through my debit card but seems like they dont have any coordination in between i had to pay again to the hotel and then request for refund from booking com the room was very small location is the best the elevator is a bit dubious but otherwise it s a quaint quirky and typically french fantastic location and super friendly staff on the front desk my room was only small but perfectly comfortable breakfast was simple but perfect local restaurants a great particularly the caesar next door great pizza and pasta and l arc down the hill try the home made rum the room was too small but i guess that is in most of paris hotels   minutes walking distance to arc de triumph charles de gaulle m tro station just downstairs the airport bus service   meters away the hotel stuff were very welcoming security after midnight a very good place to stay in heart of paris there was tea and coffee in the room but not enough to last two people a day and there was no milk but the reception were more than happy to provide a small pot of fresh milk this hotel is perfectly situated near a metro station and also the air france bus stop is only   metres away the hotel rooms are small but it s paris so i wasn t expecting a large room the bathrooms were spacious and shower etc worked great check in was easy no negative we paid a little extra for a room with a view and it was worth it we could even see part of the eiffel tower room was very comfortable and clean great location with the metro close by staff were also very helpful no negative the staff were so lovely and welcoming the hotel was in the bestest possible location will be returning everytime i m in paris as the hotel was beautiful and the staff were wonderful thank you all so much our room was very small the fridge didn t work so we were unable to keep milk cold to make a cup of tea reported it to reception but still hot had lots of trouble with getting enough hot water reported it also   staff tried to help but language barriers make dealing with staff difficult all in all we had a fridge that was hot and hot water that was cold the location is very good only short walk to restaurants and attractions breakfast was good and staff in breakfast room very pleasant small rooms excellent location staff was very sweet and helpful rooms are clean but small although typically for paris for the price you can t ask for much more the room was kind ve small european style but i guess i shared it with   other girls be prepared to be intimate with your friends in the small space the hotel is in a great location pretty central in paris its right out of a metro line   a b   there are not amendities like gym or spa but it did the job daily cleaning was good and helped make the room feel new and clean everyday nothing to be changed excelent location direct bus from to airports   meter   meter to letoile metro in the heart of paris walking distance to convention center extra cordial friendly staff clean rooms corridors ambiant atmosphere rich tasty fresh fine breakfast in a roccoco dining room the croissones were finest stuff and also fresh whole fruits need to add sound proof because of you can hear your neigbor from the room next to you the staff very friendly and helpful we arrived early at the hotel after such a ling flight and they allowed us for early checked in since the room was ready too easy access for everything restaurant and cafe plenty at this area metro and rer access just about   meters from the hotel arc de triomphe just in front of you when you turn left after exiting the hotel door really fantastic when we arrived there were building materials on the floor in the lobby it was a bit dusty and had to manoeuvre around to get to the lift the bedroom wallpaper was interesting the terrace was excellent offering a view of the arc de triomph and eiffel tower fantastically located for us the bathroom was excellent and the staff were very helpfulno negative location of hotel is ideal for sightseeing and seeing the city we stayed in a room with a balcony and view and had full view of the arc de triomphe and the eiffel tower at a distance beautiful sights when lit up at night from the comfort of our room room was warm and comfortable and there was nothing i could complain about there is a main metro station practically right outside the door which allowed us to travel the whole city staff were very friendly at the front desk and helped us alot with showing us on maps how to get places on the metro staff at front desk also went out of their way to help me when i had trouble with tickets to disneyland they were very patient and did all they could to assist in the situation which worked out in the end overall a very pleasant experience in the belfast and would go back again to stay there room size too small the furniture a very old the elevator very small and you can hear the others from your room specially in the aisle the location is very close to a main metro station and the main street in the city the stuff very nice a couple of the rooms had very dim lights which made it hard to see the flood lights on the balconies distract from the amazing cries the location of this hotel is perfect for seeing paris there are also some great restaurants nearby which make things easy too the staff were very accommodating staff not well cooperate especially at check in cleaning is not good rooms are small you can hear your neighbor room when he standing speaking go to toilet and what he do old hotel need renewed location is good the hotel room itself was terrible nothing like the picture the bed was as tiny as the room not comfortable at all it felt more like a suffocating box with a view on other boxes rather than a comfortable hotel with a view on the arch of triumph the staff was pleasant enough rooms were small the staff was very polite and very helpful close to metro and arc de triumph very neat and clean rooms hotel was in right location and easy access one night receptionist was very rude to us when we asked him few questions about airport transfer the rest of the staff were very helpful and nice location is great right by the act de triomphe convenient access to the metro and direct airport shuttle stop is right behind the corner lots of restaurants all around and in a walking distance from everything rooms are clean and nice and we had a view to act de triomphe which was fantastic there where no aircondition and we had to sleep with open windows which was quite noisy nice view from the french balcony and plenty of food for breakfast plesent personell leaving the key to the room at the front desk just not use to that the electricity went out once and there was a humming noise all night the air conditioner worked well pleasant staff location was fantastic no negative beautiful atmosphere excellent location quiet but close to attractions and transportation friendly staff we would stay there again if we ever return to paris the elevator is small but you are able to get your luggage up to various floor the belfast hotel is nice and comfortable with a    th century feel beautfully decorated room and lobby this hotel is on carrot street with a   min or so walk to the arch of thriomph and a view of the iffle tower if you have a room overlooking the street in front of the hotel breakfast is available for a extra charge there s little problem with the bathroom design floor and other stuff get wet using the shower lovely room and helpful staff great location near metro and airport bus nothing we loved every detail of the hotel love the old charm of the hotel a nostalgic beauty of true parisienne super friendly and helpful staff esp gabriel he was kind enough to help us book our airport transfer with delight and help us whats the best paris can offer we truly enjoyed our stay bountiful breakfast in a salon we felt we were bought back to the golden age of glamour and sophistication location is a plus   min away from metro and  mins walk to champs lys es the shopping meca of paris the bedroom space corridors and elevators are cramped so if you are accustomed to a spacious living area you might want to reconsider booking the hotel staff was responsive no negative i was welcomed superbly by reception the hotel bought the flowers i requested it s the best place to stay in paris the room was not well illuminated and small i got the room with the view of arc de triumph and it was nice i could also see the eiffel from my room the hotel is very old and looks old and worn down it feels as thought the hotel isn t clean the bathroom was renovated and was clean old furniture very tiny balcony great location very well connected to most important things ro visit direct metro line nice staff clean rooms no negative really quirky hotel excellent location we stayed in a room overlooking the arc de triomphe and had a view of the eiffel tower incredible view very dim lights in the room a charming hotel with historical character nice interior cute details friendly staff i would stay there again no negative very nice restaurant all rooms are different even in the same category i did not like the room that was offered and staff proposed me to change for another one free of charge no negative this was a truly spectacular trip to remember the decor and the rooms scream opulence the staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful the view was absolutely breath taking the facilities were magnificent in short absolutely amazing stay arrived at    am hotel knows my arrival time as they have been informed earlier but room not provided until     pm clean excellent concierge serviceno negative we live in japan where service quality is always very high so honestly we were a bit nervous of possibly feeling disappointed by an hotel in paris regardless of its   stars turns out we weren t at all and the staff couldn t have been nicer and more helpful location is great and needless to say the room are impeccable and look gorgeous no negative the staff were very friendly and professional although they have a lot of customers and residents they give you the feeling and the attention as if you are the only one staying in the hotel they are never late your requests are immediately taken care of and if what you need is not available they exert all efforts to give you alternatives that suit your taste and demands the room had a very nice view on eiffel tower and the temperature was set to what really i wanted inside the room the view from the room was giving on the metallic structure of the restaurant roof bringing very little of natural light one night there was a wedding in the ball room and it was pretty noisy during the night but yh it is paris so it can happen we found   euro for breakfast really over exaggerated even for palace the palace is absolutely astonishing architecture and history makes this place very special service of palace speaks for itself you have the best for you nothing to add our room was comfortable and cosy very spacious bathroom and great bed of course very good swimming pool and spa area but the most i appreciated the quality of the massages the price was very high fitness could have been a little better but decent for paris there are better locations in paris to be based i believe but a nice hotel grand hotel near arc and trocadero rooms were reasonable size and nicely decorated usual high shangri la standard and style bed was amazing nothing everything about this hotel is perfect from the enormous bed with feather pillows to the stunning eiffel tower view from the bathtub it is just a perfect parisian stay have some misunderstanding about dry cleaning express the room is fantastic for eiffel view the food are excellent the stuff are great i love breakfast there the bed is very comfortable and large space i love shangri la paris this is the first time that i write a review they charged me twice the first time they charge me     the second time they charge me     on  th august which is the date i already left paris for  days i didn t understand how this happened i write email to the staff they said that they did a investigation it was pre authorization the bank will release the money i waited for few day i write another email to them with my bank statement they admitted that it was a mistake i mean you did a investigation before how come you didn t find out it was a mistake why can you still charge me on the day that i already left i need a explanation for this no positive my room wasn t ready on time and i had to go out around town before getting settled in when i returned my room was still not ready also the price is super expensive the view from my terrace was like something out of a fairytale not much shopping around the hotel but fine with the hubby who enjoyed the museum next door very attentive service from reception to departure food was delicious i didn t want to leave the hotel too much to do no negative we stayed there to celebrate my eldest daughter s  th birthday when we got in the room a bottle of champagne a cake and a handwritten note from the manager greeted my daughter we got the room with a balcony and a good the view of the eiffel and the garden below us we had food delivered to the room and everything was just perfect the tower s sparkle the delicious food good music in the wonderful company of my family made our stay there magical the only drawback would be the price point if you stay more than a couple i imagine the bill might come as a bit of a shock but as they say you get what you pay for the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our every wish the cocktails were unique and delicious the russian personnel on a reception is insufficiently courteous and delicate instead of putting possibility of earlier entry to us suggested to expect hour per a lobby and arrival in number is carried out at     no positive n a location eiffel tower view room pool staff food everything perfect attentive and extremely helpful consierge made our four day trip perfection the picture advertising the hotel shows a bar overlooking the eiffel tower there is no public space to overlook the tower and i was disappointed having such a short time in paris not to enjoy this view the staff and concierge service were very helpful and politeno negative i took my daughter for a special last night in paris and what a stay it was we were upgraded on arrival to a beautiful suite it was amazing and so were the staff didn t have a bad experience at all but just to note that the main image on the website left me thinking there was a beautiful rooftop bar terrace for guests but in fact is the penthouse suite so if you want a view like that you have to book a room with a view of the eiffel tower and you will not be disappointed one of my most enjoyable holiday experiences staying in this hotel the staff couldn t be more helpful i had a fabulous room with the most gorgeous view and i couldn t have asked for more we didn t get the complimentary tea on arrival that we were told about i loved the variety of places to eat and drink my wife and i would have liked to have a steam room together and a sauna but there isn t a sauna no positiveno negative they have one of the best concierge services that i have ever seen in my life many thanks to mr bastien lalanne and his team the breakfast area was too small with not enough seats and tables to accommodate guests on sunday breakfast was absolute chaos there were no coffee cups the kuerig machines weren t working there were no eggs or sausage or seats or milk or silverware and one poor staff person trying to do it all we wouldn t come back to this hotel because they are not prepared to serve breakfast to their guests no positive bathroom is a nightmare for privilege room their most expensive type of room no door for bathroom bad shower toilet is in a separate room a very very tiny room  sq feet    sqm with no sink a very unfortunate way to design a hotel room staff is helpful and nice location is very very good close to rer c subway and buses very poorly staffed for breakfast in tiny cramped restaurant   person trying to serve   guests   min waiting time to get clean spoons no warm milk for coffee no one to clear dirty tables hotel should not be offering breakfast if it cannot provide a proper service convenient location   min walk from eiffel tower next to bus metro and rer stations it is even not   stars and breakfast provided bad and staff are rude and the services are horrible the rooms are dirty there is no wifi coverage in rooms the bathroom is not ideal and the fridge is always hot inside they didn t give the wifi password no wifi in the rooms or restaurant no parking space the staff working in kitchen was friendly and helpfull but receptions staff was over over over i would re think the breakfast buffet it was ok but i am sure they can do much better helpful staff and quite tolerant had a very crappy problem with the near by car parking they simply had broken payment machines and no one to help out and the hotel staff helped with it location is very good if you want a point close to most of the famous monuments in paris no english television channels the phone in the room did not work room service menu was poor staff were friendly and helpful small room but comfortable nothing to compain did not have breakfast at the hotel though as plenty of choices in the area around located   meters away from metro javel easy access to paris center restaurants shops and coffee houses are very nearby on av grenelle river siene embankment is   meters away for good walks and runs embankment is excellent jogging route to the louvre area and further to notre damme area and back the rooms were too small and congested our room was not cleared of the glasses bottles etc even till the next night the staff who arranged the airport drop was not honest gave us a small vehicle after promising and charging for a larger vehicle the location was good the toilet was separate from a sink the receptioninst staff were very helpful and the hotel was located near a metro station which was good for getting around i stayed in this hotel          nights i asked the front desk to add my points to loyality account since  st night and i gave them my loyalty card no and i didn t see that they added it very poor breakfastno positive too expensive for what it is this is not a   star hotel they have empty minibar only free tv channel with not a single english language channel and no music channels location staff is good and friendly loud air conditioner attentive and very friendly staff very clean and the look of the room was pleasant i love the open windows good food and drink near by no negative the bed was comfortable staff were very friendly and so helpful we came as a group on a bike ride from london and they were all set up to store our bikes we asked for a disabled access room the step into the shower is very high there are no grab rails anywhere including in the seperate w c and no slip proof flooring in the shower room the noise of the metro rumbles through the building until late night a little noise from people above and below the front of house staff are amazing very friendly helpful and happy nothing is too much room cleaned daily and replenished free safe for valuables good location i was very disappointed with their flexibility to change a reservation date in which i made an error by one day i booked for day of my flight forgetting i would arrive a day later the total number of days would have been the same they would only change if i paid an additional   unbelievable and the day manager seemed to think it was funny not at all sorry i would not stay at a mercure hotel again no positive i can t think of a thing really we were very happy with the mercure eiffle tower it s excellent location is a very short walk to the juval station which easily takes you to versailles or the sites along the seine the closest bridge has the statue of liberty the next one is the eiffle tower we took the batobus a hop on hop off boat along the seine it took us to most of the major sites there are several nearby affordable good restaurants and the breakfast they offer in the hotel is excellent our room was spacious with big windows which keep the noise out the bathroom was exceptional in addition their staff was very accommodating and friendly yes we will stay there again local restaurants a bit limited but many more only a couple of metro stops away excellent access to the metro and rer a few meters walk velib bike rack across the street marvellous breakfast with lots of options the staff were superb easy transfer via rer from cdg airport and a short walk to our seine river cruise ship no negative the staff were more than accommodating they simply could not do enough for us the room was so spacious and even though we had no view of the eiffel tower we were looking over the seine river the room was fabulous and the complimentary drinks in the fridge and the nespresso machine were such nice touches to make our stay even more luxurious we turned air con down because the room was too hot otherwise cleaning staff turned it back up each day no need to do that although we hung the towels for re use cleaning staff changed them each day no need to do that either otherwise nothing to dislike room was large much larger than usual for a paris hotel at this grade nicely furnished and quiet good view over the river good bathroom did not have breakfast or drinks in hotel so cannot comment on catering services reception staff very helpful and friendly well located easy and interesting to walk round arrdmts   and   and   plenty to discover in those three other than eiffel tower la cite de l architecture in palais de chaillot truly excellent especially the currently running world war i exhibition lots of traditional very good bars bistrots and brasseries in all three arrdmts zinc and la gauloise in   and cafe a la fontaine in   excellent the latter produces its own special raspberry liqueur metro and rer only   metres away at javel station layout of bathroom facilities in   separate toilet and shower room not ideal as no sink in toilet room also wardrobe opened into the shower room where it would make more sense to have door into main bedroom area clean room location ideal for our trip staff helpful and friendly no negative excellent staff helped us getting to disneyland and other locations and made us feel very welcome rooms were very clean looked amazing and modern they even had the english football on even though it was commentated in french so you can t complain no negative the staff was very helpfull and serviceminded great location only  min walk from eiffeltower and only  min walk from a shopping mall everything was great and again a big star to all the staff that made everything so easy for ur stay cant find any maybe b fast is a bit overpriced but dats really negligible great location     mins walk from eiffel tower beaugrenelle shopping mall round the corner italian kebab bakery off license next door and javel metro station round the corner great staff available     very warm helpful luggage n to go around and caring beautiful room modern deco very clean spacious well equipped room   various facilities printing of boarding pass keeping of luggage before check in and after check out others clean lobby smell soooo deliciously christmassy both stairs n lifts overall above expectations for a budget hotel keep up the good workno negative this hotel about a half block from a metro station it s also convenient to a grocery store and about three blocks from restaurants the room was very comfortable the staff friendly and helpful this was supposed to be a romantic anniversary trip i did inform them beforehand requesting for a high level room and or quiet room and or room with outside view we were given non of the requested upon arrival we were given room   on the first floor our view was pipes we could hear people restaurants throwing trash out and speaking loudly i understand that these requests are based on availability but it seemed like it was the worst room available the air con was inconsistent on the first night it was hot and the next night it was cold despite the same temperature setting you could hear the toilet pipework from the building which was really off putting modern design of the rooms small rooms but good use of space the hotel location is not as mention on the booking and the room also not as mention in the booking com the housekeeping peoples came lots of time in the room without permission without knock no positive all of the room with view have a separated toilet the ones with the toilet included in the bathroom are on the back yard except our room   which was on the  st floor with no view ofcourse a separated toilet is not suitable for all travelers like us location is perfect near the metro rer river and the eiffel tower the great advantage is that it is near beau grenelle mall so the location has every thing i wanted didn t bother with breakfast as it is overpriced at   euro best to go to a nearby cafe although wifi is available it keeps cutting out and you need to keep reregistering staff really helpful when we were asking for advice and when we ran out of tea bags they searched the hotel for extras there was a speed limit on wifi no video streaming means no youtube or any other video services high wifi speed paid serviceno positive feeling pressure due to low ceiling of garret on top floor good and nice attitude of all staffs so close to metro javel station only   seconds heating was not functioning they have to bring us an electric heater also bath room split was not comfortable location and view of the room i did not like the selection of the breakfast needed more choice the shower was wetting up the floor needed some tv station in englishno positiveno negative staff were friendly courteous helpful in every respect i did not have the proper charger for my i phone and the staff provided me with one the key of the room is big it is not a card like all hotels so you will have to place it in reception interior design of rooms was amazingno negative we loved your hotel everyone was very nice and the hotel was beautiful the dacor was exceptional and the rooms are fab they are cheating in web site what ever mentioned in booking com is not true i think booking and the hotel are lying together so they force the customers baying the first night nothing it is the worest hotel i ever been in my lifeno negative feels like home a really nice home a   min walk to harrods go for a run around hyde park or down to buckingham and around st james park all within minutes close to bar boulud a great spot for dinner last stop at the honesty bar for a nightcap its not a five star hotel it has some rooms in the basement it has no big lobby it has no breakfast buffet the pictures of the hotel doesnt reflect the hotel fro out side doesnt look like as ahotel it looks as normal residence no positive lack of window dressing in the bathroom felt a bit weird had a piece of opaque glass which covered   of the window but didn t feel that comfortable having a shower so put a towel over the other part of the window the hotel has a really nice feel about it it s not too big and so feels cosy the other guests seem normal too and the staff weren t up themselves lovely and clean and beautiful food nothing this is a lovely boutique hotel in the knightsbridge area fifth time we stayed here decor of rooms is excellent comfortable beds and we had a magnificent bathroom excellent food serviced for breakfast lunch or dinnerno negative very friendly service team relaxed yet elegant and efficient the shower is one of the best i have experienced in london with great water pressure harrods is literally around the corner i d definitely stay here again we ordered some beverage items to be sent up to the rooms they never arrived so we had to re order not impressed a smart room excellent bed and air con that worked efficiently during very hot weather polite and helpful staff the room that you could eat your breakfast in was far too small for a busy hotel so we had breakfast in our suite which was lovely but if i had to gripe it was slightly uncomfortable perched on a sofa and bending down onto a coffee table very light and spacious nothing in regards the hotel although now i know there are no front facing deluxe rooms i would reserve a different room type next time its also a bit expensive in our view but at least you know that up front the location the fact it is not a huge hotel so you are treated more as a person rather than a number the d cor in the rooms and the fact each one is different the type of building its a relaxing place to stay amongst the bustle of london nothing to say location and and comfort of the hotel was really excellent drawing room and library were nice place to chat with someone and or have some tea they don t have any restaurants in their hotel but they have  h room services we didn t use the service for meal so i can t make any comment for that all i wanted after a very long flight from australia was a cup of tea room service was prompt however quite expensive although it maybe common to have a kettle in the room it had all the other comforts you would find so being able to make a cup of tea would have been perfect it was however served in a beautiful pot so i guess that made up for it on two occasions we other guests were asked to leave the drawing room so that a guest could interview someone seemed rather inconvenient overall good gorgeous interiors fairly unsuitable for children unless of course you are booking a seperate room great bathroom products the public rooms always seemed to be totally occupied by the same guests it really didn t allow for us to enjoy them very much the room was lovely with a lovely view and the bathroom was great i loved that at almost     pm we were able to get sandwiches that were freshly made and delivered promptly to two very hungry people there is nothing i didn t like about this hotel i liked the quaint cozy atmosphere and the two sitting rooms much different from a large hotel i definitely prefer this beautiful eclectic upscale boutique hotel to any of the large luxury hotels i have stayed in the staff was friendly and accommodating but not intrusive just very professional although breakfasts were good for the most part room service choices were limited and extremely bland and flavourless superb location lovely staff and great interior design i think the reception is very simple compared to the over all interior of the hotel the cuisine and service is good i stayed at the junior suite color green and i found the layout of the ro perfect with   big windows however i was so disappointed at the size of the hotel and the lack of facilities i e a proper restaurant or bar i have stayed at the charlotte street hotel on numerous occasions and to be honest was expecting similar facilities the staff were highly trained and very pleasant breakfast was good but should be included in price but apart from that all good bed was really comfortable hotel was easy to get too staff were polite and helpful the rooms are quite compact and therefore eating breakfast which is served in the room is a bit awkward breakfast was not as hot as it might be if they had a restaurant comfy bed no heating in very large bathroom radiator not working staff informed rectified but still remained very cold eventually moved to larger room breakfast was very slow no dinning room taken in lounge area beautiful boutique hotel the bed in our room was very high unusually high but comfortable the room was not very big either adequate for our one night stay boutique style hotel with lovely decor very near the shops in knightsbridge very kindly called us a taxi to our venue when we needed one can t think of anything slept like a log definately one of the best hotels i have ever used superb decor absolutely spotless and attentive but unobtrusive staff correcting the breakfast bill with staff still ringing to check our order staff adding a continental breakfast we had a great time but this soured the experience a bit the breakfast arrived later than the allocated time it was very nice but items were left off what we originally ordered when we went to reception to checkout we found they had added another continental breakfast this made the bill skyrocket a word of advice try not to forget anything left in your room no matter how small as you will be charged for a stamp i had an incident where an employee barged into my room when i had a do not disturb sign on at   a m this made me jump out of my bed scared for dear life i obviously called the front desk asking for an explanation and they simply replied that they have been told of the incident by the employee who mixed up the rooms and they have informed the manager a couple of days pass and i hear nothing from them i called the manager and asked if she knew what happened she confirmed and simply said that the employee needed to be reminded of what a do not disturb sign meant i mean i would appreciate it more if they have done more than just saying that i don t know send a free fruit basket whatever it is it is hard for me to fall asleep in general and then someone barges in without even knocking it really frightened me and of course couldn t go back to sleep spacious room room service is pretty quick nice location no negative everything was amazing staff helpful room divine bed so comfortable shower and bathroom faultless location quiet relaxing atmosphere and breakfast perfect a rather small back of house bedroom which was either boiling hot or feeeziing cold depending on whether you wanted to be in air con fug or have the window open breakfast in the sitting room had very slow service with one poor waitress trying her best location decorationno negative hotel is perfectly located for shopping and long walks the rooms are gorgeous we stayed in a jr suite loved it nothing is a problem for the warm helpful staff a real homey cosy restful feeling here it wasn t possible to switch off the extraction in our bathroom i personally didn t hear a thing but my partner is a very light sleeper lovely staff extremely nice and very helpful excellent showers very comfortable beds interior design colorful and cosy and at the same time exceptionally tasteful the english breakfast was disappointing in that it was undercooked to the point that we both sent it back to be fair we weren t charged for it but as we were only there for one night and we both really enjoy our food and look forward to a cooked breakfast when away it was a disappointing finale to the trip room was clean and comfortable there is always a smell in the bathrooms since before i arrived i asked for a late check out coz my plane was late they didnt let me stay too long the location and the staff the breakfast was a set charge of   so very expensive if all you want is a hot drink and a pastry the staff were so welcoming and the hotel was absolutely perfect and felt so comfortable and inviting the room although small it was a single was a delight and the bathroom fantastic i was booked at the lower floor as i have requested for twin beds the architect of the beautiful hotel should be penalised for not installing a sound proof flooring all the movements at the lounge can be heard in my room and when the cleaners came to vacuum the lounge at   am it woke me up every morning of my   day stay everything else was perfect the room was very large and has a gorgeous bathroom and the save the best baguette for breakfast room service menu can be better with additional plates checked all room types recommend each in terms of space storage space and interior design by kit kemp very good location in a silent street nice lobby and friendly staff value per m  is optimum when compared to other hotels in the same range ms food and waitrose are at   min walk compared to other places i stayed in europe the price is still high although the pound dropped in value excellent room service all staff very helpful and friendly the size of the room breakfast was poor best option to eat out at many of the cafes in the area and internet was slow avoid room in the basement because you will wake up early with people walking in the livingroom above where breakfast is served large and well decorated room nice bed large flat screen tv staff very friendly overall very cosy and comfortable hotel nothing the staff were wonderful and very helpful and the location was the best the little extra touches like complimentary chocolate and room spray which were delivered to the door and the shower was fabulous as in your home you will find no gym no pool service was good but not amazing which you would expect from a very small hotel such as this the hotel feels like a home and is very cosy i feel it was all perfect the friendly and very helpful staff was a pleasure the cleanliness of our room superb and just the overall feel of the hotel was great no negative great location in the middle of everything yet quite and cozy customer oriented and professional staff clean and v nicely decorated room in room spa services highly recommended and would definitely stay in the knightsbridge hotel again no negative beautiful decor individually designed rooms with very comfortable beds convenient location in an interesting area close to tube and bus transport unfortunately a lot of things but most importantly there are security issues with the hotel during my first night a housekeeper just barged into the room unannounced and unapologetic about it while i was sleeping given that this is not a standard practice of any hotel esp that they should always knock before they enter things got worse the last day of my check out they checked in a guest into one of my rooms i booked two at   am before i check out i even entered the room thinking it was still mine with my key and found the new guest already sleeping on the bed and shocked when they saw me come into the room that was completely absurd and never heard of especially in a supposedly   star hotel when i checked into this hotel twice i was given the rooms after  pm so to actually check in a guest into an unchecked room before  am was a rip off to me to make things even worse after at least   minutes of arguing with the manager about it they were not taking responsibility he did not apologize for this until i demanded an apology i have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior of staff ever in any of my travels around the world and in any hotels i have been to i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone other things worth mentioning rooms are the smallest i have seen out of all the hotels i have been in london breakfast was very limited and dull sometimes it was a little challenging getting a taxi to the hotel the location was good the design of the interiors was beautiful designed by the famous kit kemp the attention to details in terms of design was notable   room is very small you can hardly move around it with very little soace around the bid   small tight corridors for a   star rated hotel   for   per night you d expect some kind of a veiw what we got is view at a brick wall seriously we were told the street view is for other type of rooms with higher rates   flat tv is too small staff is very nice and polite room service cleaning was superb they have cleaned our room twice in one day bathroom and toiletry rik rak is fabilious you can really enjoy a shower the house cleaning service is not the best the maid did not organise the items in the bathroom neatly and the maids did not stack up my magazine and other items nicely also i think for a   star hotel it should have a coffee machine free tea bags for customer the hotel is quiet and the suite is nice staffs are not helpful out of my   nights stay and probably     different staffs i have encountered day and night there are only   lady at front desk and   gentlemen helping me with luggages are nice the rest is either cold or not helpful at all i like the deco cleaness and the high quality amenity the boutique use size of the room very small the cost doesn t justify the size of the room the hotel also doesn t have a proper restaurant although there are options nearby location friendly staff clean boutique no negative friendly staff very comfortable rooms and though they dont have a restaurant the food from the kitchen is top notch best english breakfast ive had no negative the staff were incredibly helpful and nice my mother and i stayed for   nights we loved the relaxed comfortable environment the location was excellent i would highly recommend for all ages it would be helpful to have a larger bottle of water in the room delicous breakfast eggs cooked perfectly served in record time very good and hot tea extremely friendly and helpful staff at reception will definitely stay here again and recommend to others great location in middle of knightsbridge which still manages to offer very peaceful rooms with no noise from traffic the room was very small decently appointed but very small the minibar pricing was even mote outrageous than normal the staff was exceptionally attentive as it was only a saturday night stay in the hotel it was difficult to find any negatives if the stay was longer we are sure we would of struggled to find anything we will return without doubt next time we fancy a night up town classy hotel with very friendly staff that made us feeel very welcome on our arrival we normally stay in larger hotels but we loved the upmarket boutique feel of the knightsbridge hotel we did not spend a huge amount of time in the hotel but we were made to feel very special during our short stay price could have been better wasn t cheap bed was very comfy but the staff were an asset to the hotel very helpful and warming and did their upmost to meet our needs really would have liked a kettle in the room for early morning cup of tea the rooms were rather small but everything was there very comfortable hotel in peaceful location and the service was excellent very attentive staff nothing was too much trouble for them nothing beautiful property excellent location friendly efficient and discreet service wonderful decor very clean and fashionable chic and beautiful can t wait to visit again and again no negative the staff were very welcoming the street was quiet everything about the hotel was lovely we were upgraded to a presidential suite which was amazing and had the most wonderful time room so small we could barely fit with our suitcases love kit kemp and her creative interiors staff attentive and love the location room beautifully decorated small cozy clean lovely no negative it is an excellent boutique hotel the rooms are fantastic spacious and well decorated the bathrooms are large and very modern the location is superb absolutely nothing the whole stay was perfect the staff made one feel special and couldn t do enough the bed divine the shower brilliant recommeneded a coffee machine for the rooms i loved everything in this hotel its so cosy specially the staff is so friendly and helpfulno negative wonderful hotel with extremely friendly staff i stayed there for   nights with my   year old daughter and we both enjoyed it very much the a c in our room was on my head but this is first time this has happened there staff great and breakfast was really good the rooms were lacking plugs to charge our phones and ipads room was large as well as bathroom and decent location the hotel was obvious a going place as the lobby which had a bar and pool table were full of young people having a wonderful time the staff from the front desk to the doormen were friendly and helpful the view from my room was of a dirty inner courtyard but it didn t bother me too much as i only stayed one night the staff were friendly and helpful the decor in the room had a trendy scandinavian look the bars are all fantastic my only complaint about the room is that you can hear a lot of hallway noise through the doors but it wasn t bad enough to not stay here again i wasn t a fan of berners tavern off the lobby while the restaurant is beautiful the food was quite poor except the dessert and was a real disappointment very friendly and helpful staff rooms are perfectly laid out and feel very spacious bed was comfortable huge immaculate bathroom location is convenient and easy to walk to many shops restaurants and bars i really liked the lobby bar and the drinks were well made overall had a great stay and would stay again at edition nothing it was perfect we stayed here for our wedding night plus an additional night they made us feel so welcome and added a few treats to the room on our arrival food was divine the bathroom was fantastic staff were wonderful and friendly we will definitely be coming back nothing really not the cheapest room in london but i wasn t looking for the cheapest great staff beautiful rooms and amazing lobby and restaurant tavern this place smells like heaven really the rooms had a kind of sparse minimalist feel to them and they had one of those strange pictures of a woman s head whose eyes followed you around the room the light switches were also quite strange and not the easiest to operate excellent staff very helpful and very friendly when there was a problem with the bathroom it was sorted to our satisfaction the restaurant was fantastic and the fixed lunch menu excellent value difficult to connect to the wifi at first i found the room a little small despite choosing a higher category check out was very long as there was a queue loved the friendliness of the staff especially in the restaurant they sent up special complimentary cocktails for us to enjoy the weekend beautiful hotel restaurant breakfast brunch choices were excellent the quality of the restaurant food was very high excellent stay overall standard double bedroom is very small request high floor bedroom to avoid noise from bar restaurant excellent bar great atmosphere berners taverner food really good with lively atmosphere all staff very helpful despite requesting a room with a bath at booking time six months prior to arrival we were initially allocated a room without a bath they changed us without any fuss but it would have been better if it hadn t happened at all bed was amazing the bathroom was great the food delicious but the staff showed fantastic professionalism and customer service without being over the top we stayed in a loft room which was very nice but also relatively expensive so it s surprising that the in room extras were so distinctly lacking the shampoo conditioner and shower gel were tiny and by not being an established brand it makes them in any case feel cheap there was also no toothpaste or toothbrushes perhaps even more disappointing though was that we had to order tea from room service surely a base expectation in any hotel is that you can make a cup of tea added to which the coffee machine only had two capsules and no fresh milk also quite why you would make people pay for films just offer the sky movies like most other decent hotels as a comparison the dean street townhouse is similarly priced but they provide full sized bottles of the full range of their cowshed products in the room this is an established brand and a very nice touch they also provide toothbrushes and toothpaste etc recognising that you may not want to bring this with you for short stays there is also ample coffee pods tea options and fresh milk generally it feels like a far more personal experience if honest for the best part of     i spent on a one night stay for the the room drinks and dinner at the london edition i feel more could be done to make the experience about the customer rather than the profit margin nice room in an impressive building great restaurant and cocktails the concierge who was rude and arrogant to two female members of our party on separate occasions the attention to detail of staff was truly exceptional we were there over christmas and the staff made the experience one to remember no negative the london edition was amazing discovery situated near oxford street it s within walking distance to a subway station soho piccadilly the staff was very helpful and friendly the punch bar at the back of the hotel is definitely worth the try the room is very spacious and the minibar is just sublime this is being a little picky but i would have liked a dressing table with a mirror with lights to put my makeup on instead of standing in the bathroom where the lit mirror was perfect as there was no place to rest your make up apart from the wet sink an the full length mirror was in the living area an the lighting of the room was quite dim with no option of having stronger lights on we had a loft suite an the view was great an we had a huge terrace which would be amazing in the nicer weather if i stayed here again i would request the same room absolutely nothing the legant and welcoming lobby outstanding restaurant food and atmosphere very friendly considerate and professional staff caring and perceptive way of dealing with children perfect problem solving comfortable cosy and stylish room best shower ever our daughter is very fond of this hotel staff at the punch bar were a little brusque and somewhat dismissive even though we had made reservations very stylish lobby and nice ambience the adjoining restaurant is very good the location is very convenient receptionist staff and doormen very polite and friendly no negative the location of the hotel is excellent soho  mins away and oxford st at your doorstep all staff were genuinely friendly and accommodating the ambience of the hotel is very hip and youthful also not forgetting the magnificent decor no matter wha the buttermilk pancakes is a must try for breakfast at berners tavern consirege he recommended a dreadful restaurant and wasn t very on the ball with other suggestions also hotel guests are not prioritized for the onsite restaurant and it s always fully booked so don t just turn up and stay thinking you have a table super cool hotel great restaurant amazing location spanish lady called isabella is seriously slick sorts everything out and very attentive proper hustle and bustle but in a very organized way impressive location if you have meetings some minor staff issues first ended up in a room that was already taken free cakes as compensation were taken out off the room before i could eat them also free internet did not work at first as my name was misspelled friendly staff though while other ian schrager hotels often felt like a rip off with small rooms and high charges for all kinds of extras this concept offers better value for money big room free water and of course a great design and atmosphere no bath just a shower the staff are wonderful nothing was a problem and every recommendation they made for restaurants etc were fantastic the hotel is fabulous and berners restaurant and the   bars had a great vibe wifi was extremely bad kept disconnecting and completely unreliable ruined the experience throughout my entire stay room service menu as well as my one time lunch in the restaurant the menu is small and food wasn t as good as expected and definitely wasn t worth the price paid location room cleanliness as well as comfort bedding pillows sheets was above expectations and very satisfying when booked thru booking no marriot spg points and nights no space for private meetings or to talk on the phone besides your own room there is no separation between lobby and bar so things get a little messy room service very unprofessional and expensive restaurant beautiful but the food is not on the same level expensive hotel no loyalty program interesting hotel beautiful modern room nice concierge service very good location room request as i have stayed in before not available and room not ready for early check in everything else was outstanding room substitute was just ok but overall service excellentno positive probably the only thing is that the bread at breakfast was plain kind of white bread it would be better if they understand bread has moved on from light useless white bread even white bread doesn t want to be white bread anymore whole grain multigrain sourdough dark rye etc is way better super comfy bed very nice and helpful staff great looking facilities beautiful foyer perhaps a strange like but we liked we could actually open the window even though it was just a little bit overall excellent well we did see a mouse in the bar downstairs but i m sure the hotel is dealing with the issue and having worked many years in central london i am far from naive in this respect those things happen it s the most amazing hotel with a very unique atmosphere the attention to detail is on another level we loved it and will be back as soon as possible rooms are rather small yet this is the case with most hotels in london staff was extremely friendly and helpful incredibly convenient location and of course bath amenities made specifically for the hotel no negative very nice hotel although rather expensive straff very friendly when we arrived in the afternoon the rooms were not ready yet but to compensate the inconveniences they offered us an upgrade very good attitude guaranteed check in time is   pm but we had to wait longer the service at berners tavern during breakfast was consistently very slow the hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom due to lack of power outlet maybe this is due to security policy but certainly an inconvenience superior room is big enough with a big rain shower which we loved however there wasnt ample wardrobe space or drawers lobby area is quiet nice concierge is amazingly helpful and very quick to reply all the staff was very helpful and nice actually the room was cold in feeling with very little furniture and no place to put things it was also less than i paid for but i paid ahead of time and they would not change it i blame booking com for thatno positive overpriced and only deserving of a   star rating the superior room we got was tiny horribly hot with a view over the service yard the room didn t have basic facilities like an iron and coffee or tea facilities which in a   star was a bit poor the decor was so sparse and cheaply finished in the bedrooms felt more ikea than premium you also need to reserve in advance a table in the punch bar even if you are a hotel guest which would have been helpful to know before arriving or even when checking in but we only found this out when we went to go for a drink and were rudely turned away overall an underwhelming   star hotel well located with a good lobby vibe very small room even with an upgrade but this is common in london unless you pay for a suite otherwise rooms very high standard incredible location with extremely well trained staff the entire ambience of the place makes it one of the best hotels in central london a real treatno negative i love how the staff pay close attention on the specific requirement of the customer i asked for the scary looking woman painting in the room to be removed and the staff sure did remove them from the room like i have requested very impressive it was difficult to find   seats in the bar as a hotel guest they made an error with the bill as charged us for breakfast which we had already paid lovely bedroom very modern bed was huge comfy pillows very good quality breakfast and attentive staff the only problem i face was they didn t have my booking number i stayed for one hour at front desk trying to explain to them that i booked   months ago it shows then that they didnt get the comfermation from booking and after that they want to charge me with a room rate that is higher that what i book tell i manage to get access to my booking and show them all the details and price the room the matress was perfect the location friendly staff nil the london edition is exactly that a brilliant encapsulation of everything that is london in a cool and contemporary hotel ian schrager at his best breakfast not included in rate was expensive we had a view of construction site that was opposite hotel no bath great restaurant staff location beautiful building rooms good but no bath was disappointing the rooms are expensive enough but they charge for every little detail and the bar is very very expensive the central position for shopping soho theatres nothing stayed for new year s eve because we wanted to celebrate and were not disappointed decor comfort welcome cocktails in room and upgraded room lovely toiletries great shower room comfortable and quiet wonderful restaurant fab new years special menu cocktails and great breakfast faultless service rooms are not as luxious as the rest of the hotel the staff is adorable the public spaces are beautiful lobby bar restaurant localisation the wood panelling of the rooms is not to everyone s taste at night we had a choice between being too hot air con off or constant humming air con on until i found out that the windows do open which resulted in air con going into overdrive fabulous location for soho and theatreland we walked down to the gielgud in about  min awesome interior design of lobby snd restaurant very comfy bed luxurious bathroom and massive well placed flatscreen and the black tea scent permeating the whole place by le labo is just intoxicating the room was too cold air conditioning not working no spare toilet paper nor toilet brush the room was not very comfortable and had a weird sour smell the lobby was also cold and the staff was friendly but not really   star standard a lot of details were not taken care of such as taking dirty dishes away by room service bad lighting in the room no electronic plug in the bathroom for hair drying food drinks were good room service quite quick and  h a day the location of the hotel is perfect design of the lobby is nice and modern we were able to have early check in and late check out oh dear i can put up with the water leak at   am in the morning and having to move rooms these things happen i m not impressed with being told that my room is not available at check in and would i like an upgrade for more money i suspect someone is on performance related bonuses very suspicious of that one valet parking forgot to get my car when i checked out made me late for meeting not impressed attention from staff excellent didn t love the service in the dining hall and bar area also wish there was an outlet in the bathroom i love how modern yet cocoon like the rooms are and how the building is old beautiful and well updated also love that it s a popular hotel but is supremely quiet and clean in the rooms the room service is delicious as is the food in the dining hall service is pretty impeccable i wouldn t want to stay anywhere else when visiting london even though i booked a room to accommodate   adult and   children we had to share a king sized bed i was originally offered a queen which i spent most of the night trying not to fall out of great location service f b beautiful interiors no negative weird that there is no swimming pool or sauna for a   star however the staff were more than willing to escort us to these if we wanted to wait time for breakfast too long but hotel more than made up for this nice comfy bed with plenty of pillows and plenty of towels even for a superior room the room was small i loved the design of the hotel the lobby bar and berners tavern are amazing the view from the room the design was great and the staff was extremely friendly the lobby also becomes a very hip lounge in the evening i booked again a few days later and they charged me more than less than a week ago helpfull staff comfy beds and room was charged through booking and on arrival money was ultimately refunded but it required my input to do it hotel in itself is amazing no negative the loft suite is extremely comfortable and the wood on the walls makes it very cozy the artwork is powerful too the service and staff are very low the room was dirty staines all over the curtains terrace with dirty pillows and wet kitchen smell all day long coming inside the room no positive our room was situated on the ground floor as it had a delightful terrace however the plants were just dull and even some were dead no colour and yet what an opportunity to really wow your guests with area that could be filled with scent colour from climbers at very little cost in addition to this because we had to pass the kitchen entrance and the door was always open the smell and heat hit you as you were walking down there was always staff standing in the doorway and even if you said hello they would just look at you and carry on talking to each other so it made you feel a little uncomfortable we did have some previous guests smelly socks left in one of the draws but one call to reception and the actual lady on the desk came and dealt with it straight away the hotel is just great we have stayed before but it would seem they have new staff now and it made all the difference from our last trip the lady that greeted us was wonderful as was the lady that assisted her just really very professional but by no means over the top an absolute pleasure excellent hotel normally however this is a one off had it not been for a quick turnaround from the previous guests they would have normally spotted a broken glass in the bathroom also the breakfast tray didn t have any croissants as they had run out staff need to more understanding of their guests as their english isn t brilliant manage was very nice though fab location gorgeous designer hotel love the interior too easy to get to ac was our of order replaced by a noisy transportable device continental breakfast was small though coffee was very good far from the typical lousy english variety good location on a quiet street not far from gloucester road tube station room had very little noise as it faced the yard fridge in the room the room was rather small though perhaps not really by london standards but with an unusually high ceiling must be   m tall no aircon made sleeping difficult we stayed at the hotel with another couple and the air con in their room was also broken we asked after the first night and were told someone would bring some air con units to the rooms they never appeared in either room we did mention this when checking out and no compensation was offered lovely hotel very clean nice environment excellent location the big fat loud air conditioning unit at the foot of the bed had to squeeze past it to get into bed the big hose hung out the window looking ugly a small attic room didn t help matters so i cannot say i felt like it was worth the money location was spot on having no tea making facilities in room temperature of room humidifier made one side of bedroom sodden noisy all night humidifier could not turn off as too hot having to pay fifteen quid for two teas and two coffees staff on arrival no coffee facilities in room air con didn t seem to be working very quiet for a central london hotel comfy bed convenient for gloucester road tube station plenty of local restaurants chipped sink water stains in blinds and curtains decor a little dated and could benefit from a make over noisy ineffective portable air conditioning unit provided in room no slippers provided in room overpriced snacks and mini bar crisps   small bottle of wine   overpriced continental breakfast tea juice and toast approx   would also benefit if hotel provided tea and coffee making facilities in room lovely location quirky building hotel very helpful friendly staff leaving and getting a good nights sleep when a i got home the bed was great really comfy we had the attic room which had a stand alone air con system which had a large exhaust pipe that had to go out the window so the window had to stay open all night you could not close the curtains as there was a large pipe in the way if you kept the air con on it would wake you up all night as it went on and off and being the attic it was very warm me and my partner had   nights of very poor sleep the room also does not have any tea or coffee facilities on the first morning of our stay at the back of   i phone room service for a tea and coffee the phone rang and rang but to no avail i was on the phone twice for   mins no answer p s as you could not shut the curtains as soon as it was light that was you up the windows was meant to have   blinds but there was only   as the other   had been taken down so they could put the pipe out the window and when i say pipe it was massive like the ones you get with a tumble dryer so the window had to be open at least  cm which was great for all the buglife but nobody else never have i spent so much for a room and got so little old fashioned hotel needs a serious renovation carpet in the hotel is from the   s the air condition in the room is a very noisy hired unit which stands on the floor staff is mostly from eastern europe where they don t write hospitality with a capital h the hotel is completely over priced the area around gloucester road south kensington is very nice however try to book another hotel the air conditioning wasn t working the front desk sent up a portable unit but it made so much noise that we couldn t sleep with it on after the first night we said that we couldn t stay without aircon and they said that the aircon wasn t working in the entire hotel and hadn t for a week we asked to checkout and to pay for the night we stayed and that we would find alternative accommodation for the balance of our stay the general manager agreed while we were there and then reneged on the deal i ended up double paying my accommodation for the period there was also someone else s underwear in the drawer when we checked in i am a very unhappy customer the staff at the front desk were very helpful and the location is good there were no tea making facilities in the room which was a bit disappointing although staff did offer to bring tea up to our room which was nice the staff were welcoming and friendly the bed was very comfortable the location and interior design was pleasant the air conditioning didn t work properly took long time to check in small reception area not enough staff good size charming very good food at the restaurant but breakfast was poor breakfast was poor not good value for money both in terms of quantity and quality there was not tea and coffee making facility in the room apparently for safety reasons however it is now standard to find this in a hotel in london the staff was polite and available but in some cases slow and not clumsy coffe with no spoon or sugar cappuccino instead of latte etc there is a pitcher of lemon water and cake upon arrival and the staff is very attentiv and helpful ther bed was exta confortable and there were different kinds of pillows firm fluffy etc also the duvet was not too heavy therfore the temperature was perfect the room was elegant quiet and large easily the best i have stayed in in london the espresso is illy and made the italian way the location is fantastici for this part of town no negative the room was very large and the decorations excellent a fabulous staff great breakfast and we had dinner in the hotel and it was fantastic the location is amazing   blocks from a tube station and very close to museu ms and shopping nice birthday treat for my wife was planned with a weekend in london cranley hotel soon changed that   star really this should not be   star where to start with what is wrong with this so called   star hotel first of all checking in we were told our room number   fourth floor but lift only goes to third floor opening our door to the room we were instantly hit by the heat it was stifling even though window was open and it wasn t that hot outside under the window was a portable air con unit nice and noisy the carpet was stained and had a rip in it curtain had a large round stain on it the bed headboard was the worst of all filthy brown stains the room never cooled at all and we had to sleep on top of bedding in the morning half way through my shower no water phoned reception was told he would phone back in  mins which he did was told to try now no explanation or apology breakfast was a joke continental haha toast or pastry fruit juice tea or coffee that was it if you have booked to stay here remember the room number       if you are given this room refuse instantly nothing we booked superior suite and they gave the room in basement   floor beds are old and worn out even bedheads are fractured long story short the hotel needs reconditioning location lobby was non existent just a desk at the front door looked unprofessional scary elevator first room was unacceptable basement level no view smelt of dirt  nd room was better top floor nice view no a c great restaurants nearby television not working replaced with one that needed to be re programmed no running water to begin with it was then turned on but there was no hot water shame the management and sloppy facilities didn t live up to the very good staff staff were excellent needs refreshing in some areas the carpet in room was very old stained and had an open seam that was a tripping hazard no kettle for tea or coffee in the room convenient location pleasant staff comfortable bed room was bright and very quiet linen very fresh and new nothing the staff was just incredible and the restaurant top notch it is persian room beautiful too would definitely stay here again a great neighborhood as the staff and service were so terrible we asked if the hotel had changed hands in the past and it had which came as no surprise in every aspect you could tell the hotel was trying to save money breakfast was extremely petit my husband was served one tiny bun for breakfast which was supposed to be wholemeal but wasn t the staff were terribly rude no one helped us with the luggage on arrival morning breakfast a young man from the front desk was the only person there in the morning he came to us hands in pockets and was extremely rude telling us are breakfast could not be served as we were too early luckily i had a photo of our breakfast card and the time it was ordered when i said the time he wanted to argue about it we would have been satisfied with beverages and we waited anyway but he took a lot of persuading just to get us some tea the breakfast service was extremely slow as in everyone was waiting one morning to be served no one had breakfast and the whole restaurant was full bathroom had long hairs stuck to the wall we had to ask twice that is should be cleaned the rooms looked cute were very small it s a shame that the people in the hotel with the exception of one foreign lady serving breakfast did her utmost to help were so rude and unhelpful if you do stay here because the location is fantastic have breakfast somewhere else there are lots of nice restaurants nearby and don t expect any british politeness breakfast not worth it ridiculous attitude very few items on the table small jam pots     per person bad slow service bathroom not clean people at front desk rude and impolite lazy hotel is trying to save money on things breakfast number of towels in bathroom what we liked the picture of the bed on booking com the one and only person who took any care about people in the breakfast room people used to modern motel suites might find the rooms small and the building old fashioned but i thought the building charming and the room just right for someone who plans to be out and about all day i don t like the new addition of dinner service because the kitchen smells waft up to the rooms and there are plenty of restaurants nearby the only complimentary toiletries were a very basic shampoo conditioner and soap it would make the room instantly more luxurious if they offered more luxurious bed and towels good lighting quiet location offer of tea and petit fours on arrival boutique antique decor the improved wireless access system constant pressure to eat dinner at their iranian restaurant the latter being a swift transformation of the lounge by putting cutlery and napkins on the tables a big mistake in my view location was excellent the shower room was small not a deal breaker for me but might be for some although the shower itself was a good size a little bit of wear and tear in some areas but no worse than in any other busy hotel the hotel was like a georgian country house transplanted into london lovely room and so quiet i normally use earplugs in london but there was no noise at all and the bed was very comfortable a mobile phone for guests from overseas was a nice touch although i didn t need it myself proper hangers and a good sized bathrobe were a refreshing change the shower was very powerful like getting a rub down from a soviet masseuse would definitely recommend for people who don t want ultra modern decor and prefer some old fashioned touches but still want all mod cons the air conditioning unit did not work requests from the in room menu were always not available except persian choices i was informed the restaurant is persian now and only items from the banu menu are available that menu which was added to the rear of the in room folder also listed the cranley burger fish chips and all other items on the in room menu however as stated above such items were not available on the three occasions i used room service despite being listed as an available item there was no bath robe should one wish to have a coffee or tea in your room it is necessary to order it via room service the choice available for the basic breakfast was poor so i went to a well known grocers on piccadilly for breakfast no positive the hotel has started to offer dinner a mistake i think since there are good restaurants very close by at a range of prices and styles also the smell from the kitchens at night in my room overlooking the back was rather pervasive quiet convenient location superb well trained staff boutique hotel quality decor in rooms no skimping on bed linens and towels complimentary tea or coffee on arrival which can be taken in one s room water in glass bottles at bedside also complimentary water supply was interrupted several times during a   days stay making it uncomfortable to shower did not provide any welcome drink as advertised bed was comfortable good location room was small and worn out poor repair finish curtains had been out in the rain at some point and you could not use the toilet seat without burning yourself on the towel dryer no positive room keys though it is so original but have to leave each time like old days very nice hotel and so lovely british overall environment location is perfect and the area is so quite but very near to the main public transportation and restaurants nice small three tables outside to have morning coffee nothing to complain about with this hotel the victorian decor of this hotel was beautiful a nice change from all these modern plastic hotels these days lovely rooms with high ceilings and very clean reception area very small and facilities limited would have liked coffee and tea making facilities in the room lovely sized room continental breakfast very nice the place needs updated i have been using this hotel for   plus years and notice the bathrooms etc are very tired the staff especially derek were extremely helpdul everything sadly this hotel trades on its location and photographs i ve stayed in much better bed and breakfasts i can only assume the star rating is self appointed no one answered the phone when i called prior to arrival to ask about parking of which there is none when we did arrive the receptionist was so devoid of human emotion i assumed he was a badly automated robot the first room had a chinese water torture device constantly dripping gurgling ac unit fitted as an unwelcome addition the second room lacked basics like tea coffee a kettle etc the position of our executive room was in the basement next to the kitchen so we were woken at  am on a sunday by the chef juggling the crockery breakfast was a joke having paid extra for an inclusive breakfast we were told we only qualified for the continental breakfast which was a basket of luke warm limp bread optimistically described as toast and a cafetiere filled with dishwater equally optimistically described as coffee anything beyond that including cereals was additional the service at breakfast was appalling i was unsure at which point beadle was going to jump out and let me in on the gag its a beautiful building but as a hotel its trading on its south ken credentials very hard any where else it would struggle location was ideal for the purpose of our stay in london large room for london and very comfortable huge bed my welcome cup of tea was cold and we didn t seem to have hot water out of the sink taps it was barely luke warm yet the radiators were very hot and actually the temperature of the room was too hot absolutely delightful place staff really friendly and welcoming and helpful really quaint and walking distance from the tube in very nice area and lots of restaurants pubs to visit in close range extra bed too uncomfortable not much space and or comfort for a junior suite this was the third time we had stayed at the cranley and it was slightly disappointing despite the polite staff no positive a little tlc with paintwork and carpets a shower cap and hair drier would have been great lovely lounge area comp tea and coffee on arrival prosecco and canap s foc in the eveningno negative if you want the real english experience it doesn t get much better than this it s comfy cosy homey clean adorable and staff are so nice as if you entered someone s home but better breakfast a shambles slow service had to wait ages for just a continental and then didn t have what we ordered much better to order breakfast in your room very nice room comfortable quiet with attractive decor near to many restaurants no newspaper delivered as promised no in room tea coffee making facilities got the impression they wanted to squeeze every last penny out of you pleasant decor helpful friendly staff convenient location to gloucester road tube station   min walkno negative super comfy bed breakfast delivered to the room coffee and tea on arrival free prosecco and canap s in evening wonderful friendly staff stately building full of character fitted out in period style great location between museums and lots of local restaurants and cafes you don t get everything that was advertised on the website even though it is stated you do the staff seemed like they didn t want to help and everything was to much trouble for them hotel is desperately in need of a make over good location easily reached from the tube station very little to dislike apart from not being able to find bbc   on the tv great location just   mins easy stroll to tube station and then   mins to the centre also situated on a quiet street no tea and coffee making facilities in the room only drinks available to buy from the mini bar lovely hotel and helpful staff bed was large and comfy location excellent room was big and well decorated room a little tired with a strange piece of furniture under the window that is completely superfluous lovely comfy bed really helpful friendly staff aircondition and fan in the bathroom didn t work beautiful little hotel in victorian architecture style tasty breakfast friendly service free umbrellas for rainy days the original room was sold as a superior double with a queen sized bed the room we were given was small with a standard double bed we complained and after a bit of arguing were given an upgrade with two singles pushed together the room had no tea or coffee making facilities and no hairdryer both rooms were in need of refreshing location was very handy for the tube and local restaurants the manager changed our room to a larger executive double from the superior double when we complained about the bed size and grubby room standard liked the free glass of prosecco in the evening continental breakfast so tea toast and ajm at     was overpriced car sservice could have been more helpful and not unexpectedly add   pounds for the luggage for a trip to the airport when guests will obviously have luggage beds were extremely comfortable room was charming overall no negative staff very friendly room well appointed beautifully decorated and spacious the evening drink and canopy were appreciated as was the cup of tea on arrival the only thing that was not easy for us was the breakfast you have to choose at night what you want for breakfast in the morning and at what time quarter by quarter so we didn t have breakfast at the hotel but there are many caf around the hotel if you are able to plan your wake up then it will not be an issue very close to the train station gloucester nice place to stay piccadilly line direct to saint pancras and the center of london clean safe and quiet area you feel in the hotel like at home many nice touches like tea when you check in cakes for tea time there were no slippers even though the website says they provide slippers they still said no after i called the concierge to request some bathrobes were very stiff and not comfortable with some stains there was a dirty sock left behind the night stand breakfast was a ripoff continental breakfast very inadequate bed was very comfortable no lift on one side of the hotel the side of the hotel my room was in and i was on the top floor breakfast had to be preordered the night before as no where to eat breakfast very pleasant and professional staff the room has a bit too hot it would have been lovely to have a kettle and some the in the room it was a super hotel very good value for money we got an upgrade there were no tea making facilities in the room which for a   hotel is not good wardrobe space was also inadequate for   persons the room and location was fine was upgraded to the penthouse nothing to dislike here bed was incredibly comfortable staff were wonderful they serve champagne and canapes at  pm unfortunately we weren t around for that but they did have nibbles looked like afternoon tea goodies left out in the lobby during the day yum the room could have done with updating and having a bit of a refresh the blinds on the windows and the carpet could have done with a good clean the grout in the bathroom could have been redone there are no tea making facilities in the bedroom and the breakfast is pricey if not included in the cost of the stay overall the stay was pleasant the staff were friendly the communal areas were nice and the bed was comfortable there is a prosecco hour for residents highlight of the stay it s a good location in a quiet area it s a few minutes away in a car from the royal albert hall and only a few minutes walk from the london underground that the door to the room couldn t be locked from the inside the beautifully decorated bedrooms and the lovely ensuite bath great size room for london standards our breakfast was always missing something fork milk etc and could be a bit more generous with the bread croissants etc hotel could do with a bit of a makeover the friendly and attentive staff housekeeping the first day there were two wash clothes the second day one then none on sunday there was no housekeeping whatsoever never any soap personally i don t like to wash my hands with bubble bath or shampoo security there was no interior lock on the bedroom door much less a deadbolt or even a sliding type reception is situated so that they do not see everyone coming in and going upstairs hospitality i asked to change rooms and was told that i would have to pay an additional   pounds a night i had paid in advance at   pounds night booking com and hotels tonight were offering rooms at about   pounds night   for the same dates rooms were available and at lower cost and they wanted me to pay more there was a burn in the curtain and threadbare carpet patches in the tiny room and even smaller bathroom something is amiss here maybe hiring off the books untrained immigrant staff maybe milking the property to pay debts the location is convenient for my purpose for my children live a block away i have stayed here a number of times and what disappoints me is each time i have to complete all my details each time there should be capture of my details and at least a level of acknowledgement of my loyalty i love the homely and friendly feeling of the hotel and in particular the location if your room is on the right hand side you have to take the lift in the left side and go up a flight of stairs across a landing and then down a flight of stairs to get to your room not good with suitcases good decor the mobile air conditioner was out of order for   nights out of my stay of   nights under the   degree celsius knowing that the staff had tried to repair it everyday after i reported to the front desk however it was still the same only the fan was worked the bed is comfy staff is polite for the price they should include breakfast the internet was down for   hours and was a big problem for us from the us no elevator on one side so for heavy bags this was very difficult very clean lovely inside and out nice safe neighborhood only problem with this visit was the broken air conditioning in room which was on top floor and very hot a noisy large and cumbersome portable machine had to be put in room which made sleep difficult always welcoming a favourite hotel in london willing friendly staff and lovely rooms they never sort their air conditioning out and do not appear to make it clear that it s still not working when booking ive been there summer and winter but it has not been working for some time unless i m mistaken no positive has happened to us before and now again booking com reservation means hotel will allocate less attractive rooms to you we reserved a junior suite but ended up in a lg room patio but no views bit damp old and worn beds noice from other rooms and upstairs worn furniture and floor carpet felt almost as staying in someones home no breakfast room you need to have breakfast in your room the only two things that would be possible negatives is that there were a few walls and areas that were a little worn but this also added to the charm of the place and we couldn t rent movies at night for the kids to watch before they went to bed but we had our laptops so we rented a movie on netflix it was a charming hotel that felt like we were living in london not staying at some big hotel the location was convenient and not on a busy street i used to live a block away when i was in grad school and was very familiar with the area i have stayed at the four seasons dorchester and several other five star properties in london which are nice and have all the conveniences that the cranley doesn t have spa exercise facility restaurant etc but if you are looking for more of a boutique hotel you can t go wrong with the cranley we were there four nine nights with our two kids   and   and had two four poster bedrooms which we all loved even my kids said it was great the refusal of the hotel management to rebook postpone to a later date even with several days notice a room that could not be used because the guest was ill the quiet the efficient and friendly staff who offered tea stored luggage found an adapter plug tried all they could to deal with a booking muddle the bowl of apples and jugs of cool water in the parlour lovely to look at and welcome after traveling elevator only goes to  rd floor no luggage to room service on arrival shower head was old and splashed a bit breakfast was a bit small great bed toiletries comfortable cozy friendly staff room decor was quaint lovely neighborhood was really nice they tried to charge me upon arrival despite having already paid online the receptionist argued with me about it before bothering to check and then gave me a dirty look when i saw her the next day the fan in the bathroom didn t work and there was a dirty mark on the curtains the room was very nice the location was good walking distance from the tube and museums basement room is totally affected by the smells of the surroundings ktichens and services located in the building great atmoshpere and location average staff breakfast was just breads and there s no dining room or breakfast room you eat in the lobby the beds had dreadful plastic mattress covers so hot and sweaty really bad internet connection long walk to the underground lovely decoration quiet a little restricted with eating breakfast in the lobby or your room suggestion that breakfast served in rooms comes on a bed tray with legs just to make it more comfortable plus no tea or coffee making facilities in the room that s quite limiting when you re only provided with one bottle of water each beverages could be ordered but     each is a bit steep when other hotels offer it as part of the service when laid in the bath room   you can see the underside of the sink which hadn t been finished off decoratively takes the sheen off when you can see plaster daubed on none of these things affected our stay it s just the little detail to attention that would have made a good hotel great the area surroundings were great lots of good places to visit and eat staff were knowledgeable and friendly bed was comfortable great shower i dislike that we have to pay   for electric adaptor you have to buy them not only use the roomservice was very upsetting and not kind the shower was broken and very awful to take a shower with a violent jet of water impsssible to switch off the warming we slept wuth the opened window very charming hotel with wonderful position the japanese italian girl at the reception was very helpful and nice a breakfast room would be lovely rather than in room dining and off knees in reception area so if possible lovely staff lovely room great location in our room   there were stains on the carpet and the curtain was stained and ripped it felt a little tired but nothing a bit of paint and stain removal curtain mending couldn t solve small cosy hotel with friendly staff and great location delicious breakfast in our room and grateful for late checkout time of  pm we have stayed here twice a year for the past five years and find that the rooms are starting to look very tired we were in a  th floor room this past visit and the room was unbearable hot and stuffy despite having the window open and the heating turned off otherwise staff are charming and helpful as always and location is perfect no positive location was a bit far from most tourist attractions i m a walker but for many people you would need a cab ride or underground transport staff most helpful and accommodating comfortable bed and charming room wonderful english breakfast we didn t like that the airconditioner wasn t working and because of that the room was very hot staff organised a different room for us we loved the hotel at this great location in kensington the staff was very helpful and friendly beautiful room and good bed nothing really maybe a little refurbishment will be necessary in the near future but keep the decor traditional in keeping with the building the very comfortable bed with lovely bed linen light airy room and small but nice bathroom i had a ceasar salad for lunch sitting outside which was very pleasant no mirror to use with hairdryer not allowed in bathroom guesswork staff passive at best rude at worse gbp  pre authorisation for a two night stay ridiculous requests slow to be met bathroom floor unclean not worth the price location and decorno negative everything was excellent especially our lovely room we have been a few times over the past six months and the staff is welcoming friendly and very considerate the location is a family one with a great neighborhood feeling the hotel does not have a dining room for breakfast so you had to order a breakfast to your room this also meant that no buffet was available this is totally unacceptable no positiveno negative the moment i step into this hotel i receive such a warm welcome and you are really made feel special every member of staff in this hotel is trained courteous and just so professional some creaky floorboards in my room and the one above good unobtrusive service check in could have been better i was asked for information which they ought to have had from my online booking we had no aircon in the penthouse suite and were given mobile units which were very noisy and did not get the temperture down staff are great and can t do enough to help there was a portable a c unit in our room which stopped working unless i emptied the water from it i probably shouldn t have to do this on vacation but i guess that s part of the charm of an older building i like the cranley so much i liked my visit anyway no positive the breakfast wasn t included in the offer i would have paid the package accommodation and breakfast the british atmosphere of the hotelno negative staff are very friendly and helpful they and the atmosphere will make you feel at home clean comfortable bed i m definitely going back staff weren t super enjoyable somewhat rude and not very helpful would not recommend this as a place to stay for those under   no positive can t think of anything every time i stay the welcome is equally warm a delightful small hotel which ticks all the boxes for me there was no kettle or hair dryer in the room i was promptly provided a hair dryer though when i asked very nice hotel in an excellent locationno negative free happy hour with proseco very well situated in central london the personnel was very attentive and very nice to usno negative kind and helpful staff and beautiful room made us feel welcome really enjoyed our stay like the furnishings cozy and warm rickety old loud street noise creaky floorboards like living in a big house full of kids and air con not working most staff very friendly nothing the staff were extremely pleasant and efficient the d cor of the hotel was dark which really should not have worked but in reality the effect was fabulous room was compact but comfortable we were disappointed with lack of drinking cups to make hot drinks no milk and sugar provided and paper cups not replaced im sure for the price we paid they could have provided all these the staff at reception were very friendly and accomodating the location is excellent close to metro shops restaurants mcdonalds and walking distance to arche de triomphe honestly we were happy with everything i like that the hotel was in an old building that had been fully renovated to a modern style we were unexpectedly upgraded to a suite that was more than roomy and was tastefully decorated i particulary liked the large tub with push button shower the location was very good walking distance to lots of attractions but on a quiet side street hotel employees were very friendly i would definitely stay here again no negative excellent location and easy to get to from the airport tram stops only a   minute walk away and located   minute walk away from the arc de triomphe and champs elysees very close to a little supermarket and nice bakeries as well as a couple of bars as a nice pit stop on the way back the room is lovely and the coffee is a nice little extra we really would not change a thing we definitely plan to return to paris and will stay at this lovely hotel the staff was lovely very friendly and accommodating it was very clean and we liked the locationno negative loved this little hotel in the back streets cosy and very clean close to transport and lots of places to eat bed was so comfy the staff were extra friendly the complimentary coffee in the lounge area was fantastic i would stay again no negative the overall experience of staying at the hotel and the courteous staff team lovely breakfast rooms staff and hotel juliette and jeff were particularly nice staff and we even got the story of history of the hotel the famous le relais de venice is just beside the hotel and is a worthwhile experience nothing everything was just as we could have wished the welcome was warm and the staff were friendly without being too familiar nothing was too much trouble the hotel is stylish and comfortable particularly the beds and the breakfast delicious we were also delighted to discover that it is within easy walking distance of the museum louis vuitton foundation where we had booked a visit without realising its proximity overall a hotel we would return to again and again it was perfect will definitely stay there again friendly and helpful staff great room brand new very clean and comfortable silent area good and cosy bar close to public transport a bit small for business travel if you need more facilities for meetings but perfect for couples that look for a not crowded hotel with personal service hotel is very cozzy accessible to metro sorrounded by restoraunts nothing really but a a little wider breakfast option would be nice the room was comfortable and well presented the staff were very helpful and jeff s help and company was much appreciated we waited a long time for the breakfast baguettes but the rest of the buffet was superb we loved the friendly hotel staff especially jeff who made an extra effort to ensure we had a nice stay pillows were big and i m used to light feather pillows so my sleep could have been better well something else i thought was a bit creepy is that the hotel couple years ago used to be a brothel who knows what happened in that same spot you re sleeping in lol rooms were modern and newly renovated nothing everything was exceptional the staff were helpful friendly and ensured we felt welcome the room was clean and comfortable and modern deserves more then   stars no negative if i could bring some thing back home from paris it would be the extra comfy bed hotel was   min walk to metro and   min to congress centre the staff were very helpful and friendly new elegant and clean rooms a bit small but well utilizedno negative every member of staff was incredibly friendly and helpful for a new hotel i was most impressed eapecially in paris i have already recommended this property to my work colleagues and friendsno negative this hotel is perfect it s near by the bus stop and underground station the room is beautiful and confortably the hotel clerks were very friendly next time when i go to paris i would love to live this hotel again no negative staff jules is very nice friendly and proactive location is good   minutes walk to metro with couple bakery mini markets around bed is comfortable shower room is spacious and the good qualities of toiletteries beds were not seperated in twin room and there is no bathroom door locks almost everything stuff communication clean rand comfort beds amazing decor and big tv nothing just want to thank geoff at reception who was amazing and went above and beyond for me and my partner hes a gem to their team no negative everything was perfect from the hotel staff super helping and kind to the breakfast delicious the room was insanely comfortable and clean we ordered double bed but there were two separate beds put together and the gap between beds was getting bigger very uncomfortable clean hotels in london are extremely expensive compared to other places i have visited nadler is no different and i know this is not their fault but i would go back to london more often if it wasn t for the costno positive air condition needed maintenance and after it was fine you can t open the windows most room have no views and some of them a little dark second stay at the nadler soho and still find it to be a fine hotel with excellent staff one of the best i ve met in london rooms are small simple yet fine and quiet bed comfortable shower is great and the small kitchen is a nice addition and usually i am not a fan of this feature you get a nearby gym pool access which are very nice all in all a hidden gem if you understand that it s the location and a very good night sleep that you are getting i intend to stay againno negative the design of the room was simply stunning it was cozy and comfortable i really enjoyed the layout of the room as well as the atmosphere what was most impressive was the customised function accessible from the television it really helped with the ambience i didn t like that there was no restaurant or bar in the premises i hadn t realised this when i booked and it seemed like a very strange thing especially as there wasn t really facility in the room to eat breakfast for example did mean that we checked out early not ideal for a     per night stay no positive i would have appreciated someone walking towards the main entrance to welcome me and help with my luggage i am a very demanding traveler with high standards despite the central location in soho the hotel was in a quiet street walking distance to selfridges piccadilly and oxford street i categorize this hotel as a boutique serviced residence i liked the clean modern and minimalist style of the hotel and the spacious room bed was super comfy and bathroom was modern clean and spacious too some coffee and tea was complementary though they could as a standard provide     bottles of plain water i had to ask at the reception breakfast is available on demand they provide a menu from le pain au cotidien to choose from and deliver it to your room at the requested time worked like a charm and i love pain au cotidien this is a well deserved   star hotel in my opinion   stars can only be given to establishments like the four seasons shangri la le connaught where you are literally treated like royalty the toilet bowl seat wasn t clean when we got our room room wasn t ready till    pm even though we requested an earlier check in if possible and did let them know via a booking com message upon booking that we will be checking out at  am comfy bed great location lots of good restaurants nearby we couldn t get our room dark enough even with the shutters all closed the rooms were very attractive with contemporary furnishings the kitchenette was a bonus it would be useful on a longer stay the front desk staff was friendly and helpful the wifi worked quite well we were able to walk to the british museum theaters and the underground it was easy to get around the neighborhood had many excellent restaurants and pubs soft mattress a great place very attentive staff very clean   minor issues room a bit small for   but at such location every sqmt costs and mattress a bit soft for my liking but comfortable nonetheless nothing it was very good the nadler soho hotel is very well located in the heart of soho close to bars restaurants shops and all there is to do and see in london the staff is amazingly nice and helpful     the rooms are very convenient not too big but very well adjusted to their size kitchen hidden in the closet for example the amenities are excellent i would highly recommend this hotel for a couple and or friends business trip it is a boutique hotel close to anything you may need in the heart of london staff were ignorant hotel facilities were poor overall very underwhelming for the money the location was excellent rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable the in room iron is cheap and i scorched my pants using it very friendly staff and fantastic location restaurants bars and shopping were all walking distance away four different tube stations nearby made it really convenient to base out of for sightseeing the room was very small and it was on the ground floor when i opened the shutters in the morning there s a bike parked outside my window while the other had someone making themselves at home on the pavement with people walking by all day and if you re unsure of how good the reflective glass is you feel trapped which i did good location nice helpful staff anda refreshingly unfussy approach to running things the housekeeping services were less than thorough there is no restaurant or bar in the hotel which they pitch as a concept as if it were deliberate some of the staff were a little less than helpful super location although on a sketchy block right next door to a gentlemens club two block walk to oxford street shopping great restaurants and pubs everywhere our room was small but well designed and the beds were comfortable many of the staff were exceptionally helpful with our questions no negative great small hotel room was very nicely designed great water pressure small kitchen just what we needed when traveling with a teenager if you are looking for a full services hotel with room service gyms business center this is not the place if your looking for a cool small hotel in the heart of soho this is a great choice breakfast selection was difficult for me so i didn t order the night before but i was told after the event that if i had special requirement to let them know before i stayed again and they could try and accommodate the stay was great though staff room and location and i would stay again with no problem the room and decor very comfortable bed no negative staff was extremely helpful the accommodations were excellent and the location could not have been better for walking to most sights and taking the subway to others the sofa bed was not the most comfy bed i have slept on accommodation was comfortable and staff were attentive the central location is great within walking distance of many attractions given its central location the hotel is remarkably quiet i wish there had been a bath instead of a shower the staff were exceptional we had quite stressful journey and booked the wrong dates too on top of that however the hotel staff went above and beyond they were so helpful professional and welcoming i would stay there again in a heartbeat also loved there is a microwave in the room with a tucked away kitchen unit so you could make your own meals which is great it was neat comfortable and exceeded our expectations the talixo mozio taxi that i prepaid via booking com as a taxi partner to take my family from the airport to the hotel was a no show they claim they were there but they did seem to have a problem with time differences between london and berlin whatever their problem they were not there when we arrived as scheduled prebooked and prepaid after prolonged phone calls and emails an hour and half delay and no remedy offered i had to hire another taxi for the trip and paid twice approx aud  prepaid then aud  ie   for the journey from the airport to the hotel this is not the hotels fault and i am sorry i am including this debacle in association with their good review they suggested that in future i contact them directly to arrange transport the next time i stay as our friends successfully did although i selected the taxi prebooking from a list provided by booking com as the hotel s booking partners the hotel said this was not who they use just a booking com list i suggest you avoid booking a taxi with talixo mozio which are actually based in berlin talixo and the us mozio this i only discovered when it became necessary to phone them when no taxi was waiting one appears to be the booking agent for the other so each blames the other and leaves you in the lurch and out of pocket the room ensuite and concealed kitchenette were compact but very well appointed attractive and comfortable electrical adaptors iron nespresso style coffee machine teapot kettle and microwave were provided in addition to the usual fridge the ensuite had both a rain shower and hand shower adequate shelving and a good light over the mirror the wardrobe had useful shelving as well as hanging space the staff were excellent welcoming helpful and friendly the extra bed was a put you up bed i was expecting a full sized single bed as the room was for three adults the management offered me a bigger room at no extra charge we requested a quiet room which it was until early hours when revellers woke us all up welcome screen in room staff attentive and welcoming on arrival hotel central to all amenities facilities within room excellent my only issue was that the rooms were a bit small but that s not unusual for london i d rather have a smaller room in a great location then a big room in a bad one a small boutique hotel in an excellent location for pub crawls and taking in the sites the staff was superb no negative over the past few years i have stayed at the nadler soho a number of times the walls carpets bedding and linens continue to be as clean and fresh as they were when the hotel first opened the friendly helpful staff always provides a very high level of customer service i consider the nadler soho my west end home pillows quite hard seeing as you ask about the bed lack of facilities is almost laughable particularly when staff suggested that this was because they wanted to interact with local businesses whilst simultaneously telling us that they had breakfast arrangements in place for clients with a pain quotidien which was an   minute walk away location second to none in quiet cul de sac yet close to buzzing area of soho mattress in bed was not flat so one side of mattress was not comfortable at all room is very hot so ac is mandatory as you cant open the windows but am not a big fan of ac so i was hot in the room champagne problems to be honest amazing location in the heart of soho but still quiet hotel rooms were very clean very small but very nicely done mini kitchen with fridge and nespresso machine bathroom was superb room was spotless as well as entire hotel staff discreet but helpful if needed the view from the room but hey who sits and looks out of a room window excellent location and great value for money for the standard of room right in the center of soho everything you needed for whatever type of break you are looking for staff really friendly and helpful nothing was a problem nice clean rooms would definitely stay again we booked a family room for   people and specifically choose it to have   normal beds we ended up with sofa beds which where very uncomfortable and ended up with the kids in one bed i mentioned it straight away but they were unable to change it no positive would have been great to have been able to order breakfast earlier rooms are clean comfortable and well equipped staff are friendly and helpful hotel is very well located nothing modern rooms large bathroom you can make your own breakfast lunch or dinner if you want very central several restaurants and good shopping very nearly the personal is nice and helpful it dosent matter what your guestion is they answer and be so helpful i can recomend this quiet hotel susanne richter sweden the room is very very small it was hard and not fittin for   friends and that is although we didn t booked to cheapest room in the hotel great location very clean room quite small for the price front desk receptionist brusque indifferent in the am extremely limited in room breakfast options room well equipped immaculate quiet wonderful location service reception overall cordial and professional the pull out sofa bed was not the most comfortable but acceptable would be perfect for kids however the main super king size bed was lovely so just something to be aware of if more than   adults staying in a room very friendly staff lovely clean hotel and rooms sink microwave and fridge in all rooms we stayed in we had four rooms central location for soho covent garden china town etc would definitely stay again the size of the room besides that excellent property everything was excellent from the staff to the cleanliness to the service the design the location seriously everything except the size of the rooms wayyyy too small depends on what you expect i guess i can t say i have anything bad to say about this property loved it too much i loved the service at this boutique modern hotel the style and ambiance they create for their guests not only in the lobby but in the rooms are outstanding i stayed at this hotel for   nights in march   i even booked a day trip for a tour through the front desk team which i liked i enjoyed being treated well with a bottle of wine on ice in my room and the smart tv that was personalized with my name on it welcoming me to the hotel the interface of the smart tv was very easy to use and navigate through including a welcome letter for me on the screen explaining all about the property and wifi password they even had a handwritten card welcoming me to the hotel sitting at the desk in my room the bathroom had the amenities and extras i used and enjoyed throughout my stay the kitchenette was lovely i loved making a cup of nespresso every morning and because there was a tesco right next door i would often keep a few drinks or snacks in the fridge as well due to my long stay every morning i set out to leave the hotel or when i returned the staff would wish me a great day out and then welcome me back at night i slept like a baby in a very quiet room on the second floor even though the hotel is located in the middle of a very busy soho spot this is what i loved you could be out having fun at a pub one minute with hundreds of others making noises throughout the evening and next minute i would be in solitude in my room i have stayed at other   star hotels and am surprised this place is only a   star i have to say i enjoyed nadler soho more than the   star i stayed at last time while in london which i won t mention here i definitely recommend this hotel to any young and old person who enjoys staying in the center of a bustling international city which is no more than   to   minute walk to mayfair oxford st shopping regent street trafalgar square stage shows british museum and so much more not having a bar or restaurant and being below ground level we could here people walking about probably from the reception the staff were excellent very helpful and the room was great apart from being below the groundfloorno negative perfect location   mins walk from station   min to oxfords street   min to top ranking breakfast club sweet staff arrive the hotel in rainy days staff offered tea which is quite sweet nice recommendations on tour and shopping cozy room the room i selected is not big but cozy and modern wine as welcome gift is quite nice noise overnight of the air conditioning the size and spaciousness of the room it allowed for a third bed and still was roomy the comfort of the beds and pillows the wonderful kitchenette cupboard ingenious the staff were so friendly and helpful no negative the quietness of our room only the odd happy shout after midnight which was not bad as the hotel is in soho we also liked the convenience of the kitchenette which was nicely tucked away when not in use last but not least the friendliness of the staff nothing was too much trouble they are a credit to your company no bath in the bathroom essential for a soak after a hard day walking round the capital city a bit pricey bearing in mind there are no onsite dining facilities although plenty to hand locally contemporary feel of the hotel and the service staff were excellent especially francesco we didn t get the beds we asked for the spare bed was shockingly uncomfortable there was no bar cafe the price did not reflect what we got and felt that the only real selling point is the location the room was a good size it was very clean the bathroom was a good size the shower and towel rail were cold i could get no hot water to shower or to warm the towel or bathroom more uht milk might have been useful the aesthetics and atmosphere were excellent the wifi in the room is sometimes poor nadler deluxe room has way enough space for   person additional beds were confortable too amazing location touristic shopping bathroom is equipped with a bath there is a coffee machine in the room d very quiet room stylish modern hotel i would have liked to have had a gym and a restaurant onsite the rooms are nice and new but are very small the location is excellent and the staff is very friendly the rooms are new as well room was a bit dark patio was a little strange looked a bit like a sauna room a little small for   adults better for family room staff very helpful and professional very clean and modern decor and bathroom pristine location is great except after hours it gets a bit shady singles are very small but economical to get you in the heart of soho staff was great and it was clean and convenient tv access to the internet was useful but clunky and slow shower and bathroom excellent kitchenette in a cupboard with filtered water and coffee machine was brilliant nothing room was a little on small side but the good sized bathroom with double shower made up for it everything was high quality and it all worked loved having kitchenette with coffee machine location just off oxford street liked the whole concept and i will be returning window soundproofing could be better wifi signal strength was so so room quality and cleanliness are very high for this price point front desk staff providr exceptional service n a everything was great the reception staff were helpful and pleasant the room was luxurious and spotless and although your right in soho no unpleasant noise fantastic stay a bit expensive though well worth it the location is awesome which is pretty close to oxford circus british museum soho and the underground station the staffs were friendly and welcoming the room is small but cosy which is beyond my expectation the deluxe double is not suitable for   adults as the extra beds are children size and you can barely move one bed would have blocked the door and entrance to the bathroom ensure you choose a larger room location brilliant staff friendly clean and smart literally everything was excellent the staff were absolutely lovely and welcoming the hotel was in the heart of soho where you can find literally whatever you re looking for clean amd safe hotel prefer not to have blinds that refuse to drop completely when conference taking place opposite no need for bars and restaurants so pared back hotel with extras including kitchenette and fridge an excellent idea room small neat compact everything we needed including the ironing board thank you for kettle choice of cups and mugs and coffee machine there is no gym at the hotel they have passes for a near by gym however it was very cold january and it was a hassle to walk to the gym prime location efficient and friendly staff very nice and comfortable room staff not very frienfly this was my third time in the hotel just because of the location still the staff wasn t very friendly rather stiff a hotel without food facilities can be very inconvenient location design room too small no room for cases breakfast should be included for price of room more ambient space in lobby comfy bed and facilities within the room no restaurant and the rooms are fairly small the location was excellent and the standard of cleanliness great lots of lovely miniatures in the bathroom too the neighborhood is on the edge of trendy and seedy so be prepared for people sleeping on the street late at night behind and beside the hotel and lots of late night revelers this didn t bother us though nice newly done rooms with thoughtful amenities including a super closet kitchen with sleek design and nespresso machine hdmi cable to watch netflix on tv was another thoughtful touch excellent front desk staff especially lili good location for exploring shops and restaurants and walking to palace theater and oxford street shopping not super near the tube though we had a nice quiet room with room darkening window coverings which made for good sleeping the complementary ghd hairdryer and loan of the hair straightener was fabulous too ghd store is a neighbor no negative this hotel was a fabulous find for us very modern and new luxurious bedding the bed was massive and really comfortable and super quiet it was hard to believe we were in the centre of london literally a   minute walk from oxford street the hotel staff were aldo great our room was really generous in size with a large bathroom there was also a kitchenette a sink microwave kettle coffee machine and mini fridge tucked into a cupboard brilliant we ll be back no negative the staff was amazing always had a smile on their faces and helped us with anything and everything we needed the location is so good and right in the middle of everything it was so easy to navigate to other parts of the city from this location i would definitely stay here again i have always wanted to hear those words we are going to upgrade you been waiting a lifetime great location quiet room lovely breakfast and a decent hair dryer small room but perfectly formed we loved it it was a very cold night but the room was very hot and this made sleeping difficult the room was very well designed to ensure that there were as many facilities that a tourist might need it was very well lit and there was an excellent shower room and toilet i liked the idea of a small kitchenette where simple meals could be prepared and that there was good provision of crockery and cutlery need improvements in housekeeping doona pulled up but bed not made found a used tissue from previous guest forgot face towels forgot to refill tissues also beware of the towel rack i burnt my hand and needed ice for an hour showed reception the burn the next morning said they would check with maintenance be careful great location helpful friendly reception staff nothing to not like very clear description of facilities in room although i did not thoroughly research this prior to my travel due to time pressures great location and great quality all roundno negative the staff very nice and helpful extra comfort in the room full sense of security charming surroundings with lots of nice restaurants in the neighbourhood our room was lower ground floor so it missed light but the trade off was to a have a larger room so it was fine great location had more the feeling of luxury apartments than a hotel would definitely recommend for shoreter stays the family room with queen and full worked well for   adults and   under   the room was extremely small no turn down the room looked like it had been prepared in   mins no care with the bedding and the towels very poor no bottled water in the room the tv didn t work upon arrival the maintenance guy had to reboot the system no a good experience the location rooms on the ground floor are not as quiet as the ones on the upper floor experimental nasa lighting did not work and all lights went on at    am croissants are too greasy location great friendly staff cleanliness not cheap but these are the prices the location is great in the heart of the soho   min walk to all the theatre in the back of oxford street very comfortable bad small room but well equiped orgenized and dezigned also have nespresso machine in the room in total super duper it s expensive for a cosy sized room it s a high cost option the location is excellent near the tube restaurants bars theatres a great location overall no negative excellent location walking distance to almost anywhere please note that there isn t dining room in the hotel each room at least ours has a nespresso coffee machine and you can order breakfast to your room location means that it s a little noisy we could hear folks outside throughout the night also the standard room is much smaller than what you get from a more business focussed hotel perfect location in soho for bars restaurants the theatre provision of bath robes would have been good the location was excellent the room was very well designed modern and quiet the staff were very nice and extremely helpful nothing people at the reception are very friendly helpfull and they give answers to emails within a very short time rooms are clean and quiet and modern free wlan is standard coffee tea and water for free i would choose it again outside noise from what appeared to be some sort of electronic garage door that was constantly in use during the day and at certain times during the night the excellent location of the hotel with the room having a small kitchen area some night staff the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly location is perfect and the hotel very quiet an oasis in a busy soho area would recommend and stay here in the future electrical outlet in bathroom would be more convenient for hair dryer everything else was quite nice for the size of the room the price was a bit high but this area of london maybe not that much more it is an excellent location for theater and walkable dining options which was our focus for a short stay over for more than three or four days i d opt for a larger room though our room was very comfortable and very quiet i love that the kitchenette has a brita filter on the faucet room   we could hear street noises from the room even with the windows closed shut it was enough once in a while to wake me up from sleep in the center of soho area where everything is close by filter water available brita in the room so we don t have to go look for water bottles clean rooms comfortable bed enough lighting power adapters for international travelers free wifi the hotel is small with very limited facilities i wish they had a pool or something but that s fine location location and location we did save a lot of time because of the prime location it is just in the heart of soho which makes everything walking distance the lack of a restaurant and bar the brita water filter extra tea and milk was provided promptly the staff were very friendly and one member offered us her own umbrella as it was raining and all the umbrellas provided by the hotel were taken the lady at reception was a little annoying i booked through bookings com and she asked why i didn t book direct with the hotel she then decided to inform me how i could have saved a lot of money by just calling them rather annoying to know after it is bought and paid for love the location of the hotel i also love the decor nothing great central location but also quiet great rooms small but doesn t feel like it with just everything you need clean and fun to go back to after a long day of walking around dirty linen not well thought through amendeties   plugs only one working hair dryer working only in room not bathroom plugg on other side of room complicated window blindes window can not be opened and still has a draft not nice as bed is directly on window mugs are dirty on arrival location quiet overall cozy atmosphere security modernno negative the bed was amazingly comfy the coffee pods made out stay feel like that extra special touch of home very clean great location and walking distance to leicester square convent garden and lots of other places really friendly staff and did everything possible to ensure we were happy after our aircon was t working they upgraded us with no fuss and we even got a bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon really great little boutique hotel my room was on the ground floor and next to an alleyway it was very noisy until after midnight with people talking love the kitchenette and brita filtered water the rooms are very small but for the price and location it s easy to overlook the amenities are very thoughtful adapters ready for use in the room the kitchenette is very convenient and stocked with nespresso pods and tea the rooms are simple and modern central and close to everything atmosphere around the street in front of the hotel is quite old and dirty but anyway i think after all constuction units were done it will be a better place i like the way of treat from hotel staff although this hotel is small but the kindness and service from staff is excellent some might say small but i d prefer cozy bed was super comfortable amazing kitchenette in room i wasn t even expecting in a small double wonderful amenities overall amazing experience the air conditioning was a little lacking the staff were very helpful special mention goes to the duty manager lili and staff members noemi elena jose and francisco their service were very perronalized and they went out of their way to accomodate our needs and requests bravo wifi was weak to room however staff offered another room which i decided not to take up as the room i was in was great otherwise and wifi was strong in reception great location exceptional staff particular thank you to lillie and rus whom went out of their way to ensure the stay was a pleasure lot of natural light to room kitchenette in room with fridge for own food and drinks microwave sink crockery and cutlery particularly useful excellent bathroom with high shower pressure tv has a lot of channels they really took care of the little things the wifi wasn t the best in the room expect that everything was perfect the location is perfect and also the service the small kitchen in the room hot towels stand nespresso machine and ghd hair straightener facilities were poor which would have been fine if i had known in advance but   a night and no minibar i don t expect it to be included in the price but i do expect it to be available for the price ditto a hot breakfast service was amazing no negative great location in soho near tons of bars restaurants and shopping nice walk to the london eye and other attractions front desk staff was great went out of their way to help with every request we had lilly at the front desk was amazing would definitely stay here again wifi was totally useless in the room even after staff tried to fix it timed out before one could access sites had to go to reception area to use the internet we re given a small discount on our stay for the frustration this caused bathroom facilities were excellent as was the kitchenette room was small but adequate bad internet very very slow wonky tv service and phone app connectivity no way to play music in room other than through tv channels location friendly staffno negative amazing customer service and the room had all the mod cons plus all tech connectivity beautifully clean and very quiet even in the heart of soho on a friday night we would have liked the wifi to be a bit more consistent when we were there but also know that they were having difficulty for just that day i am sure by now it is just fine the staff was sure running around to try there best to fix we loved the location of this hotel it was nicely appointed with the small kitchenette and modern furnishings but the best part of the hotel was the staff they are friendly and most accommodating anything we asked for they were on the ready to provide it made our stay more enjoyable wi fi not stable and temperature regulation in the room friedliness of staff early availability of a room already at   am access to the rooms via controlled doors which gave an additional securiy room was small i hate when they show you the very smallest room sloped roof low window when you first check in location amenities in room great wifi no bar breakfast facilities although you can order from local cafe even king rm quite small not exactly cheap but understandable considering location standard perfect for oxford st shopping soho theatre district etc but also off the main st so fairly quiet classy decor v lg comfy bed room   abit disappointing that floor lamp was not working plugs at working desk was not working only got fixed on the  rd day lighting in the room could have been brighter our blinds were not a complete blackout blinds daylight still shines thru the location and lots of restaurants in this area and fairly close to oxford circus and chinatown piccadilly reasonable room size kitchenette was useful no negative the first night we stayed in room   which was quite small and the air conditioning did not function the next morning when we mentioned it at the front desk they moved us to a new upgraded room which was very nice the stuff has been very helpful and kind beds very lumpy and uncomfortable our ground floor room was very dark and the windows didn t open so it was impossible to let fresh air in friendly and accommodating staff well appointed room and large bathroom slightly bigger rooms would have been nice felt a bit claustrophobic there otherwise just a slight complaint about a misunderstanding with the staff of where we could keep our luggage while we went off outside of london for a few days otherwise all was good location was really good with lots of good restaurants and shops just at your doorstep oxford street is just a few minutes walk away rooms are small but clean reception was efficient and friendly was given free passes to the gym no negative i travelled to london with my two adult daughters the nadler was a great boutique hotel in the heart of soho the staff was extremely kind and helpful the room was small for three of us but nicely appointed we did book a small double and it was small the bed was up against the window so the person on that side had to either clamber to the bottom of the bed into a small gap or climb over their partner it was fine for a   nights stay i will book a bigger room next time room was very well equipped with a mini kitchen even a brita water filter and a nespresso machine lots of attention to detail to help make you feel comfortable but nice and unfussy too loved the big shower the room is small for its price there s not a lot of storage space especially if it is for two people you can t open the windows so you can t get fresh air in the rooms also the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar the location is very good close to all the nice restaurants in soho and fitzovia major underground stations such as oxford circus stn and tottenham court road stn major shopping streets such as regent st and oxford st soho is busy even until late at night so it is safe for travelers until late but hotel is slightly on the side street of the busy street so still is quiet in the rooms would be nice to have   chairs for   people also some supporting rail in the bath shower lovely location in a very pleasant and friendly area of soho welcoming and very helpful staff lovely comfortable beds only real advice need some down or faux down pillows the bed sheets linens towels all super comfortable the staff was simply top notch i was so impressed with the quality of comfort service not anything really but a minor point was that the room did not have earl gray tea bags the hotel was in a prime location with fantastic rooms the staff were very helpful on arrival providing us with a cup of coffee and showing us to our room pillows could be upgraded a c a bit weak kitchen very convenient good security needed room card for hall floor and elevator access really nice staff gay pride march s impact on the area was terrible noise garbage overcrowding etc service every person at the hotel was extremely helpful full marks no negative front desk staff were excellent from check in to advice support to check out no restaurant on site but room service option through local cafe bakery even better go to the bakery just down the block and eat there fabulous expanded menu could have done with more nespressos twice the amount and greater choice of breakfast some hot choices room very comfy and free champagne on arrival for our anniversary staff called shortly after we arrived at our room to check we were happy with it and that was an excellent touch liked coffee maker nespresso and that decaf was available i didn t like having to leave and come home we like to walk and so we used the central soho location to see most of central london we walked round trip to and from the globe theatre tate modern national portrait gallery buckingham palace prince of wales theatre and the national history museum we felt safe doing these walks even late in the evening never used a taxi except for going to heathrow airport the staff aru helen liliana and the others were fantastic they greeted us every day on the way out and coming back in they helped us score great tickets to book of mormon provided a detailed map with perfect guidance and gave us the best restaurant recommendations of course got the bookings with very nice tables the neighborhood really vibrates with lots of folks spilling out of the bars after work and into the evening it was great to see the activity and camaraderie and lastly even with all the action outside our room was quiet for being right in the heart of soho and london proper we slept very easily comfortably and without noisy interruption the contemporary room was exceptionally clean and neat well laid out with a small kitchen inset including sink mini frig coffee expresso maker dishes glasses flatware and importantly a wine bottle opener the bathroom was totally functional with walk in shower and enough shelf space for lots of personal stuff not just one toothbrush there was a warming rake for towels and small laundry items overall it was a great time for us we were celebrating our  th wedding anniversary with a trip through sw england and our stay at the nadler was the best way to cap it off we will book the nadler again booked in advance and i feel i paid well over the odds for the room probably a combination of booking com and bad luck room was good with nice branded mod cons the wife likes the ghd hairdryer etc great bed and tv with good coffee machine in room staff very pleasant and helpful sad there are no bar facilities or better breakfast options from the moment we arrived the reception staff could not have been more helpful the room and bathroom were immaculate the position of the hotel is wonderful our room was very quiet and had a little outside terrace excellent value for money in the theatre district very close to tottenham court road tube station nothing great location just off soho square with loads of places to explore the front of house staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the room excellent i ll definitely stay again there wasn t anything we didn t like the staff were so very friendly and accomodating when we requested ice and extra loo paper we received it promptly and with friendliness when we arrived i wasn t entirely happy with the room location possible noise issues abd size and when i discussed this with the manager he upgraded us for free to a great room with a bath and patio and larger also very quiet it really was very much appreciated by us the decor was great and very up market and stylish fantastic location no negative i have been to a lot of places but this place had the best service ever just as we arrived the blonde lady was extremely friendly and very helpful helping us with any of our concerns i generally don t care about the service but having someone so enthusiastic made my day the price is good for the quality you get bed is comfy and you get tons of preloaded videos to watch on tv we didn t have any breakfast there so can t rate it it was also very clean even in some hotels in japan you could find hairs of the cleaning lady but here not no negative great location within walking distance to most locations of interest very welcoming staff who were also informative about local eateries and directions would definitely stay again nothing i loved it the location was excellent so central in soho but so quiet inside the room was also very cosy i had a single room it just felt like such a luxury coffee machine was an extra added bonus shower sucks either arctic cold or burning hot rather sparsely decorated looked a little stark computer for printing doesn t work location is beyond excellent all my favourite london cafes are just a   min walk away beautiful fluffy robes comfy bed given that the hotel didn t have a bar restaurant or any other facilities so you are paying for just the room i expected the bedding to be of better quality the sheets themselves were lovely and crisp but the pillows felt fairly cheap and the duvet was a bit stiff it would have been good to have a mirror in the room not just the bathroom so you could dry your hair in front of it i had to guess what i was doing we stayed in a standard double which was comfortable for two the shower was lovely and the room was immaculately clean staff were exceptionally polite and attentive fantastic location excellent hairdryer ghd straighteners provided breakfast only serves until   was not to fond of location great hotel excellent staff comfortable room and wonderful bathroom staff went above and beyond to help you even after your checked out they are willing to go the extra mile the room was very hot and stuffy and the air conditioner could not cool it off the windows did not open we requested an extra fan and it helped a bit but basically we were extremely hot with no fresh air the staff were wonderful and the room was attractive and convenient tv sound was very poor staff exceptionally helpful and friendly room excellent walk in shower heavenly and the croissants brought to the room in the morning what a great idea wonderful find in soho room didn t have movie options on television bring your own hdmi cable space is snug no restaurant or bar on site pillows not very comfortable or plush very well appointed modern hotel clean comes with a kitchenette dishes teapot coffee machine microwave and fridge brita water from the sink we asked for a quiet room and were placed on ground level with windows out onto busy pedestrian thoroughfare so not quite very attentive and helpful staff tea bags were not filled up for the next day sheets were not changed for the second night there was nothing in the mini bar i guess this is the policy it didnt disturb us too much in any case bed is comfy great location and despite being in the middle of soho it was quiet the amazing steak restaurant zelman meats is right around the corner only thing we missed was better blinders on the windows so that it wasn t so bright in the morning location is prime own coffe machine in the room even on the discount rate and for london i think it was v poor value for money the tiniest of rooms for the money it was smaller than a hong kong room i wouldn t recommend for business good location and looked stylish the room was pretty small however we are talking central london here and the price was very reasonable so it s to be expected the room had everything i wanted it was clean well decorated had a mini kitchen with all the supplies you might want a nice shower clean bathroom the bed was comfy the room was quiet it had all the tech you would expect the staff were nice and helpful overall i was very happy with this hotel no negative very crispy and clean nice high quality materials in the room kitchenette was great and in general the room had everything i needed great hair dryer super powerful plush and big towels they need better lighting in the rooms the rooms andbeds were lovely and comfortably appointed and had all we could want and more the rooms were esthetically well designed however the decorative lamps gave off no light and we could barely see into our suitcases so they should fix this issue the staff at nadler were there for our every need they were charming and gracious glad we stayed here over other properties going to miss matteo and francesco and having cappuccino delivered to our door every morning no negative i was in london for a   days business trip with colleagues the location is one of the best in the city and both the rooms and the lobby is very clean nice and comfortable the hotel staff is exstremely helpful and service minded and helped us in all ways before during and after our stay to make the experience perfect highly reccommended will be back for sure some noise from the plumbing excellent location the rooms was small but very comfortable design is clean warm and inviting the staff is very courteous smiling and niceno negative was worried when i saw it was next to the tottenham court construction site but my room was   silent room felt spacious and well laid out furnishings modern and chic but not cold the room was a little hot in the night we only realised where the thermostat was in the morning so maybe the staff should point it out to guests when they arrive there were   of us staying in a twin room with an added bed and they obviously knew this but hadn t provided an extra robe or provisions for the tea coffee facilities so we had to ask it s a minor detail but it could have been avoided superb location lots of shopping eating entertainment on the door step the little kitchenette was great staff were very friendly my fridge didn t work but since i wasn t actually needing it i didn t inform the staff i m sure had i complained about it it would have been fixed instantly the location was perfect for me since most of my london plans were already located in and around soho the food places around the nadler soho are wonderful and offer a huge variety mostly the staff was extremely helpful whenever i had any questions i was offered the option to upgrade my room upon arrival and i was more than happy to accept that offer the mini kitchen is very useful and though the room was quite small the arrangement of everything made for a perfect use of space the bed was very comfortable and made for very good rest home produced breakfast would ve been good rather than sourced from a local cafe nothing else to complain about except the fact that i m telling everyone about it shhh it s our little secret great location for theatreland really helpful and welcoming staff cosy and discretely located hotel just what we needed and very convenient for the west end no negative great location splendid hotel lobby and greatly decorated rooms amazing in room breakfast and best of all wonderful friendly staff we ll be back for sure better lighting in the room it was a bit dark the bed was incredible the upgrade was lovely and the birthday champagne and chocolates were a fabulous surprise booked a classic double room but it turned out to be extremely small as soon as you open the door you hit the bed literally no space to move staff was also quite rude the place is in very good location nothing the stay was amazing the hotel had amazing service and the rooms were superb as always the location was ideal for visiting soho leicester square and oxford street great area for young professionals air con pre sets itself to tropical so unless you remember to change it when you come in it gets very hot the wet room makes a mess everywhere just a personal thing though the room was a greats size staff were very friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble the hotel is perfectly located and it made me fall in love with soho all the more other guests waking us up at night being sick in the corridor probably an isolated incident ease of check in great location very helpful staff nice room only real negative was an issue with the blinds not shutting we mentioned it to the staff the next morning and they said they would have helped if we had mentioned it on the night however it was late at night and we just wanted to sleep apart from that it was everything we expected and more we came here for valentines weekend and overall the hotel was very impressive the location was ideal with several restaurants and theaters close by it s right next to oxford street and it s just a short car journey from london euston london marylebone the staff offered to call a taxi for us from the hotel to the train station and were very polite the hotel was very well presented particularly the bathroom very good value for money considering the location room was small my partner was not keen on the bed being against the wall harder to climb out fuse the bathroom for older people the room was very clean and decor contemporary would have been nice to have complimentary soft drinks for the non coffee tea drinkers everything this hotel offers is perfect for a single nights stay to several nights your needs are catered for perfect location for exploring london within reasonable walking distance of covent garden west end oxford street london eye and houses of parliament china town great restaurants shops and bakery s nearby hotel is very secure as you need your room card to access the corridors leading to your room and also to operate the lift the rooms could be larger and the price more acessible for us with weaker currencies but the personal and friendly service the unique location and the high level of comfort have more than compensated room size and price we have loved the exceptional very personal client service rendered by the crew miguel jessica and naomi have by far exceded our expectation on professionalism and kindness they were always smiling and looking really interested on coping with our needs and desires a restaurant recommendation a tea a late check out everything very hard to find fault but although i was a repeat guest we didn t get the personal welcome touches note choccies small token for child that others had enjoyed very minor point but small touches like this can make a difference the location is great right in the thick of it really convenient with lots of dining options a few steps away but it s still remarkably peaceful when you re in your room the staff are exceptional and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you make the most of your stay immaculately clean rooms well designed great little kitchenette reliable free wifi take note   hotels of london which charge way more than the nadler and still try to fleece guests by charging for wifi we booked a small room so it was no surprise that in this very central hotel the room really was compact the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and modern the bed was very comfy with really nice quality linen and it was a nice touch to have a nespresso machine in the room in the mini kitchenette its location was brilliant nestled in a quiet street in the middle of soho we d definitely stay again no place to have breakfast in house apart from your room but many great bakeries around the corner so ok the service the bed the location will be back again standard rooms are a bit on the small sids amazing location wonderful friendly staff modern and very clean rooms and the kitchenette is a great bonus would have loved room service or a bar in fairness there are a million restaurants nearby and the front desk picked up and delivered a last minute breakfast for me in about   minutes time room was super comfy location was great in the middle of all of the soho action staff were helpful in every way coffee and filtered drinking water in the room was really nice shower was wonderful smaller room but it was ok as i traveled for business the hotel is very well looked after friendly stuff and super nice and clean beds are important for me and the quality of bed in the nadler was perfect i did not like the extemely high charge for baguettes and croissants which are bought in if you opt for breakfast i loved the style and ambiance of the hotel nothing really only a hot iron in the room but steam ones are available if you ring reception i just didn t realise until too late excellent location in heart of soho rooms were very clean and cosy little kitchenette was a nice touch bathroom and shower very nice very quiet in the rooms too slept like a log no negative great location fantastic staff especially matteo francesco and miguel who exerted every effort to be helpful and make us feel welcome excellent hospitality for a truly memorable stay will definitely return soon fire doors are a bit of pain to keep haveing to press a button or swipe a card but this is obviusly a saftey thing brought on by the local officials not the hotel beautiful staff from all over the world great little ish hotel rooms look small and was the smallest room we stayed in for our whole trip yet it was spacious enough to do what we needed and the area is full of bars comedy clubs and right near all the playhouses so you wont spend much time in there anyway very clean and comfortable i stayed in a small double and as mentioned it is fine to stay in you do have to climb over your partner to get out of bed if you are against the window but all in all that is not such a bad thing windows that don t open are not very nice it was like a travel lodge mentality to the windows and what would happen in a fire doesn t instil confidence its just wrong for the type of hotel you are aspiring to be none of the competition in the soho area would have windows that don t open it was prison like at times imho almost everythingno negative the staff were excellent very helpful and friendly also the location was spot on right near oxford street and spoilt for choice for restaurants the room was very clean and tidy also liked the little kitchen didn t like that we had to say goodbye for now friendly and very helpful staff have not seen that level of helpfulness for a long long long time thank you to all of your staff for a great weekend and to think we just found you by accident no negative best london hotel i ve stayed in the staff are so friendly and helpful comfy and stylish room with a top location to boot an excellent stay all round will definitely return no negative really great hotel in an excellent location staff was incredibly attentive great at their jobs room was quiet and very comfortable and stylish well worth the money the room was a bit on the smaller side with a touch of overcrowding felt specifically when unpacking and packing the hotel is marvelously located staff are extremely helpful and kind everything is spotless modern and is evident to have been put using utmost thought and care what is not to like the brilliant front of house ambassadors for the hotel the room facilities the lovely toiletries the equipment the superb shower i could go on and on it was brilliantno negative location as great as we could walk everywhere theatres oxford street good restaurants etc lovely helpful young staff for whom nothing was too much trouble the first room we got was very small and the bed was too small we did upgrade the day after and it was great location staff clean what ever you ask you get the best service the staff were amazing no negative the hotel was in a fantastic location the staff were wonderfully friendly attentive and helpful our room was lovely great little kitchen and all beautifully furnished highly recommended i will be returning rooms are quite small housekeeping sometimes forgets to top up the shampoo conditioner shower gel toilet paper location very central within walking distance to many shops and restaurants staff are friendly and approachable would stay again with no bar lounge or restaurant there s no heart to the place the staff are great super lovely and helpful but it just feels like a one room tiny serviced apartment block not a hotel as such it felt overpriced location is great for soho and good for covent garden no negative location was excellent the staff extremely helpful room was fab wine and chocolates in room a lovely gesture for hubbys birthday highly recommend this hotel booking com gave a price of   when i started the booking process but i ended up paying   for the first night and then   for an additional night i booked shortly afterwards this is truly outrageous and customer service of the worst kind locationno negative really lovely clean airy rooms comfortable bed lovely hot shower staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly will definitely stay again my room was directly facing another building and with heavy blinds there was very little light coming into the room slightly gloomy in the heart of soho super friendly staff no negative i really enjoyed staying in nadler hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful very good location and nice setting room i would choose this hotel for my next trip to london very small room no breakfast facilities they send out for breakfast and deliver to room rather highly priced when there is not breakfast and no room service nice interieor good kitchenette in a very small room many small restaurants near the hotel no negative the hotel is fabulous first of all location what a location at the center of the soho close to everything second the service wow what a service they were more than helpful nice and cooperative especially dirce and the tall blond guy we sure are going to return no negative all the reception staff was great but helen was a plus plus hotel does not have restaurant or bar but front desk serves complimentary coffee soft drinks water and beer they can also coordinate room service breakfast via delivery from local restaurant spacious lobby has comfortable leather couches hotel is super quiet but one short block away is the exciting soho scene with lots of fantastic restaurants chocolate shops bakeries trendy stores and bars galore no signal so i cant make a call but there is a free internet the stuff was very friendly i liked the location and im going to book at the same hotel next visitsno negative staff were very welcoming and made us feel special we were given an upgrade and shown to our room and given a personal tour of the facilities great location too i have a hard time sleeping if it s not super black out and the window blinds were not dark enough location is perfect the hotel is very well decorated with modern features staff are friendly and very acccommodating though some are very green but green with a smile so that was great bed was comfortable the room was great and we really liked the bottle of wine they gave us no negative very friendly and courteous staff at the desk who were able to assist with all my enquiries i liked the flexibility of being able to use the kitchen facility in the room thereby cutting out the necessity for expensive room service often found in other hotels fantastic central location with so many restaurants and cafes around for supper and breakfast too only negative was the cleaner entered my room twice without knocking the hotel was lovely the rooms were well appointed and the size was fine the staff were very friendly and willing to help with anything happily made transport restaurant etc suggestions it would be even better if room size could be bigger convenient location accessible by all means of transport friendly staff chic and cozy design great restaurants and theaters jazz club nearby while the hotel s soho location is great for nightlife and dining the hotel itself happens to be located on a somewhat dimly lit side street which might make some people a little nervous at night our room was comfortable and well appointed the front desk staff was very welcoming and helpful and we really appreciated the complimentary bottle of champagne and hand written note they had waiting in our room after finding out we were celebrating our wedding anniversary poor layout of room nowhere to put suitcases the staff was amazing very helpful and great suggestions for dinner lunch mary jo at the front desk was the best i can t really call it a complaint because i knew when i booked there was no in house restaurant but that would be the only thing i would suggest can be added in the future given the fantastic location you can really get anything you like to eat around so we didn t make it a problem the staff were friendly and very helpful the location is perfect everything was clean loved it no negative everything was excellent the staff were professional friendly and extremely helpful we would not hesitate to either stay there again or recommend the hotel nothinb location is perfect staff is super friendly you just name it and you will get it they are so helpful that you really feel like home worth staying in nadler whenever i will visit london my choice will be only and only nadler some night time noise but to be expected given central location ask for a quiet room on the whole everything was superb and nothing was too much trouble i felt very well looked after location great for restaurants tube and shopping was even offered a room to freshen up in after checkout before i went to airport outside area of hotel in carlisle street we found littered with rubbish and cigarette butts could be kept cleaned even though it s not hotel rubbish but overflow from corner pub i didn t like that we had to pay   while one other person only paid   for one night stay st the same time his account mistakenly given to us on checkout the very welcoming and helpful staff were quick and efficient the entry hallways lifts and rooms were odourless very fresh and clean and well equipped rooms location was fantastic will be back rest assured i meet exceed the standards of the caliber of guest i can only assume is expected by the front desk staff my last stay in london was spent at the savoy i don t prance about in trainers and message jerseys i felt less than up to snuff by one member of the front desk staff she should rest assured that if she interviewed for a position as a member of my staff she would walk away unhired location was fine very clean new and tidy kitchenette much appreciated high quality fittings furnishings and linens most of the staff friendly low key and accommodating concierge very helpful in arranging before our arrival full day professional tour no negative the beds were comfy and the room was quite splendid it had all its own little amenities such as a coffee machine and sink for making tea no negative amazing hotel very luxurious and quiet even though it is right in the heart of soho i wouldn t stay anywhere else in london again there wasn t anything not to like lovely staff and great room i loved that the rooms have a little kitchen area with drinking water no negative excellent staff very friendly the property is in an amazing location it s close to all the sights of soho but quiet nothing coffee machine was great and good size fridge staff were helpful and friendly gave us a big pile of extra tea bags when asked the queen size bed the room was very small much smaller than other london hotels we have stayed in but the staff we fantastic there re loud noise from cars in midnights therefore u will be awake if u are easy waker the location was really good very convenient no negative the hotel was in a great location there was a nice relaxed atmosphere in the hotel and the staff were very helpful the shower temperature was hard to moderate it was either too hot or too cold location was fantastic and the bed was super comfortable no windows to the outside not cheap and no bar restaurant but plenty of options nearby perfect location quiet great night s sleep no bar or restaurant gym etc just a reception and a room seems more like a motel a nice one but a motel none the lessno positive breakfast should be provided no bar restaurant in the hotel friendliness and how helpful the hotel staff are location of the hotel is excellent ground floor rooms can be a bit dark so request a room in the upper floors if you want some natural light central location great service no negative the business model of the nadler is fantastic no excess fees for food drink etc all provided at cost from nearby vendors no negative the entire staff was outstanding and very professional they knew all the local restaurants and the best way to navigate the city we wish the hotel had a hotel bar or cafe we wish they offered breakfast we liked the modern clean look of the rooms and lobby can t fault the nadler in any way location is fantastic staff and hotel were amazing anca on reception made our stay perfect no negative location was perfect for a quick overnight loved the clean simple efficient room with nespresso soho is right outside the hotel doors fun no negative all reception staff extremely polite friendly and very helpful excellent location right in the centre of soho close to theatre land and shopping no space in our room to even walk around the bed for the price we paid i don t believe it s worth it the staff can t think of anything very friendly staff the room was perfect for a short stay and the whole hotel feels very upmarket standard room was cramped with no view no gym no bar nor restaurant great location very helpful staff decent wifi and great bed no negative the staff were fantastic we were met with smiling faces and a willingness to provide an excellent service making our short stay perfect i cannot think of anything to put into this section they staff are over the top considerate of your every need the hotel is spotlessly clean no negative great location in soho close to restaurants and theatres very comfortable room with kitchen facilities staff were extremely polite and helpful no negative the rooms are furnished very nicely great bathrooms if you want to see a lot of london it is a great location awful hard foam pillows should have had at least one that was feather down so guests could have a choice clean and quiet room nice to be in no negative only a short stop this time but favourite place to stay so far defiantly telling my friends and family to stay here the first room we were put in superior was lovely and had separate shower and bath unfortunately there were noisy children running around above us and i asked to be moved the second room appeared smaller and without separate shower which was disappointing please note that the first room s shower drain i think it was   smelt terrible and we were able to detect the odour as soon as the door to the room was open and it was even worse when we went into the bathroom the drain needs changing or at least a professional clean both rooms showed wear and tear we didn t dine in the hotel as there was so much choice elsewhere however if the prices had been more competitive then i think we would have done we noticed there was a bed topper and this was really appreciated and made a difference thank you the toiletries supplied were lovely as were the slippers and bathrobes free wifi fantastic tea and coffee supplies were great too the spa and gym facilities were the reason we booked the hotel and were very good but it would have been better without children having so much access time the locality of the hotel was a bonus and near the st paul s underground and   mins walk from barts hospital which is why we were there in the first place we felt safe walking around in the evening and took a sneaky peak at st paul s from the  th floor of the hotel really great view i didn t leave my card details when i first checked in and wanted to use the mini bar i called down to reception to add my card details but couldn t get through i called     times with no reply so called room service and explained i wanted to add my card onto the room so i could use the mini bar but they couldn t help and offered to put me through i was then on hold again for   minutes without answer in the end i gave up as i didn t want to get dressed to walk down to reception for what should have been a simple task no positive given the price of the room i didn t like having to pay for a bottle of water out of the mini bar it should be complimentary room was v comfortable clean breakfast is great staff very helpful the bed was a little too firm for me could not get a comfortable night s sleep   hour cocktail bar restaurants on the property location free wi fi bathroomno negative very nice hotel and very convenient for the city it was a hot day when i arrived and the air con in my room worked happy days very quiet room nicely furnished the room was gloomy and tired the bathroom was smaller than expected i would not stay there again the reception were ok but could have been more welcoming initial room saw us on the ground floor where we d always have to keep the curtains closed because of people walking passed and an unfortunate view they kindly moved us but we found ourselves then in an internal room with no natural light no sight of the sky and again had to always close curtains anyway as there are people directly opposite room service food was good location is good and areas outside of rooms are good couldn t quite work out how to adjust the temperature of the room would have been good to have access to mini bar fridge staff were very hospitable still had access to spa facilities after checking outno negative the hotel was great we loved the location right in central london but not as busy as some areas restaurants and the river and public transport nearby we didn t have breakfast included and it was expensive so we ate out nearby the swimming pool etc were lovely and a real treat that i didn t stay longer the location of the hotel was great   min or so walk to the st paul s cathedral and lots of restaurants nearby you can visit if you plan to travel somewhere a little further away there is london underground station which is not so far takes   or so mins walk to st paul s central station from the hotel and you can begin your adventure to the destination your looking to go to rumpus room rooftop bar is another awesome lounge we visited at night just across the blackfriars bridge worth going to if you like city views at night and partying in style also it was a birthday trip i asked for a small note wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday they went the extra mile and added a cake along side with that note thanks to all staff and the hotel for making it a awesome stay ac was hot around       c degree unable to adjust lower bed room was facing the dining room only one upper floor different easily seen thru while the lights on we can watch them eating too cups mugs were not cleaned on the  st day no serious attention to guests request almost late to airport the small taxi came while we ordered a mini van nothing mostly resto cafes shops closed early because business area after office hours they are quieter i would say this hotel was more of a   hotel check in was clumsy the card was taken twice incorrectly and we even had a phone call during the day asking us to return and re do the card the whole process seemed confused and time consuming a negative first impression the rooms overlooked the breakfast atrium and other peoples rooms this felt quite strange and not something i had realised when booking one of the reasons i booked the hotel was due to the pictures of the large terrace over looking st pauls cathedral as this was a leisure visit with friends and there was nice weather planned when we checked in we found this had been hired for a private party so we never got to see this instead we chose the bar in the lounge for a pre show drink and quick bite to eat the waiter was bordering on rude and the service was lack luster food was ok to be fair and as expected in summary this hotel would be fine for a business stay and is   step above a premier inn but fell short of my expectations and the price paid great location modern clean rooms check in took too long also they would not let anyone check in early not even by an hour i had to wait in the lounge and line up all over again to obtain a keycard the bathroom needs work i could not get cold water from the sink the glass partition along the tub is too small it runs only     the length of the tub itself leaving your backside exposed the shower head is not adjustable it only sprays straight down about a foot from the wall so to get under the water you have to stand at the very front of the tub pressed closely to the wall where much of the water is being sprayed the bed linens were not very soft rooms were quiet i had a lot of privacy my cocktail in the lounge was good family room was a little cramped especially for     per night top location right next to st pauls and the tube was a   min walk staff are very professional and pool is a nice bonus especially in london room was smaller than expected bathroom was small and prone to shower flooding air conditioning was awkward to operate and noisy room was very dark quite different to expectation based on booking com photo the room rate was now significantly lower than we paid feel hard done by location nothing we didn t like beautiful   hotel and facilities friendly and professional staff who go the extra mile great view of st paul s cathedral check in time wasn t clear then on arrival atg around     we were told it was     so put luggage in storage and returned at     to be told it was     on a friday when i pointed out that we had been told     the staff denied it and the member of staff said she had definitely said     which was untrue this put the hotel in a bad light to begin the stay no positive i was bitterly disappointed as a major selling point the roof terrace there were no facilities you had to take your drinks from the ground floor to the  th floor in order to enjoy the view of st paul s in addition one of the two lifts were out of action on saturday night the experience was not value for money i entertained some friends in the evening and it was a let down the only good things were the staff were very courteous and the location served my purpose the room we had on the first night overlooked the breakfast area and with no nets we had to keep the curtain closed which made the room very dark i think for a room like this nets is a very obvious thing we were on the  nd floor so only a few feet away from bored couples looking up and basically waving the gym was excellent breakfast was good but a little chaotic and expensive as an extra the hotel was a great base to relax after a busy day touring the beds were very comfortable the rooms were clean and pleasant the surroundings calm pretty and relaxing a wonderful contrast to the city would definitely stay again i booked this night for my birthday and i had the worst birthday ever the staff did not explain anything properly so i was over charged i am allergic to cheese and my food had cheese in it even though i said remove the cheese on the website there is a lot of false advertising was not happy at all this was one of the worst birthdays i ve ever had the cleanliness warning false advertising a double bed when they push two single beds together shower forces you to stand in the plughole and still miss most of the water as the shower head is fixed and pointed at the wall wish i had taken photos videos this is not even   star nevermind   no positive everything was fantastic convenient location we arrived early in the morning after a   hour flight and were upgraded to an apartment a block away from the actual hotel this was fantastic as it allowed us to book in at   am take a shower and begin enjoying london thank you for a wonderful stay we were so happy with everything would book with you again the fact there was no parking at the hotel but where we did park we only paid     for   hours of parking was more than chuffed considering we was in central london the hotel was lush the air con doesn t work great it was the hottest day of the year and my room was a bit stuffy it was clean comfortable and modern rooms were a really good size and the staff were really friendly staff where surly and barely spoke especially in the bar area the lady who served us snacks and drinks at lunchtime was basically rude the evening bar manager was the same unwelcoming and looked like he didn t want to be there receptionists at check were pleasant and helpful no positiveno negative the breakfast was fantastic and the spa was spectacular me and my partner had a massage each and was very impressed then we spent about an hour in the spa and it was delightful this is supposed to be an upmarket restaurant but it looks like it is cutting corners the style of the interior decorations especially in the public areas is frightful the bed was comfortable the bathroom was a little tired and so we re the spa facilities the room was noisy due to music coming from somewhere in the hotel the room was comfy enough and the staff were friendly and attentive no negative my flight from japan arrived at heathrow early in the morning and i arrived at the hotel around    am the staff kindly allowed me early check in and offered me a suite room with no extra cost we also enjoyed their swimming pool and sauna the shower leaked water through the bottom of the frame we didn t complain about it because we kept forgetting about it we didn t spend a lot of time at the hotel the tiles in the bathroom look like they need a good scrubbing i love that they left treats for us the first day because it was a birthday girls trip the staff was very helpful the english breakfast was great room was a triple room and facilities supplied were for   people with exception of cups glasses supplied for   spoke to reception each day and was told would sort but on both mornings had to call room service as wasn t sorted alarm went off both nights one night due to guest smoking in non designated smoking area other set off accidently but don t know by who location was very good the air conditioning in the room could not be set below   degrees well i couldn t set it below and at the time we stayed the weather was warm and as there was no windows to open we switched the air conditioning off some people may appreciate a very warm room we can t good location convenient to transport system friendly staff excellent leisure activities nothing right next to st pauls lots of bars in hotel and within short walking distance of tube st pauls breakfast is expensive as expected but we went to cafe rouge on the corner     per person and views of st pauls would loved to have used the many facilities more but we were out most of the time as we did a walking tour in the evening from st pauls tube with london walks hidden pubs of clerkenwell fire alarm at    am was not pleasant but what can you do someone smoking in a non smoking area hotel is lovely and clean and rooms comfortable and well equipt i think you would appreciate this hotel if making use of all facilities including spa it is a shame to only use it fleetingly bed was very hard room was very nice but air con not working and fire alarm went off twice during the night over two nights waking us up on two occasions no positive staff poor service small room bathroom poor no bidet shower flooded bathroom no hand held shower poor extraction handle missing off shower control location good common facilities we were charged an extra   for an early check in when we had paid   for two rooms for   night i thought that was ridiculous especially as one of the rooms they downgraded upon returning to the hotel the security guard was rude and refused to let us in initially as each person didn t have there own room key we stated our names and room numbers and he still made us wait for   minutes not happy after that at    am reception called our room about an incident i knew nothing about and started barraging me with questions whilst i was half a sleep then they called back     minutes later and tried having another conversation with me in the middle of the night and finally to top it off the fire alarm was set off at    am causing us all to leave our room i was very very disappointed and cannot display how angry i was that evening disgusting no positive not happy with second night s stay little sleep short fire alarm at midnight loud noise in room at   am staff assisted but when we spoke to staff on telephone staff hung up on us during conversation noise started again   minutes later noise related to air conditioning which was turned off and we were provided with fan planned to leave hotel at   am management offered apologizes but nothing else to make up for bad experience left the hotel unsatisfied and tired we will not be returning to hotel clean and nice property the non smoking room smelt as if someone had been smoking in there recently the bed was very comfy and there are some good restaurants nearby so no need to eat and drink in the hotel the hotels location is also great to get out about and explore the surrounding area and the rest of london spent the day in the spa except the hammam suite was not in use there was a sign on the door of the suite saying that it was booked for a private party although we did not see anyone leave or enter the hammam suite all day nobody could withstand the heat in the suite for more than   minutes let alone all day i suspect the suite might have been broken but instead of admitting this a phoney excuse was given i suspect anyway also when in the spa a group of young male teenagers proceeded to take photos of themselves in the pool and using the facilities i found this rather uncomfortable and no member of staff seemed to approach them on why they were taking pictures in a spa i just didn t feel it was up to   star standard unfortunately however room was lovely and comfortable and the location is great for the theatre district room was lovely very stylish and bed was very comfortable i was on the fifth floor but unfortunately the view outside the window wasn t great just another building blocking my view stayed here several times staff are so welcoming upgraded me to a bigger room and surprised me with birthday cup cakes fantastic service when we tried to run a tab at the bar the requirement was that our credit card was to be taken away and kept at the cash counter according to the european laws at no time can the credit card be taken out of the sight of the customer a solution has to be found perhaps a pre authorisation without the customer having to part with the credit card location view could have been a little better looked out onto side road but could see st paul s cathedral when getting close to window cupcake left in room for my partners birthday celebration was a nice touch nice quiet room good blackout curtains and comfy bed luxurious feel the rooms are a little dark but we only stayed one night so it didn t really matter the hotel is in a great location we had a side viiew of st pauls the bed was large and comfortable the glass atrium in the centre of the hotel makes it very bright and airy should have bigger tv it was very small location is not central litle bit far from some attraction and main streets but busses and underground is just steps from the hotel staff were welcoming and smiling each time i enter the hotel hotel is nice and clean starbucks inside the hotel good size room for a   star hotel the technology in the room is really out of date the tv was tiny and they asked for a   deposit just so we could unlock the pin to use the bluetooth we only wanted to watch catch up tv on the bigger screen rather than our phone but we were told the   may take up to   weeks to return there reasoning was we could watch lots of movies and run up a big bill ridiculous and i refused to pay it on principle i ve stayed in many lesser starred hotels in london where movies are free and you can use an i pad or such like to control lights tv etc this place needs to catch up with the times very comfy bed spacious and sound proofed room sauna and pool in the bathroom two of each bathroom products would have been appreciated as it was a double room with two single beds the staff were polite and helpful the beds were very comfortable and roomy any minor inconvenience was dealt with immediately for such a superb location be prepared to pay the price not just of the room but all the extras breakfast bar room service etc fantastic location within easy walking distance of st pauls tube and very close to the millenium footbridge over the thames superb facilities modern clean customer friendly facilities staff professional friendly and willing to help excellent room with a free upgrade on check in the room was too small even we had upgraded the mirror inside the cupboard was broken and the amount of dust not clean behind and top of the tv was not cleaned for a very long time the cables behind the tv had so much covered in dust we like the location of the hotel and the front of reception staff were all friendlyno negative the room service was quick and polite the beds were incredibly comfy and the shower was amazing especially after a long flight despite arriving early i was given an early check in at no extra cost nothing the hotel and facilities were fabulous the room was spacious and beds very comfortable but the best thing was the shower amazing really helpful service from the concierge all in all fabulous stay at this hotel the only thing that was disappointing was that we ordered our full english breakfasts to the room and they were cold apart from that everything was great everything the staff the atmosphere the decoration the spa treatments are all fantastic staff were very rude for the style of the hotel i would say they need to train their staff better at customer service at check in the member of staff just walked off to do something for several minutes without a word to us just left us standing there the rooms were ok but perhaps require some updating as a little out dated great location nothing really thought breakfast was a little pricey rooms lovely and spacious and very comfy beds staff very courteous and friendly nothing was to much bother spa was beautiful and very relaxing second visit to this hotel and looking forward to returning very soon great central location the view into the atrium of the hotel and that it was limited daylight into the room variability in friendliness of staff at reception i enjoyed the gym and the spa the location was fantastic for running along the thames it was great having ground coffee in the room but it would have been better to have the option of instant coffee including decaffeinated option staff were really friendly and helpful gave us an upgrade plus breakfast when we asked at checkin whether a fridge was available in the room we were able to check in early although we hadn t booked this ahead it was a great location for city of london we had planned to visit the tower of london and greenwich both of which we could get to easily walking boat after we checked out we could leave our bags and pick up later which meant extra time for sightseeing breakfast at   pounds per head is way over the top brilliant hotel pricy but worth it tube  m away great location sky sports in your room it was our  th wedding anniversary and i had let them know so was a bit disappointed that reception did t congratulate us or that there was not a card in the room this was our  rd visit and i was disappointed that the personal touch seemed to be missing this time the view of st paul s is great from our room   the bed is large and comfortable and the room is clean fire alarm went off at    am not good after you ve just run the london marathon and want to sleep attractive contemporary hotel the health club was great as it had a good sized pool and jacuzzi the view of st pauls from the roof bar was stunning all the staff were very helpful we were asked did we want to get an apartment room but didn t realise it wasn t in the main hotel it was only a   minute walk but it wasn t as pleasant as our previous room there location and friendly staff i was travelling with a colleague on business and we arrived at the hotel at   pm local time   am for us we had booked a superior twin room and noted that when checking in we got a room with one double bed we went back to the reception and asked for a twin room we were assured that the next one is a twin room it was a double we went back to the reception and were then told that superior twin in that hotel only comes with one double bed and we need to pay extra to get an executive room with two beds alternatively one of us could sleep on the sofa bed in the room we declined and proposed to give us both of the rooms we had already been sent to regardless we were told that the hotel was fully booked we showed our booking but the staff maintained that according to their web page superior twin had just one bed when asked to show a print out of the web page it did not concur their position until then still no apologies from the staff and no real proposals for solving the situation they obviously had an executive twin available but were not offering a free upgrade so we finally proposed that they could pull the double bed apart which they finally agreed to do we got to the third room an hour later the small beds were really uncomfortable since there were no cover mattresses and we got old lumpy blankets we had a third colleague staying at the same hotel she had booked a superior double when we got to her room the next morning we realised that she had a superior twin so superior twin rooms with   beds do exist in the hotel and the staff just blatantly lied on sevaral occasions great location for a business trip but not for vacation the bed was uncomfortable when i asked for the quilt to be changed due to the first one being very thin and lumpy the sent another one the same up to the roomno positive the breakfast was cold and very over priced was not happy with it at all and had bad stomach rest of the day oh and one thing that is more of an annoyance really but there were no plug sockets by the bed so couldn t keep phone by bed which i find very annoying staff were lovely and very willing to help though so no complaints there at all and hotel itself very smart and everything looked nice but the breakfast which i was looking forward to was the biggest let down only had a tiny amount of cold cooked breakfast that was enough to put me off it really was that bad and sadly it really spoiled the stay the room was abit warm when we first arrived som the hotel was very clean and stylish the staff all very friendly and welcoming and the room we stayed in was amazing spacious and immaculate no negative very clean and elegant looked amazing from the inside and out great location and our room had a good view of st pauls cathedral spacious rooms and comfortable beds at an extremely good price compared to other upper end hotels in the city didn t get time to use the spa facilities unfortunately but would definitely recommend this hotel to others nothing we didn t like really like if i had to pick a very minor detail the route from our room via the dedicated lift to the spa pool seemed to take us through an area which seemed to be used for storage of boxes etc although this may have been just temporary so no complaints the service was excellent throughout our stay and a friendly attitude from the reception staff to the cleaner in the lift and our waiting staff in the lobby bar made it memorable the shower was a disaster style over substance the shower cubicle was small but someone had put in   different shower heads which blasted through the poor seal and flooded the floor every time we mentioned it to a member of staff as we left and he didn t seem surprised fantastic location great pool and spa area simple but good sized rooms reasonably helpful staff some warmer than others toilets nr reception v poor dirty and unprofessional for hotel of this rating great room and floor   perfect view of st paul s and away from lift blocks and noise love the sounds of the cathedral bells n a the consierge service was brilliant all staff were always happy to be of assistance even in early our of morning the spa was lovely and relaxing and good great value for money spa treatments were fabulous the breakfast should of been included at that price also asked for a room with a view however we had a view of the wall the staff were very helpful the location was ideal and the rooms where beautiful requested a nice view from room not actioned bathroom was best i have experienced at any hotel housekeeping exceptional sofa bed made up for child quickly on arrival and not charged extra for good rate for a london hotel room got a supposed upgrade from a superior deluxe room to a studio room in another building which we were not happy about then when we paid we gave   more over to the girl and she didn t count it right and didn t give us the change and when we said to her we have her more she said we didn t and that she counted it twice but we knew we gave her more room was nice the staff were very poor and i was served under cooked poached eggs it took forever to get new eggs and by that time the family had finished their breakfast so we left good location one particular member of the reception staff took very long to allocate us a room despite us having arrived earlier checked in and paid frustrating as we needed to get changed quickly and make a concert in time no positive sauna and laconium in spa facilities did not work for the money i would have expected a bit more variety choices in room tea coffee facilities did not like view from room feel exposed to atrium area the beds were comfy and staff nice and helpfulno negative fast check in out lovely room very conveniently situated i keep coming back to the grange st pauls it s my choice when staying in central london for business or seeing friends it seems quiet and relaxed as it s not in a main business or tourist spot the hotel offers a just what i need for a short stay clean comfortable room excellent breakfast and   hour bar and food all within walking of the city and a short taxi ride from the west end no negative it didn t really state that the roof top bar in the pictures were for private events only so little deceiving when you imaging sitting there drinking cocktails with the girls the booking in system the rooms don t ever seem to be ready an earlier than  pm and can be later we had theatre tickets and it meant we were tight for time facilities and location staff score would have been excellent however had evening drinks in one of the bars and had a bit of attitude from the bar tender otherwise helpful and welcoming staff perfect location for all london tourist destinations chilled vibe and had a quiet room for central london the staff could be more attentive professional and better coordinated coordinated when eight people present at the desk pay zero attention to customers busy with their things instead sonething is vlearly going wrong this is the reason why i will not stay here again the hotel is new with comfortable sound proof rooms there was a maintenance issue with our room prior to check in which meant we had to wait in the lobby for   minutes while it was sorted out the pool area is gorgeous and the roof terrace is amazingno negative we were moved into the grange hotel suites which were around the corner from the hotel this wasn t a problem for us and the weather was so nice that a brief   minute walk to the main hotel was fine to go and get breakfast they had included this free of charge because we were in the suites the bed was very hard but perhaps some people would prefer that breakfast had a good buffet selection and the location is perfect the roof terrace on the  th floor gives you a great view of st paul s and the shard being a londoner i am more than used to paying london alcohol prices in mayfair chelsea but charging   for a double hendricks gin and tonic is ludicrous and on top of that it was served in a small catering glass with very little ice we couldn t help but feel this was a complete rip off the spa was also very messy and not relaxing at all floats and hoists were left around with rolls of tissues all over the place not great for a   hotel offering spa facilities i will not be coming back to stay in the hotel or to use the spa it was a birthday surprise and the staff ensured there would be some cupcakes in the room upon our arrival no negative the hotel is in a fantastic central location near st paul s cathedral the tate modern and the millennium bridge we loved having breakfast at cafe rouge a block away great atmosphere great location and a much better value for the money than the hotel breakfast we visited london for my sisters hen do just my mum sister and myself we checked in early at  am but room wasn t ready so we ventured out and came back at  pm we then found out our room had been given away so we were offered a double bed and sofa bed room and breakfast for free this was the only room available we were shown the room and it looked dirty and there was a dirty and used coffee cup we were then shown to another room which had to be ok as only other room available apparently we won t be returning in the future the location was great and hotel was lovely it was just really disappointing how our booking got messed up the property was situated near to a tube station walkable to southbank and generally in a really lovely location it has a great balance between central but closed off and peaceful the roof terrace is very exclusive and the view of st paul s is out of this world no positive one young lady at the reception was not friendly and did not have an attitude of hospitality breakfast is just ok but not work the money you can get better breakfast elsewhere cook doing omlette and other egg dishes was bad just could not cook proerly could not control the temperature of the bath shower was ok although i used to stay in this hotel the level of service especiall level of service staff was frankly lower than before overall cleanliness and comfort of the room was fine free use of bathlobe and slippers as well spa area including swimming pool and gym facility is also clean and excellent location is superb near to queen victorica st and other center business locations our view was a brick wall towels were thin and scratchy room could have used a bit of an up date made two room service orders both were wrong location amazing and staff very friendly it always seems too expensive for what you get and not really   star standard unless you re in the rooms we can t afford we didn t book breakfast as last time was so disappointing wonderfully helpful concierge staff the decor was dated and the bath had some chips in it the starbucks franchise coffee is more expensive than the starbucks accross the churchyard room was very quiet some prices were a little high esp cocktails and be aware that key cards do not gain entry to every corridor ask for a map for the car park although it is only   mins away you find yourself going in a circle the room was spacious and light with a beautiful view of st paul s cathedral especially at night best rooms facing outer side of hotel there are several restaurants to choose from and some great eateries   mins across the street the cocktails were first class and the staff were alert and helpful at all times the attention to detail at this hotel was outstanding if you are thinking of using the pool spa or maybe a full body massage this is the spot with several chilled buddha corridors with no shortage of treatment rooms there are many treatments on offer with staff on hand to offer you beverages and snacks in the beautifully chilled reclining rooms with sofa beds and reading material galore the pool has a ham man and steam jacuzzi as well as sauna area all beautifully finished with sandstone tiles and perfectly kept this hotel is definitely worth a visit and you will come away with a real feel good factor depending on which staff you spoke to at breakfast some staff were not very good at communicating not responsive to customers needs breakfast tables had missing saucers cutlery etc this let the whole experience down but on the plus side then you got staff who were extremely helpful and went the extra mile bit too cold in the area by bar nearest the front door the environment was really nice very clean hotel impressed with the way the door man would run to the top of the road to wave down a taxi from the taxi rank round the corner atrium a fabulous space to sit and relax in and surprisingly not a cold space at all the cleaning of the room was patchy eg glasses were not replaced when cleaned floor of accessible wet room was like ice when wet the location was fabulous and the staff friendly and helpful the check in person was not very friendly and could have been a little bit more welcoming and informative convenience of the location quiet and neat and luxurious the warm welcome at the door was lovely the sink was cracked the room a little frayed round the edges comfy bed and a fabulous shower and perfect location lovely roof top sitting area nothing this hotel oozes class and modern sophistication from entering the hotel and being greeted by a totally professional polite and courteous doorman to the no messing around attitude of the reception staff the room was outstanding immaculately clean attention to detail was second to none the three way power shower was like nothing i ve seen the mini bar wasn t a rip off either a decent bottle of cold champagne didn t cost the earth my kids headed straight to the pool for my wife and me in tow constantly greeted by polite friendly and well turned out staff we had a drink in the bar reasonably priced and plush it was a nice relaxing area the breakfast was superb tasty with exceptional presentation again served by polite and efficient staff on check out i wanted to leave my case for the day no problem from start to finish we loved everything about it we hit the jackpot with this hotel now planning my next visit with my wife no running water in our room when we arrived we couldn t shower get washed or flush the toilet we left for a few hours and problem was rectified when we came back to room location was good and rooms were comfortable the steam coming out of the vents by the feet was extremely hot maybe this should be positioned else where to avoid heat burns the service was fantastic from the staff hotel the spa ajala spa facilities and amenities were were super clean lots of snacks available too the full body scrub massage treatment was bliss thank you to the therapist who made it a wonderful experience staff were disorganised and mixed up my billing which meant that i had to pay more at check out no real recognition or responsibility taken by staff location and facilities were great conceierge service was excellent i found the lights in the room were difficult to work and could not turn them so had to see by the bathroom light the staff are very helpful the bed is very comfortable and i had dinner in benihana with a friend which was excellent and an amazing experience the spa and pool is a little small with no lounge area the pool was also a bit cold so you didn t want to hang around in it and without a lounge area you can t really stay in the spa for very long it was also quite busy because of its size great quality hotel and very helpful staff nice late night bar too breakfast slightly chaotic tables very close together staff at breakfast seemed more interested in clearing tables than attending to guests needs would have been nice to be greeted at the hotel door and directed to reception which is not immediately obvious convenient location comfortable room bar and lounge staff attentive excellent continental breakfast no negative concierge very helpful when arranging car to airport loved the convenience of starbucks at the lobby great location for metro access sight seeing some dining having beers nice selection of pubs close by majority of the places cater to businesses during the day so lots of lunch options dirt dirt dirt i have never been to such a dirty hotel that is suppose to be   or   stars dirty carpets stains on pilows bedding its was ubelivable like a castle full of dirt and dust i gave up the idea of using spa and pool as i didnt want to risk the location is amazing the lobby with glass ceiling makes great impression but the dirty sofas carpets etc takes all the good vibe on the contrary the food you can order in the lobby was good when we checked in a staff member placed us in an accessible room without a bath tub or enclosed shower she did not make it clear at the time when we came back later and asked to be placed in a standard room she claimed that she told us and we were changing our minds we corrected her several times and she never admitted she was wrong no positive the room was quite dated tv was tiny and made room look shabby bed not very comfy check out time seemed quite early  am staff were quite friendly made us feel welcome bathroom was nice beds and pillows extremely uncomfortable like sleeping on concrete sore neck the next day bed linen duvet and pillows really poor quality location and st paul s right outside breakfast was good bathroom nice and clean and modern incompetent staff room was overlooking a restaurant and meant opening the curtains looked directly onto people eating breakfast   feet from window not enjoyable decor was very weird and rooms extremely dark would not return no positive totally lacking in charm or atmosphere quite dull really i would suggest that it is trading on the name alone my executive double looked out immediately to occupied glass fronted office block bed faced away from the cathedral so poor design generally drench shower over bath no wand noisey air con with minute notation for ops shall not wish to go to this hotel again no positive the bed was rock hard even with the extra mattress toppers on it i wouldn t stay there again for that reason the location was great staff helpful and pleasant reception was quite busy and staff tended to continue dealing with previous customer issues even after they had called the next customer over a small issue but it affects the overall experience additionally cleaning staff ignored me saying good morning and didn t smile again a very minor issue but one which i haven t experienced in other five star hotels great location really good value for money facilities were top class the hotel was extremely clean throughout no information telling you that you can be seen undressing in front of your bedroom window assumed it was one way glass also spa was unavailable apparently should have booked but didn t see anything when i booked online location service design of the hotel the bed dipped down in the middle and felt a bit lumpy which you would not expect for the price paid we did not like having to queue up for a lengthy period of time ca   minutes both to check in and to check out there was clearly not enough staff on the desk either time the location was superb the room was very quiet the window was facing the inside of the atrium and there was a huge neon lit advertising pillar right in front of my window i could not open my curtains very dark room there were a couple of mix ups with the room reservation and mini bar which were eventually rectified the room was nicely decorated the buffet breakfast was good the location was good on the border of the business district we were a large group attending my son s wedding at st paul s and the level of clarity help overall from the front desk staff was mixed also one of my sons was given access to the wrong room which was already occupied overall quality and location of the hotel were excellent and the concierge staff were great the bar food could ve been better especially for the money that was the only thing i did not find worth what we paid the hotel itself is gorgeous definitely worth the money the staff was very lovely and accommodating many bars and restaurants throughout the hotel our room was spacious and very very nice lots of room for my mom and i to get relax and get ready to explore the city the hotel looks like pure luxury both inside and out the breakfast was great too full english plus continental breakfast items would definitely stay again and it was in the best location you could see st paul s cathedral from the front door as it was right behind it the bathroom floor was flooded when showering overall the staff were friendly and helpful however when buying a drink after  pm the bar was very busy and the gentleman that served us was blunt and unwelcoming very comfortable bed really good view of st paul s from room really good breakfast lots of choice air con wasn t great in room the swimming pool a bit to cold to enjoy shower in room was spraying in funny directions so went in my eyes not relaxing location great easy check in and out process nice looking hotel spa lovely serious swimmers not using swimming lanes in pool and being discourteous to majority wishing to use leisure lanes room refreshments tray no longer has quality biscuits cheap costa coffee coffee biscuits which don t go nicely with english tea facilities as usual excellent minor gripe curtains were stained and needed cleaning but pretty much everything else was very good location upgrade facilities concierge service very helpful breakfast was average for the price first day tea was only offered from pre made jugs only day   did we wise up to asking for fresh pot of tea at table hot buffet was not reflective of the cost whereas the continental was very good there did not seem to be the option to order from a menu which many equiv rated hotels would family room worked well for     birthday cup cakes for the children were definitely a nice touch within easy walking distance of family friendly restaurants clean modern and well presented really nothing at all just tv not in ideal place for watching it when in bed helpful friendly staff especially the concierge and colleagues comfortable room and bed quiet so excellent night s sleep good shower and bathroom there was just a few items that caught my eye lights on the main feature light were not working bedroom light lampshade was broken light by the bathroom was damaged room   this was my second visit to the hotel very nice the view was miserable despite asking for a view we witnessed only another building and that had dustbin clearance at     am that went on for half an hour at least very noisy the beds were very comfy and perfect for the stay the leisure club was also an added bonusno negative hotel was beautiful and immaculate the staff were friendly and helpful the room was in excellent condition modern and comfortable and the bed was divine no negative quality large comfortable rooms huge bed huge range of complimentary toiletries robes slippers fully stocked mini bar reasonable room service prices great range of on site restaurants and local eateries great spa leisure facilities what s not to like hugely enjoyable stay a bit tricky to find leaving mansion house tube station went round in circles in sleet and freezing cold very comfortable beds and handy for the party i was attending the swimming pool needs more places where you can put your towels while you smim just a little thing that could be improved very comfotable relaxed atmosphere helpful staff nice music in the bright airy lounge bar serving reasonably priced bar meals lovely relaxation room in spa with little treats to eat and herbal teas in the heart of the city near bus stops and the river the room and en suite bathroom were clean and comfortable however the carpet was worn in one place and lamp shades were cracked creased which detracted from overall good impression we were visiting st paul s cathedral and covent garden so worked out very convenient for us the breakfast was very poor the hot offer was at best luke warm and what was offered was a poor selection i am astounded that you did not offer hot water and a variety of teas the tea delivered was pretty much undrinkable no positive he ipod dock is an extremely old one definitely needs to be updated as i could not plug in my iphone   also the bathroom tap was pretty difficult to figure out but the maintenance people came pretty quick to sort it out when my boyfriend and i stayed at the grange they had upgraded us to a queens double bed room which i guess was good the room was nice the bathroom was very clean and had a make mirror we order room service at like  am and the food had come within     minutes the chicken wings were the chicken wings i had had in a long time the cheesy garlic bread was also nice can t think of anything the breakfast was lovely very spacious hotel considering it s in the middle of london it takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city rooms are spacious and has everything you d need staff could have been more friendly when greeting us for breakfast we had not booked breakfast and knew this was an extra charge and totally happy to pay but we were greeted in quite an aggressive manner we were kindly upgraded to an executive room and a twin queen room which was unexpected there is a musty smell in the corridors we changed rooms once because there was also a musty smell in the first room we were in the decor is a little old the carpets it is a   star hotel but there was no cleaning service in the evening the bed was very comfy pillows perfect for me the shower fantastic with the jets was dissapoint with are room view the rooms were a good size and the bathroom was lovely the shower was great the bar food was very tasty and reasonably priced the ghastly light column in the entrance hall really detracts from the atmosphere in the cocktail bar it s far too bright and really tacky the steam sauna etc rooms in the pool area felt slightly shabby the staff were lovely the room was very comfortable and quiet the location is great with some good bars and restaurants nearby nice to have bathrobes and slippers to go down to the spa pool level would like to have had an outward facing room if i had known we overlooked the central atrium i would have requested an outer facing room just personal preference great location and a lovely   minute walk to the tate modern some decent well known restaurant chains within less than   minutes walk no negative breakfast was great i booked without but they said that they would upgrade me to a suite in a nearby associated property and give me free breakfast wish i hadn t as good as the breakfast was other property felt isolated and didn t get the vibe of the main building staff were not trained in basic communication skills no knowledge of the hotels event and food outlets opening times on nye maybe the hotelemployed temp staff for the holiday season didn t feel welcomed or we were in the hands of people that cared we were there again perhaps it was because it was very busy and the holiday season perfect location great rooms especially the studios which are abit far from main hotel but it really doesn t matter for the casual independent traveller party on same floor  th a little loud particularly guests going from bar on ground floor to roof staff were really helpful spa facilities were fantastic the prices can be lower the concierge people have been more than helpful didzik victor and istvan they helped me find a ticket to an football match above all they helped me with the documents i ve forgotten in the hotel and those documents were of vital importance to me i m more than grateful to them they are the reason your hotel will be of choice for me the next time did not like the cost staff could not have been more helpful after checkout i realised as i was leaving i had forgotten my walking stick when i told the young doorman he immediately went to retrieve it with no fuss or hesitation no negative very convenient location for my needs we were at a function at the hotel and everything was well managed check in and out easy and staff very pleasant breakfast was very busy there was a long queue and wait with my two young children st paul s cathdral is literally on your doorstop convenient location and quiet great facilities family room was a good size hotel left two cupcakes for our daughters as we were celebrating our youngest child s birthday was a lovely gesture the fire alarms in the room went off a few times on one night at  pm and no one told us what was going on another night at same sort of time lights in the room kept turning themselves on and we had a plane to catch next day so not much sleep only had   nights so our sleep was very disrupted the staff were great and so was the location as a returning guest i also recommended the hotel to friends who were delighted they had a great stay but this time i was very disappointed with my bed and the linen it did not feel smell fresh and i spoke to the manager about this certainly the pillows and mattress protector need to be replaced i hope they have done this usually i am very pleased with my room love the hotel and its position make sure you check your room prior to check in i booked a twin room and the description did not match the room i received i was given a very tiny and somewhat squashed obvious double room which had been turned into a twin room this was not well done because one bed was right under the lamp which i banged my dad on throughout the night i gave feedback but was to tired to swap rooms so was given a complimentary breakfast which wasnt a five star breakfast i much preferred the tower bridge branch this room was not value for money the location of this hotel is nice the spa gym and swim in really good staff are friendly and helpful the deco of this hotel promotes five star but the rooms don t reflect this understand the need for subdued lighting in the room but a bit to low a light or back lighting of the thermostat control is need i had to use the torch on my phone to make adjustments to the temperature superb location clean and spacious lifts can get congested and can involve a wait a lot of staff visits to room such as checking mini bar and turn down service seemed a bit excessive room comfort excellent very handy to st pauls nice ambience and generally quiet reception staff talking amongst themselves laughing joking whilst there was a long booking in que not   star service bar staff excellent helpful and friendly location cleanliness of rooms facilities room dark no natural light as internal room over looking interior of hotel room not made up for second night of my stay no towels replaced etc took a while to get served in bar on second night being ignored staff not aware who should be served next very poor service for this calibre of hotel great location nice room good value for money the shower head squirted water all over the bathroom floor which was a bit annoying but that was the only thing lovely welcome by receptionist after a long journey fabulous room and a great nights sleep rooms furniture shows it s age rooms are dirty some stuff stuck on the table and has never been cleaned dirty pillows plenty blonde long hair in room not ours hotel entrance into west wing shabby and always smells like going into public swimming pool people put their dirty room service orders back on the floor and not being cleaned up for hours hours strange people walking almost naked across floors scary service personnel didn t live up to even   star standards restaurant reserved table was given away wrong orders being brought to table pool water very cold sauna benches were soaked with water can just someone tell the guest to use towels in the sauna could continue but likely worst   star hotel we ve ever been location the bathrooms could have been a little larger and no view even in the executive suite the interior of the hotel was fantastic and nice rooms but very close to st pauls just across the road the hotel it self doesnt fit the standard of a   stars hotel staffs communication water shortage in the middle of the night for me i think the hotel is overrated its one of the worst   stars hotel i have ever stayed in despite the lower cost compare to other five stars hotels within the good location there is not much good things to say about it some of the staffs are nice and friendly but seems not profession the location was ok nearby st paul the price ok for a   stars hotell would of liked the opportunity to of used the mini bar but because my girlfriend checked in first i did not get the option the hotel was lovely inside and worth every penny we paid the rooms were nice inside bar staff in front bar not very good and rude minor point though still had a great stay rest of staff were excellent location and very helpful concierge i have no complaints the staff at the reception was very attentive and pleasant the cleaning staff was also detail minded i had a sweater which i hadn t folded before leaving the hotel in the morning yet it was folded and lay nicely on the bed when we came back there was no noise from the hallway the bedroom had a comfortable sofa and the bathroom was decent as a five star hotels i was a bit disappointed by the restrooms located next to concierge honestly disgusting of course it s a detail only when i was there the hotel unfortunately faced hot water disruptions this had had an impact on water pressure afterwards room is big enough very clean and quite charming staff very polite and always willing to able cold and distant front desk at the day of entry   pounds extra charge provision per day wasn t something i expected and didn t like the way it was explained to us the hotel gives a sense of calmness nice lobby very good wifi very friendly concierge staff spa was full of young children on the evening so we just stayed in the room great facilities but maybe a family time would be a good idea incredible view of st paul s and only  min walk from blackfriars if that easy access to all of london great hotel inside and very impressive with friendly staff very good value for money room   described as an executive double   per night had internally facing floor to ceiling window onto the atrium but literally faces onto the scenic glass elevator about   feet away which is constantly going up and down the atrium this meant that anyone in the   glass lifts has a birds eye view into the room at all times we had to shut the curtains all day room lighting is very dim so it was rather a gloomy stay reception staff were not v polite and our checkin was delayed by   hours as our room was not ready at  pm as promised in the booking not a good start no compensation given pool is nice but nowhere to sit around it so you either swim or stand comfy beds nice decor great location the hotel seems to have lost its gloss no one thing just a series of small things the tv not working in our room the inedible seafood platter in new year s eve the lack of cleaning after new year s eve one of the lifts being out of service the cleaner walking in without knocking there were more things we have visited this hotel several times in the past but don t plan to again the location hotel was full for the new year breakfast is a bit chaotic we noticed things were less well organized compared to a few years ago not everyone seems to understand english that well sometimes there is a long wait for the lifts nicely located friendly staff pool facilities are very good easy to walk up fleet street to the strand wouldn t change a thing we were checked in by esther who was so helpful and patient our room wasn t ready upon our arrival but the general manager upgraded us to a club room gave us tickets to visit st paul s cathedral and a massive ice cream for our daughter faultless service extremely comfortable beds great facilities would thoroughly recommend water was quite cold in the pool beds a little hard breakfast no where near what we expected was just the same a premier inn except it cost   per head rooms a little gloomy and dark location excellent design of hotel fantastic great bathroom soundproofed rooms other than if you re next to the lift very good air conditioning thick light proof curtains some reception staff do not have good customer service skills my room bookings were mixed up and my son was asked to pay again for the room i had already paid for which caused some embarassment after checking and confirming the room was paid for was no apology made just its ok the rooms were also miles apart as we were advised that one of the rooms had been rebooked so not great despite this the hotel is nice the corcierge lads were very professional and the location is good good location comfortable bed spanear to room and facilities good nothing all good stayed before so knew what it was like the hotel is lovely used facilities this time very impressed with pool and room very relaxed would have liked to have stayed longer found the     per head charge for a hot breakfast very steep we walked   yards around he corner for a delicious breakfast for     not the same ambience i ll be the first to admit hate even complaining about it as the whoe experience was wonderful the entire hotel was wonderful the staff were plentiful but unobstrusive they were there if you needed them but otherwise your privacy was secured the whole place is filled with glass which gives an open clean experience the room was divine and a wonderful view of st pauls and the top of the shard the turn down service was a lovely surprise we have decided to spoil ourselves here again we travel a fair bit and this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed thank you nothing the location is truly excellent three subway lines and two national rail stations are within walking distance we are stunned by the st paul s cathedral every time we leave the main entrance lots of dining options at vincinity the lights within the cupboard were temperamental at best staff also entered room before there was a chance to answer door which felt like a slight breach of privacy comfy bed and a good size room for a couple excellent concierge service was provided allowing us to leave our bags with them at multiple points during our trip bathroom was clean and a good size for the amount of people within room bed had old mattress which sunk into middle pillows that should have been thrown out years ago bathroom was not cleaned properly and sink blocked most unhappy and moved room for  nd night pool and leisure facilities good it s our second stay some of the glass floor panels are damaged and frostedo which is a health and safety hazard for breakfast again poached eggs are done in a different location so had to have fried one long dark hair in the bath my fiancee is blonde excellent location staff were very helpful and friendly the spa explained above the spa is not worth visiting it was one of the main reasons i booked the hotel it had a very cold pool saunas not working my gym has a much better spa i felt really let down as it was expensive reauired a double bed but it was two single beds pushed together so gap kept occurring throughout the night which became uncomfortable staff were very welcoming and friendly food selection in bar was very good nothing i would highly recommend this hotel very friendly helpful staff room was a good size with all the facilities you would expect good service in bar and restuarants seamless check in and check out overall a very pleasant stay and a great location nothing hotel was excellent and location amazing for the area we needed to be in arrived back from our christmas party night at  am and ordered food that was amazing and reasonably priced thank you check out by   when you can t check in until  pm room was a little bit of luxury with lovely interior great shower comfy bed brilliant views of st pauls and the shard room overlooked by two floors of office workers overall hotel was pretty naff felt like a pimped up travelodge lots of office parties poor value for money wasnt the five star experience we d been hoping for location i have no complaints on this occasion very comfortable and quiet had a good meal in the dining room and a nice breakfast staff were very helpful and friendly the location was excellent for visiting the west end as there was a good choice of buses nearby would be happy to stay there again the shower in the room was quite poor it was so close to the wall over a bath that you couldn t get underneath the main water flow unless you were leaning backwards the room also smelt quite musty upon arrival and there was no way to get fresh air into the room as the windows did not open the staff were fantastic and you can not fault their professionalism i suppose like everywhere drinks were a bit expensive and i thought   each for breakfast was too much especially when there are plenty of places to eat   minutes walk away around st paul s cathedral the hotel staff were friendly and very helpful the room was excellent with a very comfortable bed and large shower we ate in benihana restaurant japanese and the food was very very good overall an excellent time at a great hotel will definitely recommend to family friends and work colleagues facilities at the spa were lovely but poor communication about our booking brochure on line not truly representative of what was actually the treatment corporate party on the saturday evening made foyer and bar very busy rooms very comfy well appointed and spacious had a room for   adults and all had a great nights sleep staff attentive and willing to help don t expect the personnel except the concierge to smile or be helpful the bathroom is tiny the noise of the underground ensures that you don t fall asleep before midnight and wake up a few hours later we managed to change bedroom but only after long negotiations this hotel has no soul nothing to report our room   was next to the lift and it could be heard every time used reported that i would like to move rooms no response was told engineer would be to sort it no engineer and no move or contact from staff room not cleaned on day one on our return at  pm had to wait for it to be cleaned bed was comfy pity kept awake by lift noise we found some of the bar staff quite rude which is not what you would expect from a hotel of this quality fantastic hotel with great facilities and a great location we got upgraded to exec room but shower was awful and not to the standard i would have expected cold plastic curtain there was no bath which we were told about but was very disappointed i have stayed in better hotels for much less even in central london the super king size bedno negative i liked the room to the welcoming cupcakes to the spa all of the facilities and the relaxed atmosphere celebrating my anniversary here was the best pick however this time we were put in rooms that are usually reserved for long stay guests and we fkind it extremely inconvenient to walk through the streets nearby to get back to the hotel building for breakfast and to use the facilities we have stayed here many times and think its excellent value for money great location lovely rooms and good facilities less chlorine in the pool dirty plates in the stairwell room was upgraded and perfect view of st paul s cathedral from   will request that room again the bar menu had a poor selection of foods for people with gluten and lactose intolerance so i decided to leave the hotel for all my meals house keeping knocked on the door twice in the morning even though i said i would check out closer to  am the rooms are very small a friend recommended me staying at this hotel and i m glad that i did the location and the hotel itself is great the staff was friendly and easy going it has free wifi available for all guests our room was v dated and not particularly clean dusty the service at reception was slow and at times the staff while friendly weren t knowledgable unable to answer if there is drinking water in room or ability to put coffee on room bill overall aside from pool and gym i don t see how this qualifies as a luxury hotel particularly in london and as such not great value the pool gym and location are good lifts are not sufficient for number of people in hotel we spent a long time trying to get to our room or reception because of this lovely comfortable hotel lovely room service breakfast the hotel had run out of draught beer prosecco vodka and fizzy tonic water by  pm on a saturday night the maid service were knocking on the door at  am when check out was  am hotel is clean modern rooms are great and food is lovely booked with the grange was moved to their second location a block away without prior notification would have preferred to be in the main hotel with access to facilities great location good service shower was blocked and flooded bathroom and bedroom walls in studio apartment were very close to the bed we both hit our heads on numerous occasions over the weekend room service was overpriced and very appalled by the quality of the food bed wasn t as comfy as we both expected for a hotel of this standard the modern design was lovely and the tablet with all functions of the lights and temperature of room was useful breakfast was very busy as the hotel was full so we had to wait sometimes for bacon etc otherwise the food was good for a buffet lovely location with wonderful views of st paul s very comfortable room and generally good service everything perfect booked the hotel for my   daughters birthdays they were upgraded to an executive suite with   queen beds and came in to cupcakes and a happy birthday message it really made their trip very jealous that i didn t go with them they said the staff were fabulous and couldn t do enough for them many thanks to them all we would strongly recommend this hotel for quality service and its central location when visiting london no sooner did i get in our room i could tell it was musty smell the chairs were dirty tired bathroom was really small no shower only over bath pubic hair was on the toilet roll the tv was so small facing no where near the bed i just couldn t stay here went straight ditto reception asked for my cash refund which i payed no more than ten minutes ago they would not refund me they gave me a different room with a walk in shower better bed was horrible we both woke up with stiff backs but the staff put us right off never go there again will tell my friends not to when they do awful no positive like most london hotels the prices are a bit extreme charging nearly   nt and not including breakfast extra   pp nt is a bit much still the pub across the road does a wonderful cooked breakfast for a fiver including tea coffe this place is well positioned opposite st paul s has wonderful facilities and spacious rooms the staff are very attentive and friendly as you would expect from a   establishment paid   for a night and not even a bottle of water in the room tap water was luke warm so that wasn t a good alternative couldn t see if any could even buy from the mini bar as it was locked as i had said i wouldn t be needing to pay a deposit to use it as arrived at  am and would be leaving at  am so thought wouldn t be needing mini bar i was there for business so fine but very corporate certainly not a place for a romatic mini break in london location was good the room was facing a derelict building very noisy from  am as the rubbish from the hotel was collected on the street outside our room loved the location extremely poor lighting and two broken lights in our room a little rough around the edges needs a deep cleanse no view from the room weren t told there was a dress down service in the room so felt uneasy when i returned to find that my room had been moved around whilst i was out there was a party on downstairs during our stay which was very loud and went on quite late i would not award this hotel   star friendly welcome all the necessities provided wifi was good room service was excellent need to raise the standards we wre allocated a poor room first time before reluctantly complaining whilst room was changed and was subsequently great we wre edisspoited as a returning cusopmer we had to push for it the staff seemed disinterested and i felt the hotel since the last visit has lost its soul previously caring nature location nice pool the quad room we stayed in was very small hard for four people to move around the location of the hotel is convenient but outside the main touristy area of london if that is your main intent public transport is close by for easy travel breakfast wasn t included yet it said breakfast available i read that as available it was a birthday treat to stay in a nice hotel ended up in the annexe so didn t get that big hotel experience great location nice room clean the check in staff were a little aloof and busy sorting out things for themselves the queue for check in was in a tight gap breakfast was very expensive at   per head there are plenty of great places to get a full english just in the st paul s area for half the price really quiet for a hotel in the city excellent location right next to st paul s cathedral good room and bathroom size my room had a bath make sure you get a breakfast included in the price of the room it was a fortune for my   kids to eat every morning great location close to shopping and public transportation staff was a little untrained someone walked into my room whilst i was getting changed he had knocked on the door once and then just unlocked the door even before i could say wait a minute please i rushed to the door as he was about to come in and i said that i wasn t dressed he apologised and waited outside while i got my dressing gown on then he came in and said that he was here to check the minibar which was locked so i don t quite understand what there was to check and then left quickly after apologising again i just thought that it was quite rude great location no negative good location nice attentive staff got an upgrade to a better room in the older part of the hotel the room wasn t up to my expectations and time was too limited to change still giving a good review because the case was followed up and solution had been offered assuming that the new part of the hotel is quite good no negative we spent the weekend here for my mothers  th and we loved it the location was perfect it was close to everything we wanted to do the staff were lovely we will definately be going back there room was a bit smaller than i was expecting for a family room and for the price impressive interior and great location returned to our room after a night out to find some birthday cup cakes which was a nice touch the lights in the room were a little confusing there was a nack to working out how to turn on the one you wanted without turning them all off or the one across the room on early check in or late check out wasn t really an option or at least not made clear extremely friendly staff who understand the concept of excellent customer service great rooms fantastic facilities nothing its was all great and made my wife s   birthday complete i am younger just for the record the staff were excellent location first class and could not be better poor quality bed and mattress very poor pillows window wouldn t open expensive minibar blocked bath sink terrible taste in the bar furniture good location for work meetings and some tourist attractions great staff and friendly having stayed at this hotel several times it is sad the roof terrace is always booked for private events the check in staff in particular one is excellent and always tries her best to deliver a professional service this is the reason we return back on a regularly no negative we stayed at the grange st paul s following a conference nr cannon street and it allowed a great evening at the tate modern and a meal and walk along the thames the room was wonderful and quiet on the  th floor and we used the spa the following morning the pool was lovely and steam room and jacuzzi lovely was also very quiet at   cold pool rooms are very well appointed and the facilities are excellent you can use hdmi to watch netflix etc via your own smart devices which is great if you have children or you can t wait to watch the next episode the location is brilliant with quick and easy links to shopping theatre and dinning all good however would have liked to have been able to have an evening drink on the roof terrace terrific location good reception staff so great initial welcome room was to a high standard and the spa was ideal for my visit everything was as expected so i was very pleased with my visit we were only given one small bottle of water for   people when we asked for more were told it was hotel policy to only provide   not   star won t be returning concierge service was very good the bed was a little bit too hard for our liking but you can t cater for everybody s comforts had a lovely complimentary breakfast which i ate too much of the staff were all very friendly and good facilities pillows could have been a bit better but having said that i still slept ok to me this was a good   star standard hotel which is fine if you ve only paid   ish pn for the room i would expect better if i had paid much over that location was really great choice of   bar areas which was good good soundproofing to room lighting in room poor for reading sink was cracked shower door pushed away bath mat and caused wet floor soap wasted as replaced after first day quiet roomno negative the bed was big and comfortable the room was relatively spacious and the hotel in itself is just beautiful check in and check out was quick and smooth problems with arranging taxis from hotel foyer doorman had to run down the street to hail black cabs there seemed to be a long wait for many guests may be this could be addressed first visit to this hotel and we were pleased to have a room upgrade on arrival rashid on desk made us very welcome lovely spa facilities and very friendly staff a hotel that calls itself   star not to have water and for the milk in the in room mini cartons to be curdled is just not on location perfect rooms comfortable pillows on offer were too low for me when i asked for higher type of pillow i was told that all the hotel offers is   type of pillow which was too low for me and therefore i did not sleep well i do not feel that this is acceptable for a   star hotel although i am not expecting a pillow menu of course location and service was generally very good only two central lifts so it made getting from upper levels to the ground floor tricky at checkout time great location minutes from st pauls and the tube with lots of local eateries room size was good best bit was the swimming pool and jacuzzi the concierge were really helpful and all the staff were very friendly we went down to the bar which was only open to guests till   then the public could also join a member of staff asked to see my room card i thought this was rude i asked for a cake secretly to be put in are room for my partners birthday and they kindly did length of time we had to wait checking in put on extra staff at  pm and again  am for check out we were given an automatic upgrade however when we got to the rooms they were not correct double we wanted   twin beds i had to return desk and another two rooms were allocated elsewhere when i asked for a complimentary breakfast to compensate for the hour and half it took to get the whole thing sorted i was told i already had an upgrade when i pointed out that was their choice at the original booking and not something we requested it fell on deaf ears location i ve stayed at a great many hotels in london this was the only one that didn t allow early check in seemingly a policy and not simply because the room wasn t ready they did invite us to shower and change in the spa which was lovely but it was rough not being able to nap a bit after a long overnight flight the location was amazing we loved being so near st paul s cathedral it s kind of magical lots of great dining near the hotel and the hotel was very nice it didn t have the charm of some of the hotels we ve visited in london but had some great amenities i orded a drink for my wife and was charged   for a baileys with ice to much great room very good hotel i recommend this hotel im a london taxi driver andit is in a very good position in london i was told we d been upgraded we hadn t some of the furniture was damaged we asked for additional milk and were told to contact housekeeping or room service the much crowed about sky bar was closed we told reception staff that there were french fries spilled on the floor in the corridor two hours later there had been a half hearted attempt to clear them it looked more like someone had tried to kick them out of sight i accept the lifts will be busy at check out time but to have to stand for     minutes frustratingly watch lifts either flash past or be too full isn t good especially when there s another lift within   yards shame it wasn t sign posted i m sure it ticks all the boxes needed to classed as   star but the lack of attention to detail means i ve stayed in better   star hotels check in was quick and efficient and although we were well before   pm we were allocated a room we were even told we d been upgraded we hadn t the guys on the door were always polite and pleasant no negative fantastic location right next to st pauls cathedral it s an amazing experience to go to one of the choral services very close to underground links to theatres and the west end and minutes walk away from the millenium bridge and the south bank area can t think of anywhere i d rather stay when visiting london nothing having let the hotel know that it was my wife s birthday and they delivered a couple of cupcakes to our room a lovely surprise when we returned from the theatre room service price rediculously high i asked for egg on toast and coffee and got charged     i said on the room menu a breakfast was less the answer given was it had changed price staff on reception are often rude an unaccomodating i asked the doorman where the nearest clothing shop was and got directed to oxford street despite there being a shopping centre across the road next to st paul s very poor value for money the food is terrible cheese bord tiny bits of cheese and the chicken curry cheap cuts of meat location is good t comfy bed the upgrade to an apartment was an unexpected and appreciated pleasure i liked the pool although i thought the step into the jacuzzi was an accident waiting to happen our overall impression was good and i would come back again for a   tv in room was way too small shower knobs were very seized up and difficult to adjust no complimentary bottled water in room which i would expect in a hotel of this standard location is great good leisure centre pool comfy bed my only issue is room service breakfast was only a bit warm and not hot as it should have been everything was perfect great hotel great staff great location great service the staff they seemed to be not sure of what they was doing especially the spa the porter didn t carry our stuff to our bedroom we was left to carry it and there is no valet u have to go around the block to park in an expensive ncp don t take your nice cars the cafe rouge outside is rubbish not much for lunch on offer the bedroom was comfortable and offered exactly what it said shower was great the hotel appearance was nice and the room service staff was attentive breakfast was great you get a lot for what you pay only thing we had an issue with was the fact they took a pre authorisation transaction which was nearly double the amount of the room which then left me overdrawn don t know why they took the money in the first place or tell me what they were doing the bed room was lovely very spacious and clean the bed was so comfy got dressing gowns and slippers too can t fault the actual hotel staff are mainly untrained young people checkin and checkout was a catastrophy waited each time half an hour for my turn and then didn t even know how to handle their own software in addition i could not reach the room service by phone at     pm in the evening when i needed another toothbrush breakfast a bit of old jam and bread not worth the money no one came to offer a second cup of coffee or tea during breakfeast don t want to be too picky but for this kind of hotel and money you pay i expect sth much better this was more worthy to a youth hostel or budget hotel great location great rooms lousy staff mini bar locked despite the receptionist taking a cover charge off the credit card was opened upon request only one bath towel but reception send a hand towel very large bed and well appointed room clean and comfortable the spa as always was excellent for the size and standard of the hotel we had a room overlooking the restaurant and therefore felt we could not open the curtains as people could see into the bedrooms from both the restaurant and the other bedrooms facing us i would not want one of those bedrooms again the quietness at night that allowed for a good nights sleep after heavy days of walking and sight seeing where do i start the whole hotel does not have phone reception literally i expressed i had to call my childminder allot and no phone reception in all of the hotel you have to wait outside for phone calls second they will not take a cash deposit for the minibar so you aren t allowed to access it without paying by card rediculous i offered them   pounds cash the food is disgusting and overpriced   for some scrambled egg and a coffee to the room the pool that s only advantage grange st paul is   stars hotel but the service is far from being what you would expect the rooms are big and very comfortable but half of the rooms those of the inner court which are nice do not have cellular coverage this was told to us by the night manager which is very strange as this hotel is in the city of london mainly for business customers value for money was good as at the end of august the rates were not high for london location is ok if you want to be around the city like visiting the tate modern which is a great building and see the royal stock exchange but it takes time to get to the main tourist attractions of london as i wrote the service is almost not there unfortunately i broke one evening a teeth and had to go to an emergency dental care the hotel does not have a list of medical doctors and emergency dental doctors although this is a big hotel part of a london s hotels chain even in a small   stars hotel in oban in northern scotland they do have dental care list the concierge does help with printing airline tickets and this kind of service but the whole stuff lack even the minimum kindness of a hotel location for city attractions front desk attitude room is comfortable rates were reasonable no negative the bed was really big and extremely comfortable and the room was bigger than expected the spa and gym facilities were very good also it was a perfect location and a lovely walk to the restaurants across the millennium bridge the view was amazing very easy to check in and out the whole process of booking was so easy they even left complimentary happy birthday cupcakes for my boyfriend staff were rude to the extent that there was no thank you or please in sentences could be because a lot of staff were eastern european and didn t have the british formality elegant hotel with good sized rooms and excellent gym and spa facilities disappointed the skybar closed before the  pm time stated on a saturday night nice and comfortable a great view of st paul s out of our bedroom window friendly and helpful staff our window looked over reception so we had to keep our blinds down all day poor service in the bar took the girl   attempts to take a snack and drink order for   and we were given the bill before they would serve us two queen sized beds in our twin room leisure centre is lovely decent sized jacuzzi and pool for a city centre hotel there was no view and i asked for a view some of the staff were a bit flippant the location was good room was clean and tidy some of the staff was helpful and friendly others not so no negative the welcome from a lady called norilyn at reception who checked us in was exceptional friendly and charming to say the least the room was amazing and the hotel is beautiful couldn t have picked a better place to spend my weekend the staff could have been friendlier and more helpful in their service and approach i asked for a room with a view and got a brick wall literally air conditioning wasn t working properly the tv was on a fixed stand so unable to watch it while getting ready or in bed i think you are missing an opportunity with the roof top bar needs some tlc and more drink options cocktails would help we didn t realise on booking it that the location wasn t great no nearby restaurant s or bars bed was comfy and the pillows were soft quieter floors for not so rock n roll guests x x upgraded due to chap in front of us at check in having a moan up room was awesome and so was brekkie can t wait to go back for another special b day xx more like a   star hotel but the price reflects this good price but it s not a   star spa nice but pool very cold couldn t get in the jacuzzi as it was busy staff lovely and some nice lounging areas in the hotel no negative we stayed in a twin room with enormous beds lovely fluffy pillows robes slippers and a super shower staff were very efficient and friendly especially the waiter in the bar the blind was dirty and broken we couldn t open the mini bar the second shower control didn t work the grout around the bathroom was very dirty around the swimming pool parts of the ceiling were cracked through water damage and parts unpainted i of the treatment rooms didn t work the entrance is beautiful and very posh and the staff are really friendly checking in was for ever and the same for checking out the receptionist kept disappearing and the room was not cleaned over the days we stayed the location and the food and the room was ok the shower was excellent over all the hotel was amazing to look at the bathroom was very small we had to call maintenance for our shower and bath as both temperature regulators were faulty also we could not be provided with a small fridge and the night duty manager was not happy when we asked for the automated chiller to be emptied so we could keep some water and juice chilled the location and the lobby areas of the hotel the staff at reception were very pleasant and accommodating booked the double deluxe room and stated   square metres i am not sure who measured this but it was normal size hotel room also our room over looked the main entrance with rooms on the opposite side having to keep the blind shut for most of the stay plasma lcd telly in the room was small and couldnt move it so awkward to watch from one side of the bed not enough milk sugar coffee in the room for   person never mind   location of hotel was great close to st pauls catherdal and plenty of eating establishments close by also   minutes walk to st pauls tube there was nothing that we disliked about the hotel we had an amazing couple of days there and would definitely go back the staff couldn t do enough for us the rooms were beautiful and the rest of the hotel was stunning with bars and restaurant on site the architecture of the hotel was fabulous no negative this was the  rd time we had stayed at the grange st pauls and it didn t disappoint excellent service and facilities as always we will be returning not like air con and prefer to have windows which open overlooking the atrium and other bedrooms a little disconcerting light and airy bedroom enjoyed the swimming pool close to the south bank the towels were not   star flat and thin it would have been great to have access to the roof bar as the weather was lovely and the views would be spectacular my room faced into the hotel only had the room deal so didn t try the food and i didn t get time to try the pool or gym best part was location very easy to get around price of breakfast to expensive for us bed very comfy spa and changing room very high standard has everything you need even straighteners steam room the hottest i ever been in fab location for st pauls and visiting city plenty of restaurants on your doorstep absolutely untrained staff who can t make a proper jug of tea for two people they actually put one teabag in a litre of hot water our room was allocated to us and to another couple who opened the door while we were naked waited in the bar for   hour for our meal to find out that it wasn t ordered on the first place the area bed extremely hard and uncomfortable no complementary water only offered to regulars even though i have stayed here atleast half a dozen times room decor is also extremely dated and what is expected of a   star hotel television very small and not easiest to view from the bed lastly not all staff have a great grasp of english which should be unheard of in a   star establishment location is perfect and pool steam room is a very nice treat no complimentary water in the room for such a good hotel that seemed poor the bed was very comfortable the spa facilities were great central location perfect   generator noise made it hard to sleep heard other guests complaining too at check out   it took more than   mins to get on the elevator at check out time couldn t use stairs as had a pram luggage   front desk person on checkout was not very pleasant at all   breakfast food was reasonable but had to hunt down a server to get some coffee and our plates were not cleared at any stage   very unclear whether breakfast was included was told it was on check in and on the first day of our visit at breakfast there was no problem and then when at the entry on the second day we were told we would have to pay went to cafe rouge next door which was nicer anyway   location   they accommodated us having an adjoining room   well appointed rooms   good room service and housekeeping staff are obviously quite efficient   for a croissant and coffee and one cooked breakfast very hectic like a cafeteria certainly not value for money should have gone up the road also not able to have evening drinks on rooftop terrace as private functions both evenings disappointed clean room nice bathrooms pool area very nice clean and well organised fantastic location lovely staff we had view to the wall which not allowed us fully enjoy best location in the city excelent location pool gym and spa are included good design huge rooms for london windows from floor to ceil no view from my room but appreciated the natural daylight after the first room very comfy bed quiet room the first room i was shown didn t have natural daylight i asked to move and was moved within minutes no phone signal in the hotel nowhere to just get a quick pastry in the morning had to be a sit down breakfast luxurious facilities gorgeous bathroom comfy beds room allocations were muddled up after having checked in at  am and as agreed with hotel by e mail we could leave our bags and told room would be available when returning that evening when we returned our room had been allocated to someone else the replacement room bedding had to be changed as it was dirty and this all took time we were promised contact after we left but have heard nothing and we have stayed here before so even more disappointed with the service we received location not all the facilities in the pool seemed to be functioning coffee was rather expensive compared with nearby restaurants and cafes the facilities were good we liked the pool the staff were very professional but friendly and helpful excellent location the lighting was quite poor in the room by the full length mirror it was very dark felt like the full length window which over looked offices allowed them all to look into the room i didn t want to pull curtains because it was the brightest part of the room but felt like we were on show would have loved the option of a view would have been better to have had a   o clock check out instead of earlier training staff were left to their own devises could see she was struggling and her colleague watched on and ignored her with out any help left disappointed was looking forward to staying and location it was an ok room training staff were friendly bedroom was disappointing quite small not very clean shower leaked and tiles were a bit grubby room was for   people but only two cups and two glasses provided the lounge and bar decor was lovely very attractive looking reception area nothing the hotel is full of life all the time and there s a   hour starbucks on site the design of the hotel was amazing and the staff could t be nicer can t say anything good enough really not so much space in the room to stock clothes and stuff one night there was a party on the upper terrace heavy bass drum locations is perfect rooms and street are quiet i have stayed here previously and felt it worthy a revisit the room allocation this time was clearly in the older block dark and dreary we had booked a triple room but only set up for two and we had to request extra towels and amenities numerous times i will not be staying here again no positive breakfast was very disappointing fruit was all canned porridge made with water and not cooked enough   for full english but still charged an extra     for a cappuccino or latte coffee very lacklustre no positive room size very small for an executive suite very disappointing could not use top floor bar because of private function maybe this needs to be pointed out on booking because it would of been nice to finish our evening at this location location my room has telephone reception so i couldn t receive or make any calls on my mobile through the stay i also booked the airport transfer at the hotel   minutes after the scheduled departure time i was told that the driving was not coming for some reason the hotel asked a black cab to take me to the airport for   pounds i ended up paying   pounds as i didn t want the cab driver to suffer any loss no positive could improve signage to help locate where the spa was other than that it was great the room was lovely and clean the facilities were great and use of the spa was much appreciated booking a massage for the morning was easy and the staff were really helpful at getting us settled not to mention the massage itself was amazing we had room service for breakfast which we thought was great value for money and tasted lovely no negative we stayed here the night before doing the ride london cycle event and the concierge staff were very helpful and accommodating with looking after our bikes overnight and our luggage during the event we were also able to use the spa facilities after the event having checked out which was fantastic breakfast very expensive shower cubicle couldn t contain water flow resulting in a wet bathroom floor no price list seen for mini bar adding   to credit card pre authorisation on check in comfortable beds and clean and spacious rooms good tea making facilities sufficient hanging space in wardrobes good range of bars and restaurants ideal location for central london and the south bank the internal rooms look over the atrium and are therefore not very private with the curtains open the lifts are quite slow and there are only   in the main reception area therefore getting up and down during peak flow times can be time consuming the breakfast was not included in the room rate the rooms were well appointed and the bathroom shower was excellent fantastic central location within a short walk of central line tube stations shops bars cafes and restaurants polite friendly staff afternoon tea food was ok but staff didn t come over to us once to top up pots of tea etc i had to go to bar to ask hotel in general good liked the decor   pound for a gin and tonic check in at   pm and check out at   you can pay by the hour for late check out just another example of being ripped off in london hotels i was given a room with an excellent view at   pm excellent gym pool excellent location excellent food at bar great staff very friendly and helpful located around lots of restaurants and cafes some reception staff could have been friendlier quite dismissive at times i wasn t even asked how our stay had been even though we had been there for   nights reception staff obviously don t get on with reservation staff quite a dispute between them when we tried to book a further night most of the bar staff also very off hand great location near the tube station lovely room and very good cleaning of our room daily restaurant and bar very busy with corporate events and hence service slow served flat house champagne in the bar had to send it back didn t bother with breakfast and walked down to borough market instead rooms comfortable but feel they are more suitable for a business stay rather than leisure location size of the room was too small and bathroom shower was super tiny you could barely stand in it and water leaked out of the shower door making the floor super slippery i liked the location bedroom facilities not checked hairdryer not working and alarm clock alarm not cancelled waiter in novello restaurant for dinner has not been trained well no knowledge of menu or appreciation of time needed to review menu steak not served as per menu with broad beans breakfast coffee service slow and tables not laid fully for a   star hotel it is not acceptable to have multiple staff who do not speak and understand english especially in restaurants i have a few tripa to uk coming up and would like to stay each time but these points cause me to hesitate comfy bed bathroom well equipped space on arrival we were put in a twin room when booked a superior double but one call to reception and we were in an executive room for the inconvenience great service excellent bed great spa lovely staff the hotel room was not as well cleaned as expected and nor were the bar area toilets the bar food service lacked service finesse for a   star hotel well suited and catered for travellers with young children good location next to the thames and quiet air conditioning too complicated and unreliable so room too warm at night no hand shower mirror on wall too high to view when sitting at dressing table location health club expected room to be bigger for a superior double cost but i guess it s in london great location for visiting london great facilities and nice rooms the check in process very long queue despite having already checked in but room not available at the time they should have a desk for key collection only overall the location is great and within easy reach of the tube station it would have been nice to see a brighter colour scheme in the bedroom to mirror the reception area the reception area is spacious well appointed the room was of a good size with a comfortable bed top ups of coffee milk etc were excellent there was never any need to ask the property is huge so make sure to request the rooms to be next to each other if booking more than one we spent ages trying to find each other s rooms running around between different blocks amazing location beds very comfortable the iron and ironing board in the room was definitely useful the staff was friendly and very helpful no negative the room was large and well appointed unlike many hotels in london and the location is very convenient if you fly into city and have work on the eastern side of london took   minutes to check in then we were given the wrong room despite being asked if it was a twin we needed breakfast was very poor spa needed some seating around the pool great location hotel was beautiful and very clean on arrival walking into the hotel with the euro   football on the dead flowers in the floral display at reception and the cigarette ends on the floor in the outside bit as we made our way to our room immediately made my heart sink the dead flowers and cigarette ends had been removed by the morning but as a first impression it made me feel disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary and it didn t feel very   we d also had a complimentary upgrade to a room that had disabled facilities the receptionist said the room only had a lower sink and more space in fact the bathroom also had a disabled shower seat and hand rails here and by the toilet which if truth be told made us feel old and was an instant romance damper on our first weekend away without the kids in   years so beware of upgrades also we were on the  th floor and the lift temperamental and painfully slow at times so we opted for the stairs more than once the location of the hotel was perfect the spa and gym facilities were very good the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet we didn t eat at the hotel so cannot pass comment on the food but it looked fine hot food although lovely could have been hotter a supervisor or head of housekeeping sort of gave us a telling off and upset my daughter but maintence of room excellent although not consistant special requests were taken and granted and staff overall brilliant beds fabulous and room so comfortable felt special and just loved being there really special treat for myself and little girl as a girls weekend away wish we could have stayed another night rare weekend away with friends for  th birthday was made extra special by the friendly helpful staff comfortable rooms delicious food relaxing spa and general ambience all made a memorable experience and one we will repeat next year not being able to visit the roof top bar because there was a private function this should not be advertised as a guest facility if it is not available for guests location was great there was a great rooftop bar but it was always busy with private functions great location i was attending a wedding at st paul s and the location was just perfect really bad hotel nothing works properly very dirty and disorganised staff constant flow of small problems also very kitschy and bad taste from restaurants to elevators no positive studio apt on ground floor with full length windows onto street meant there was no privacy unless curtains blinds were closed making room very dark breakfast was adequate however staff seemed unable to cope with full dining room quality and understanding of english was very poor location the breakfast on sunday was not very warm plenty of choice but not as nice as saturday s shower was great to ease the days walking around a busy london spa area wasn t very relaxing as there were children splashing about and racing in the pool whilst we were there very friendly and attentive concierge staff very modem hotel design nice bar area view of st paul s from our room very comfortable bed very good massage treatment was looking forward to sitting on the roof top bar and seeing the views but only for private functions looking forward to the night club but was closed staff where lacking in knowledge of drinks not knowing what cider was room was not made up during the day overall for a   hotel poor advertisement of facilities and very expensive for the service we received loved the location manager dealt with our complaint with a free breakfast for two room was poor not   star broken bit of shower on floor when we arrived and had a lot of problems with the plug sockets tripping the fuse box constantly which was a pain during our stay concierge were very good and sorted it out but it kept happening about   times without us even in the room think we were just unlucky spent   for one night and breakfast which is a lot when everything isn t perfect swimming pool was very busy too loved the breakfast although expensive   for family of   loved spa facilities especially the lovely hot spa loved the little touch of muffin birthday cakes left in the room gym was lovely and dance studio teenagers loved the health and soa facilities bar food on one occasion lovely and on another not good at all sharing platter the bar staff had a tendency to be slow serving but overall the staff were very attentive the sports bar was booked on one occasion and guests were not permitted in fabulous room view lovely roof terrace when available for guests spa very good lovely pool great location in a beautiful part of the city close to the tube shops and lovely restaurants and a two minute walk to the millennium bridge overall excellent and would stay again the reception staff were a little strict not as pleasant is they could be we always find the hotel is very comfortable and an excellent location and good value expensive spa treatments and the tea at breakfast was awful i genuinely never usually have a problem with many places but please please someone look at the tea you are serving people in the morning there should be a pot of tea on the table not someone filling up your cup as if it s coffee because mine was terribly brewed the spa was fantastic but the treatments were quite overpriced no negative we stayed in the hotel for our wedding anniversary we absolutely loved the place it is very conveniently located close to covent garden the strand and trafalgar square the staff were very friendly the rooms were comfortable and very nice internal signage was a bit hit n miss eg no information in lifts on what facilities on each floor spa etc excellent location next to st pauls and views from room awesome the quality of the food at breakfast there was only non fat yogurt in a pot perhaps some fresh greek full fat yogurt in a bowl perhaps some interesting granola the waitresses did look like they had an early start low grade sausages and bacon not really cooked location was excellent lifts were slow we changed rooms as the first smelt heavily of smoke and this was done with little hassle to a better one a lady on the same floor and i met in the lift saying it too so when we went to the desk together they must ve known there was a problem very busy pool not the hotel s fault but pool area felt small for the number of guests we asked if we could get a room early were told no as we already had an allocated room number which meant we had one of the nice rooms this is a secret according to the receptionist didn t really believe that and i m sure it was just the receptionist s way of getting us off her back true to form the room we got was small tiny twin beds one of which didn t look like it had been made as was all lumpy aside from a white sheet no other covers on the bed i have stayed in far better rooms at this hotel which is why i know to be disappointed standards seem to have fallen generally client facing hotel staff receptionist concierge spa staff are not overly friendly and often quite curt booking com overview of the hotel said it included a continental breakfast but at check in we were told no breakfast was included clean hotel friendly cleaners see my comment about client facing staff being much less friendly and excellent location spa is also nice although can get crowded theres no alternative choices of the spa massage usually fullybooked all the time or lack of masseuse i dont like the view in my room facing the wall of the other building the staff were very helpful and friendly industrial doors opening at  am in an adjoining business but that s a minor point and not something the hotel could do anything about great location i wanted to explore this historic part of the city enjoy an out of my ordinary level of comfort and style very happy guest who will be back o although i had to pay for an upgrade and the room was nicer then the first one i had my room was tired and required decorating the wall paper was lifting up and i think the last night my room was over priced the staff wee excellent the view was very good albeit i had to pay for an upgrade ipod dock was not upto latest iphone spec spa was a little disappointing thought the pool was chilly and hot tub had no jets for shoulders also thought there were loungers to relax on but having seen it it is obviously too small for that gorgeous comfortable twin room amazing shower and bathroom staff extremely helpful location was brilliant there s nothing not to like love everything about the grange st paul s we stay here everytime we visit london which is quite often with and without the kids the rooms are fabulous spa is fabulous must eat at benihanna lovely atmosphere in all of the hotel staff are fabulous too can t wait for our next trip the view from the hotel room was the starbucks inside the hotel very bizarre as i have never experienced opening the blinds to see members of the public drinking their morning coffee before would have preferred an outside view the bath needed a larger shower screen as it tended to leak all over the bathroom floor the tv was small and located offset from the bed so was not ideal for viewing purposes the location of the hotel was perfect right next to st paul s cathedral within easy walk of other london attractions the staff were friendly and helpful and were efficient in helping when we had an issue with the tv modern decor with a trendy twist good spa facilities the pool facilities are very limiting and the breakfast service is not as well prepared and some of the other grange hotels staff were extremely helpful and accomodated to our needs well even offering us a room upgrade one guest asked for small gift to be left in the couples bedroom which it wasn t the grooms sister in law was very upset lots of guests some were offered breakfast upgrade but i was told this meant moving to another building which i explained not good as i was responsible for getting the bridesmaids into their dresses yet it was attached so would not have been a problem if it had been explained properly the bridal suite was not cleaned at all very bad service liked the decor and location was ideal for the wedding we were holding very poor food from the room service for   the pizza and chips wasn t that great also the showers real bad design not much to be honest it was very airy in the entrance that was a nice feature we did not book the spa in advance hence no appointments for the whole of our weekend stay advise booking in advance staff very welcoming spacious light lobby and lounge area proximity of thames and st pauls arrived at  pm rooms not available when available not clean long wait at lifts in morning over   mins no drinking water in rooms for high cost rooms no mobile phone reception in rooms high charges on land line difficulty in obtaining land line location location location   star accommodation no way near to   star we found food under the bed which shows higenic standard of the hotel we booked room for   people but everything was prepared based on   people sauna was not working but there was no apology basically our weekend was ruined no negative hotel is very clean staff are helpful i ask for a few items which was sent which helped as it was my birthday breakfast was amazing definitely would go back again stayed last year and the croissants and pastries were the best i d ever tasted this year they were quite disappointing brilliant service from start to finish the drinks were a little pricey but it is london we went for my husbands birthday and very much enjoyed the spa and complimentary birthday cup cakes everyone was really friendly and helpful room was ridiculously overpriced drinks also very expensive at the bar   for   g t s we were taking our grand daughter for her first trip to london and struggled to find a hotel that would accommodate   in a room although the room was very nice it was no different from any other and in hind sight it would have been far cheaper to book   double rooms we were charged   for a triple room the guy booking in next to me was quoted   for a double wouldn t stop us going back but we re a little wiser and poorer location was excellent room was good and bed very comfortable great facilitiesno negative from start to finish was excellent the hotel is in a great location great staff and great value for money can t recommend highly enough oh and don t forget the spa facilities they have available the staff are very rude including the manager who called me a liar the views are not very good apart from the rooftop terrace the spa is lovely nice location with alot of nice restaurants and bars close by no negative the facilities were excellent the hotel was in an ideal location in the centre of london with lots of restaurants locally and shops the staff were brilliant really friendly helpful would definitely recommend this hotel for somewhere to stay in london and will be considering going back i did not take breakfast but my partner did and he said it was a bit over priced for what there was there perhaps it was just his taste classy looking establishment very comfortable rooms you have everything you need it is not a great location at the weekend because the city is so dead but it was convenient for me because i was attending a course nearby no negative   star hotel with everything you would expect i got a deal so in fact probably paid a three star price room v very quiet v good location fantastic in the city and a minute from st paul s room temperature was hot  o and only way to control this was the noisy air conditioning manager was very accommodating to a last minute request i had to use the roof terrace for a special occasion more could be made of the sky bar as it was more of an outside area to which you could take your drink as opposed to a bar hotel is in a good location and the spa facilities are great given the central location no negative room overlooked st paul s cathedral and was a   minute walk to the tube or the thames clean bedroom and bathroom and comfy bed perfect inexpensive weekend hotel in london will definitely be back the sky bar was booked for private functions on both days we managed to go up there on sunday to appreciate the spectacular view but the bar wasn t open lovely view of st paul s lovely area with easy accessibility to attractions and train station underground friendly helpful staff comfortable bed and nice bathroom birthday cupcakes waiting in our room was a nice touch the pool and spa were understandably busy maybe a bit too busy not their fault though comfy beds lovely spa amazing location helpful staff very very very good i was extremely disappointed and went to reception and identified the issue to fredricah who assured me someone will get back to me nobody bothered the property has very few faults breakfast poor value and noise in room was awful could not sleep asked to be moved and manager pretended it was nothing then said he had no space been   today mess would not return to stay check in seamless and spa crazy sensor mini bar system lost to remote and looked under the bed and there was a sweet packet and some other rubbish left under it comfy bed nice room good shower and bath breakfast not included no water free in room first bottle not replaced afterwards no toothpaste in room option for lights in the bathroom being low as well as full shower there were stains on the throw and cushions and what looked like splattered blood on the ceiling in the bathroom when i checked out i wasn t even asked how my stay was i had meant to write to the hotel but hadn t had time great locationno negative fab rooms great location beautiful hotel loved the pool and spa facilities avoid the glass lift takes forever as it stops at every floor use the lifts to the side of walkway central atrium is very pretty overall really decent hotel waited   mins for a coffee in the sports bar rest of my party were having a drink and watching the football i then waited another   minutes for milk by which time the coffee was too cold to drink response from the waiter was it s not my fault we are busy location and faclities pillows slightly lumpy great location room very clean superb bathroom comfortable bed staff helpful friendly fun having a starbucks inside the hotel which never shuts never seem to have time to use the spa compared to other   star hotels we felt this was poor it was more expensive that i would usually pay but we haven t had a holiday for a while so were taking a couple of extra days after my work conference and wanted something a bit special the room we stayed in seemed tired and dull the pillows were not very nice or comfortable and the shower leaked through the doors there was not any complimentary water which would have been nice and seems usual in other hotels we assume we paid for location and peace rather than anything else the location was really good and despite being so central it was very quiet the bed was reasonably comfortable and there was space the staff were friendly and helpful although this is a big hotel and so it didn t feel particularly personal the majority of the staff especially the bar staff were miserable and very very slow the hotel is great location is great and the facilities are superb the staff are shockingly bad the concierge is unflexible and isn t interested in providing a true concierge service they remained of the opinion that one laundry collection per day was adequate and that no express service was available for anything handed over after    am room service was good air conditioning could have been easier to adjust very efficient check in out procedure high standard of fixtures fittings within the room comfy beds excellent service at the globe restaurant air conditioning instead of windows to open it woke me up in the night and dried my skin out over   days poor mobile signal and dodgy wifi which was annoying clean and comfortable polite and cheerful concierge on the door brilliant location for the tate modern globe and bankside generally a suspicious bartender in the bar who wasnt as polite as he could have been dont think i look like a gangster i m a   year old female bookkeeper lols room was much too hot   degrees c and it took ages with help to get the temperature down to a level where we could sleep comfortably also the room was rather dark i d requested a room with a decent view but did not get one swimming pool is really pleasant room was spotlessly clean location meant that we could walk to many of the places we were visiting the breakfast prices are a little too high especially when you are paying for   adults the bed was really comfortable normally when staying in a double room the beds have been used for single occupancy and you can tell by the mattress i usually end up rolling in the middle there is no phone signal in the rooms and the wifi is appalling makes this place useless for business trips the beds are incredibly uncomfortable and they provide only one firmness of pillow soft even when you ask for firm pillows they send only soft pillows the concierge is the least flexible i ve ever come across around  pm i asked the concierge to wash two shirts for me for the morning and they refused because i d missed the    am cut off the interior facing windows are novel but offer little privacy so once you get over the novelty of seeing into other people s room it s really quite irritating having your curtains closed the entire time the price was ridiculous   night for an exec room when the only difference between that and the superior was a sofa rather than a single seat chair having paid an extra   night for the ritz a few weeks prior i m struggling to understand how the grange can justify the minimal price difference this is far from a  star hotel and i would not recommend this place to anyone the bar downstairs is quite cool and the location next to st pauls and the tate modern is very good room service was on time and everything was delivered correctly the scallops were very good why do you put so many cushions on the bed are they really needed i enjoyed the peace and quiet as i have a very busy life and go to the grange for a peaceful night s sleep the staff were rude and had attitude problem making you feel unwelcome towards the hotel my checkout wasn t until  pm however i was unable to access my room with a key after  am i did an early check in and when i went to retrieve my room keys after  pm the check in time one of the rooms was still not available the receptionist was rude and not apologetic about the situation the hotel was in an idea location close to coffee shops and restaurants and the station the facilities at the hotel were very good one of the two main lifts was out of use which was a bit of a pain during busy restaurant hours a small issue though we spent two nights here for our wedding anniversary and requested a room with a view to help make it a bit more special the hotel obliged by giving us a great view of the cathedral and left two cupcakes in our room with a lovely happy anniversary message i personally thought hotel lacked character booked a suite was given a small double went and complained room was changed to a large suite with a view of st paul s was asked at booking if special occasion emailed to say hubbys birthday have stayed at lots of hotels in london for birthdays anniversaries etc and always something in room complementary cake wine here nothing lol we were not treated well by the staff and that included the manager the staff charged us twice when we extended our stay refused us breakfast and apparently is was to included but it was which we were told by the manager could never happen we had someone come into the room in the middle of the night shouting security this was also dismissed finally the manager admitted to making up for this and we never heard from him i tried to get his email but he was reluctant the location is great the hotel decor is really nice the rooms are clean and comfy wifi was poor unable to connect and when connected kept dropping off breakfast was disappointing quality check out was slow lifts were slow and on night   there was a weird generator noise in the room   large comfy beds lovely spa swimming facilities had to move from  st room as overlooked by office workers air con confusing did not eat in hotel loved the pillows but too many cushions to accommodate at night the price of food and drinks was a discrace paid   for   nights should have been   and breakfast wasnt even included spa and pool was nice room was clean and comfortable the breakfast was terrible and not what i expect of a   star hotel this was via room service the toast wasn t good and seemed to be quite cheap bread and sausages the scrambled eggs were not to standard the location was perfect and in listening distance to the chimes of st pauls the staff were very friendly and professional and assisted me as i was on crutches and wearing a knee brace the staff charged me twice for the room not cool despite me telling them that i d already paid they charged me a second time staff training required location is amazing and the room was fabulous bed extremely comfortable and a three headed shower is always a bonus my only gripe was the bed it was so hard i did ask for this to be seen to but was not contacted over the last two days of our stay a lovely hotel with very friendly staff in a great location easy access to cafes buses and underground small room small shower hot chocolate spilt by barman got no apology upgrade offerred prior from   bed room to   bed room double charged breakfast it is london but room with a view of a wall pleasant swimming pool spa area building with airy atrium and location all good breakfast price is a bit expensive japanese restaurant is overcrowded or say under staffed i tried to book a table two days in advance no response at all comfortable bed great decor in rooms bath suite best spa massage treatment i had in last two years windows to rooms facing lobby are not one way great view from the glass elevator adjacent be warned room is a great size hotel very full at time of visit easter noise levels were not at all a problem so a good nights sleep broken light in wardrobe noisey air conditioning made a high pitched sound kept me awake missing drinks in drinks cabinet only one glass lift working no positive bed was not comfy both me and my wife woke with sore backs each day also a window which could open in the room would have been good the second lift being out of order the whole week pool sauna etc very good size of room location was perfect very slow check in we were told there was no room ready for us and we were shown to a room in a building off site as a swap we didn t like it returned to reception and a room was suddenly available only   minutes later felt like you were trying to relocate people because you had over bookings and i was just a little irritating as it made our check jn slow and protracted no compensation was offered for the discomfort fabulous location wonderful facilities very comfortable seemed a bit tired and in need of an uplift and enlivening room was a bit dark lacking natural light convenient position quick check in and check out did exactly what it said on the box very quiet and spacious room just did not have enough time to appreciate it unqualified receptionist who booked us in did not check details and she tried to take payment on credit card a second time even though we said we would pay cash also do not like that they hold a payment on your card for at least   days after you have settled the bill in cash the view from our bedroom was a brick wall the corridors are extremely hot the hotel bar appears to allow anyone and everyone to enter for an apparently   star hotel the client le is far from that and the bar was very busy and very noisy at    am no complimentary water in our room we had to go to a local m s to get some the bathroom was quite small the bed very comfortable the cleaning staff very pleasant had to ring room service several times for decaf tea required extra hangers only had five for two people niether came only one lift working service in the cocktail bar poor waited to be served a long time enjoyed the use of the spa also the location was convenient for st barts hospital concierge was very helpful free room upgrade would return to this hotel room smelled of smoke ipod docks are outdated will only got iphone   would have thought they would be more current in a hotel like this mini bar didn t work the spa the hotel was beautiful i booked for a superior twin room we were initially given the wrong room king sized bed etc the new room was lovely but it did not look as sumptious as the pictures on your site for superior twin it was smaller though comfortable i was a bit disappointed though location comfy beds very helpful staff leaving luggage while away flufy white gowns loud staff they were moving furniture late in the evening i called reception and they said it would stop it was an hour after until it did so it was  pm at night i wanted an early night and didn t expect to be kept awake no positive no voile or semi opaque window coverings to afford privacy during daylight hours that forces you to have to close the curtains and turn on the lights rooms are quite spacious and very clean not enough english speaking staff we were offered an upgrade of some sort at reception but couldn t understand what was being offered so declined spent time after wondering what we had declined and it could of been easily solved with clear english speaking staff no positive food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive unfortunately there were  days where our room was missed from the cleaning list and not because we d put the do not disturb sign up it was unexpected and unpleasant at the end of the day to get back and have to sort it out with housekeeping staff in the evening also we were overcharged by approximately   for extra papers and mini drink bar items which we never had when we raised this with reception staff they were pleasant and apologetic in making a full refund but it made me wonder how many people are caught out by not checking the bill fantastic location two rooms booked one double one triple triple room had two queen beds and not three as requested had to change rooms after night out comfy beds heated bathroom mirrorno negative the staff were really friendly efficient and accommodating the location was ideal the grange suites are extremely comfortable very spacious and is only   minutes away from the main hotel room service was very good and prompt no negative the breakfast at   each is a little overpriced i do appreciate that it is london but you don t seem to get anything more special than you would get at a premier inn not clear instruction on when you signing out the hotel and how to do it had to wait in the que for a long time i liked the location and the vib st the hotel staff were friendly when we arrive they pushed two single beds together and put a thin mattress topper on top the beds kept sliding apart causing a groove in the middle i woke up with back pain the throw cushions were stained with something i dread to think what it was the hotel was beautiful nicely decorated and spacious the quality of the rooms was well below what i expected old in need of upgrade connectivity was really poor wifi in room refused to work both days general upkeep in areas not great lift was jamming and stopping hotels can look nice front of house but if the areas where we stay does not match the first impression it is a huge dissapointment service was very good in patches overall very pleasent atmosphere created by the team incompetent reception staff weird system that consists of locking the fridge unless you pay   extra on guarantee is the visa card not a guarantee i woke up in the middle of the night thirsty and because the receptionist didn t explain their internal pathetic rule of locking fridges l ended up drinking the tap water no positiveno negative room facilities very good bed was extremely good nice bathroom great location to explore the city close to blackfriars and st paul s station hotel close to bars restaurant and attractions in city the bed was really quite uncomfortable too hard the hotel itself is nice however location for a weekend break isn t the best so little in the immediate vicinity and particularly a lack of decent restaurants st pauls is just a bit of a nuisance to get to and from no positive the mobile reception in my room was terrible it was in and out of coverage all the time and i was unable to keep in contact with my family while i was in the room i would expect this should not be an issue in five star accommodation no positiveno negative large comfortable bed blackout curtains fully stocked mini bar tea coffee robes slippers and spa complimentary toiletries bars and restaurants everything you need for a perfect stay near london s most iconic and historical cathedral the night club noise which kept us awake until  am when we had planned a relaxing stay even worse when we complained and were told we would be upgraded to a suite if we stayed again the manager then refused to honour this needless to say we won t be staying again also the spa was really dirty sauna was dropping to bits we had planned to use this hotel for our wedding a few years ago and are so thankful we went to the renaissance chancery insteadno positive pool was open to children after designated times good for families bad for solo business travelers not a major issue requested a room overlooking the cathedral which was duly satisfied staff were attentive rooms and hotel were clean and elegant huge variety of bars and lounge area for london location is probably best i have stayed in perfect for both business or leisure although the room is good i do not like the fact that when you give them a card as a guarantee they take money out of your account for your room fee plus extra for damages straight away but when you pay they don t refund the money for     working days why can you have money instantly withdraw but they can t refund straight away no positive the hotel and swimming pool felt a bit overcrowded yes we stayed on a discounted rate for the room but it didn t appear a good value for money we ordered breakfast in and not only the order was mixed up two lattes came lukewarm and pastries tasted like leftovers from yesterday when complained desk staff was helpless manager unavailable promised to call me back never did overall left a bitter taste of the whole stay i would never stay again and would not recommend to a friend there are plenty of other really good hotels in london with similarly good locations but better service spa facilities are very good spa staff is welcoming and helpful location is convenient five minutes from the tube station on the more expensive side in terms of value for money lovely hotel very comfortable and good size rooms with a bath seperate shower location is brilliant on the doorstep of st paul s arrived    pm and had to wait until    pm for my room which had a guaranteed    pm check in had two you g children with me and was offered no gesture indeed i had to complain to the manager at     that i had been left standing around the lady on reception was abrupt towards me facilities and location breakfast was a bit pricey and the bacon was very tough a great location very clean we asked for a room with a view of st pauls cathederal and we were not disappointed as the receptionist was very helpful and the room had a great view nothing it was amazing would have been helpful if the cleaner knew english as we wanted her to clean our room but she didn t understand what we were trying to say it was just perfect especially the spa']"
