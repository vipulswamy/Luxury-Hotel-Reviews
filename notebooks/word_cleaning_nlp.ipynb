              "[' I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer  Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful No Negative No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam  Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge  Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back  My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep  Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character  You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again  Amazing location and building Romantic setting  Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars  Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs  Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it  The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park  Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast  Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that timeNo Positive The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night  The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling  Nothing all great  Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too  6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260  Style location rooms The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast  Comfy bed good location No Negative This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return  The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him  It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it No Negative This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good  Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic  We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment  We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland No Negative Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues  We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely  I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee  Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit  Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area  Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery  The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location  Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing  The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable  Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner  Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly  Nothing  Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning  The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv  Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all  The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around  Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you  Great hotel original concept style We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom  The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits  There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical  The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel  Little bit on the pricey side The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning  Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective  Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern  Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums No Positive Please see above The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible  The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two  The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality  Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great  not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more  Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed  the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet  Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good  Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy  The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything  Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate  Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous  Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again  Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk  Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that  Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning  The brunch to purchase in the morning was good  Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either  The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people  The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else  Massive bed The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups  The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in No Negative The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone  Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here clean and new The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam  My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night  When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all  The location and views  I loved everything  The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eatNo Negative Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepctionNo Negative The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend  there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night  location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed  Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task  Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly  The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference  The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really No Negative Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me  The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management  The property is beautiful The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor  Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again  I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed  Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room  Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe  The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard  Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation  Great trip staff very friendly Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip  Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived  To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing  The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass  Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central  Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone  The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price  The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place  Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra  The young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful Dinner has been cooked excellent  The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive  The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well  upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside  breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added  If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast  Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bedNo Negative The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again  The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction  The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee  Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors  Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed No Negative Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning No Negative We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous  The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money  The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel  I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy  Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room  The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel  We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc  Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful  The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location  The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy  The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel  The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous  Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait  Pretty building interesting rooms  No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up  Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences  We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain  rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done  Large bed  The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere  It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished  In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair  Good location Cheap  So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion  There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas  Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast  The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate  Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center No Negative We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds  Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout  A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding  Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend No Positive split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing  beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud Location Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll  There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant  The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven  it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot  super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location I love amsterdam  Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle  Staff were brilliant Really helpful attentive and friendly Amazing building with lots of history too  Construction during the day though not intrusive Great Customer Service Staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and Metro passes  The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined  The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from  No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance Good water pressure in shower There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place  The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind  The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious  We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub  there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant  Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots No Negative Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level No Negative Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night No Negative This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel  We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel  Very friendly staff lovely comfy room I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20  food recommendations were brilliant The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done  The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience  the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware  Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough  The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine  Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend  Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help  The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level No Positive The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small  Well located if you don t mind taking the train  Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam  The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central Liked the staff The location Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression  Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport  We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick  Room was a great size and comfy bed We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back  The staff were lovely and very helpful Bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links  The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim  There was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent The snacks in the restaurant were also very good The staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful The bed was comfy  We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on  Bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows We stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice Reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful  Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space Very helpful and friendly staff Free WiFi Location and proximity to public transport Provision of iron and board 2 televisions There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night  The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside  It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished  Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history  First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all  Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms No Positive the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor  The friendly staff in bar restaurant The evening meal was excellent A pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful After the building renovations I think this hotel will be fabulous It has so much history and is so unusual Loved it  The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well  The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy  There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work  Great room great staff great food  Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower  Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast  We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow  Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move roomsNo Negative Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know  The fact I had to leave The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished  Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice  The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating  Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay  Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive  Very comfortable bed and cool hotel Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road  Hotel was very clean and staff helpful Very trendy and reasonably priced We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel No Positive The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper  The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase  The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning  Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive  There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major  The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine  More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on  Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room  When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste  The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle  Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost  Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant  Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night  Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower No Negative Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room  The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night  The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable  Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly  Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed  The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid  The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport  I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise  Bed was nice  Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained  Really nice building but lots of building work going off But only outside so not a problem Good size rooms fairly modern Good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram WiFi worked perfectly and quickly  The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms Loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking 24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem  The staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms s good size Nice bathrooms Bar area very comfortable Complimentary drink a nice touch A little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around Plans for development look amazing Would like come back when completed  Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired  Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through  The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk  The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive  Great hotel and quiet university area Wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms The food is wonderful  The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money  The bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our room for the money that we paid No Negative The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive The room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Nothing One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl No Positive Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day  Our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows Very memorable The hotel is right next to a large nice park Staff was friendly  The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu  The rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere Due to building work In progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture  Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent No Positive the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredibleNo Negative The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush  The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards  Room service good quality staff We didn t have a bad experience  We loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling  Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue Hotel was very modern and location was great Complimentary drinks was a really nice touch No Negative Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend The hotel was perfect A short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel Perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy We really enjoyed our stay  Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it  Staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish  They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts  The bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my room Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a room by 2ish which was good  Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting  The room was pleasant We liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom  Nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction  The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp  The room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best I ve ever seen The staff is very kind I would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel 20 min to the center  The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion  The room we upgraded to was very nice  Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool Location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel  Polite staff  The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult  The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam  the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again  nothing In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only  Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center  Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful  The room was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend  Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel Very smart room good food  No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine  Breakfast Staff the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants  staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked  The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel  The hall Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing  Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction No Negative Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend  Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please  Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar No Negative Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive  Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff  Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you No Positive The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times  Good Wi fi No Negative Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building  At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked  The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received  Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc  Character of the hotel was great Location was goodNo Negative Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel  The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future  The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great  Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had No Positive next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sinsNo Negative This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly  Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am  Great location lovely room The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs  Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram  The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift  Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms No Negative It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus  Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all  The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect  No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction  The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice  The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome  We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice  We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows No Negative I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable  Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful showerNo Negative Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town No Negative We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights Hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes Hotel is situated in a quite area The rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy The staff is very nice and helpful Theres nothing we was unhappy with Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airportNo Negative The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home  The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it  Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes  Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets  Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food  n a This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible No Negative We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa  It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre  Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena No bad experiences Amazing rooms with beautiful view of river Food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon Staff are helpful and friendly  floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating staff good location suited us The bathroom needed to be deep cleaned Tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps Loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating Great historic buildig There was a problem with the hairdryer in our room The hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror Just a minor detail really but a bit annoying  The hotel was great The rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly Our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean Drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive The hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes  There were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times How different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram accessNo Negative This is an older building with a wonderful refurbishment Our bedroom and bathroom were state of the art and perfect The dining experience was also excellent We had a problem with one meal but it was fixed immediately Will go back  The variety of the breakfast was not as good Empty marmalade coffee was more water  Was convenient because our friends live close by Furhthermore I liked the possibility of renting a bike on short notice And the interior was spectacular liked the modern twist  Small room in 2 levels connected by a very narrow and small steps The room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc Very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window  The terrace lounge The building The location  Our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night  The staff were very friendly and very helpful  Rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more  Very comfortable big bed Free wi fi Lovely building and interior The only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay 3 days this wasn t an issue  A great place that is stylishly decorated The beds are really comfortable and the shower is fantastic The room we had also featured a lovely little loft with two chairs a desk and a TV the extra space made the place a lot nicer than your standard hotel room No Negative I loved the room There was so much space spanning two floors The staff were super friendly and gave us great advice on locations to visit during our stay in Amsterdam  A bit noisy You can hear a lot through the walls It s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done  Friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look There are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to Central and both go to the main tourist hub Oosterpark right on your door step service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building  location outside terras Minimal space around the bed Breakfast was very good but it wasn t included in the price of the room Right by the Ostpark which is very pleasantNo Negative Super stylish hotel next to a lovely park Close enough to the city centre but far enough if you get me No Negative Standard room is amazing location is adorable Everything was stunning from A to Z from indoors design to really good noise isolation  Our room was small air con leaked and staff wasn t very helpful  Outside of the hotel was beutiful and the surrounding areas The hotel was under renovation while we there which we were not advised of before booking  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very cleanNo Negative Location was superb overlooking oosterpark nice and quiet away from the city centre tram stops very close by and metro not far away  Overcharging for the parking lot  Room was as shown on the pictures cozy posh and really stylish Staff was trully polite and helpful  Nearly everything about my stay The only thing I love was that the bed was comfy and the building on the outside everything else I hated Service in the restaurant was very slow and not the best  Beautiful hotel with views of the park Transport links are very close and excellent I booked a twin room so thought there would be twin beds but got put in a double room with a double bedNo Positive Wifi service wasn t great and we couldn t actually connect  Large clean rooms with a nice size comfy bed All round just very clean  Could hear other people shutting doors but didn t bother us much at all The room was so clean and tidy the bed was amazingly comfey and so big It s just a little bit out of the centre About 30 min walk to the centre  We loved this hotel And our beautiful hotel room No Negative We stayed in a studio room The room was spacious It was clean the bed was very comfortable The staff were helpful polite and professional  There is no enough space in the room my room even to put your clothes  The architecture the bar area the staff are kind and helpful  A little far from the centre but trams frequent Bed was so comfortable Staff we very helpful Had a nice stay at this hotel Room had a bad smell radiator was making leaking sound Hotel was under construction noises started at 7 am Building was so nice rooms were bigNo Negative The hotel building is amazing They are renovating and perhaps some of the problems will be overcome when the works finish  bit noisy dark hallways nice room with bedside on a loft and the nice gesture for a free drink due to renovation of the premises No Negative Staff were very helpful They even organised a little surprise on my birthday Room was great very spacious with huge bed  the room felt cramped the staff at breakfast was a little to busy to help out when asked  the breakfast area is niceNo Negative The staff was very friendly and helpful Loved the old charm of the architecture Rooms were clean Bar had a great courtyardNo Negative Staff were incredibly polite and willing to help at all times Hotel is in a very good location and facilities are brilliant The shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet The room was so luxurious very comfy bed and modern decor Hotel had character  The hotel was situated a little too far out of town  Lovely room taseful decor and artwork around the hotel Friendly and helpful staff  Really nothing negative to say about this hotel Very comfortable beds smart bathroom good shower Lovely facilities garden an absolute delight friendly staff quiet location No coffee or tea in the room or lobby No one to help with our bags from Tax into the Hotel No handicapped access At 80 years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the 12 oursidestairs and then up into the lobby No Positive Room was pretty small for the three of us  The staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities Hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants  Nothing really  We stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation It has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by Laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings Would definitely stay there again  Only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others 48 pounds plus tip  Super location on Division underground line direct to Heathrow and central London Older facility but very accommodating staff Good breakfast many restaurant stores 1 2 block away Bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish Quite comfy but small rooms Beautiful garden in back Overall a great value for London Would stay here again  London hotel rooms are very small There was very little storage Would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage  Breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory Plenty of choices for all Bed was very comfortable Bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water Location could not have been better Very short walk to underground Beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel Very quiet in spite of being close to Earl s Court Rd Staff was friendly and helpful Everyone was very easy to deal with  The room for three people was on the small side  There was a beautiful garden at the back of the property where guests could relax in the sunshine read order a drink etc A great location very close to Earls Court restaurants and tube Good breakfast  Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to  Fantastic location very clean room someone called Leanne I think on reception was helpful and kind Breakfast was lovely great choice  Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night  Breakfast was excellent Staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table  The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good  The garden was a bonus Lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink Secure parking was also a good feature  The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv  Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area  Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back  Location first and foremost Lovely gardens  Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel Very good hotel professional people s and very well organized Unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area Sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure I will pay for this not more than 150 p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level Squeaky floors Difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband Also 4th floor our window didn t open to the outside  Clean comfy beds Beautiful gardens Excellent helpful staff No Negative The staff were all so professional and friendly They really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made The hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the Earl s Court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions I would totally recommend the K K Hotel George  Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves  Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom  The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company  Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel  The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English  Fantastic breakfast buffet Great location Quiet rooms No Negative We stay at this hotel each time we are in London in a nice quiet street just a short walk to Earls Court underground station the staff are always friendly rooms are always cleaned properly it s just a nice place to return to after a long day in London Great buffet breakfastNo Negative Great position lovely having breakfast overlooking beautiful garden Which you could have a walk around or seat and relax Staff were very helpful and friendly  Staff not very friendly Did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed  Location near the Earl s Court Underground VERY convenient Restaurants nearby Good location away from the tourist bustle but very easy to get around London via the Tube  Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there  The staff was very helpful The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold  Hotel was nice and comfortable Very clean Room was a bit small but adequate Staff was friendly and helpful The location was great because it was a 4 minute walk from 2 underground lines Plenty of restaurants convenience stores and ATM nearby  The shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back  We really liked the breakfast There was a wide choice of food The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants It is also close to the subway station No Negative Room as advertised excellent location a 2 minute walk to buses and the tube Friendly and helpful front desk staff Would love to stay here on our next London trip too  choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem  quiet comfy room Very helpful staff Excellent location just off the Earls Court tube and lots of excellent places to eat close by  The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential Closeness to Piccadilly Line and general ambience of the hotel The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra  The location is excellent direct route from the airport at Heathrow The hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar The street is quiet A good hotel if travelling on business  The room is a little small and the decor is dated  The staff were superb very helpful and friendly The hotel is in an excellent position close to the Underground station and easy to get to The room was very clean and well serviced each day  Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples  The location was excellent 2 mins from tube and walkable to several locations Kensington Palace Albert Hall Knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile We received a complimentary upgrade on the room Bed was lovely and comfortable Hotel was lovely Staff friendly and attentive As is just off main road nice and quiet Can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need I always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes I would You ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why Lovely hotel for a special occasion  We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food  We had gluten free breakfast They had separate toaster for gluten free breads But I can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet Otherwise I can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast I just could not eat it Still for sure I could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast Enough for a big man It was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel  breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms  friendly stuff clean location Breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great  Perfect location close to all transports Nice and clean hotel Friendly staff and a really nice garden The area was nice and quiet  Rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean  I absolutely love this hotel The staff is great the rooms are small but comfortable The location cannot be beat This hotel is a 2 min walk to the tube station and from there you can get anywhere you need to go  Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in  Location for tube and central London plus some nice restaurants close by too Staff were very pleasant Breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too  The wifi is only 500kb s which isn t fast by today s standards The power socket near the bed was loosen I can t charge my phone  Generally it s a wonderful experience The hotel is within walking distance of Earl s court station very convenient location There re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel The staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman The room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases The TV is new and major English TV programs are provided Mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so I can make some tea Complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided The cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found Bath towels and amenities are changed everyday The surrounding area is safe to hang around during night It costs only around 100 pounds per night which is a good deal No Negative The breakfast was perfect very clean parking was easy to reach and available even we left the hotel one night to go to Leeds Very kind of the hotel  We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable  The location is definitely the main selling point Wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using Chrome Breakfast coffee was only average Good quality breakfast food friendly and efficient staff We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open  Staff was very friendly and helpful The location was great The room was very quiet  Not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular Great Location with very easy access to public transport and popular location Major Shopping streets walkable A very comfortable hotel Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive  Beds very comfortable Pleasant and necessary lounge area off reception with excellent bar staff Area good for restaurants  The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back Staff were courteous and helpfulNo Negative Location is excellent and easy to get into central London and choice of local restaurants fab Staff at the hotel are friendly and accommodating Rooms are spacious very comfortable and clean Breakfast options excellent and Bar area very comfortable and cosy Big plus is underground parking at the hotel also Fab experience all round  couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice good sized room for the price and wonderfully located having its own bar and restaurant on site was a bonus despite there being countless foodie drinkie options outside their doors No Negative Excellent location near major railway lines Easy to get from the airport Friendly and helpful staff A homely atmosphere and personal attention Highly recommended  Breakfast is expensive especially when I have already paid over 90 for a standard room per night  Location for Central London is perfect Hotel is very clean  mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords Also It would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a 60 euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions When we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith  very good location restaurants and supermarkets around and the clineanliness of the hotel  The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal  Superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her Teddybears 3 Clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening Unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table The underground is only a 2 minute walk so getting around was very easy I am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it No Negative I especially liked my room s well operating walk in non slip shower and bathroom an amenity not always found in other London hotels I also liked the comfortable bed the size of room the good elevators lifts and the proximity to Earl s Court Tube buses cafes shops and ATMs No Negative Thank you K K Hotel George at Earl s Court you assured our stay in London was fun and despite some snow cozy and pleasant Thank you for accommodating our every need from booking theatre tickets to providing cutlery for our take away even letting us borrow the HDMI cable from the business centre Everyone is so knowledgeable and helpful and kind Cannot wait try your other locations thank you again kkhotelgeorge kkhotelgeorge I had to ask at breakfast all 3 mornings we were there for coffee and re fills I think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea Very good location for tube station and getting around all the sights and shows we had pre booked My one complaint is the overly soft mattresses It was not good for my back  Friendly helpful staff The facilities are good including the bar The Earl s Court tube station is just a few steps away and this station has access to several useful lines For what you get the prices are reasonable Very nice breakfast buffet  The mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft I had a neck ache the next morning The room was super tiny We stayed at the Hilton Bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison  The location was just 3 4 minutes from Earl s Court Paul s was also opposite the Underground station making it very convenient to pop by for breakfast excellent Espresso Cappucino and freshly baked pastries by the way before heading off for sightseeing  Temperature in the room was difficult to regulate  The staff are really helpful and accommodating Nothing was too much trouble The hotel is very pretty in a great location with a cosy bar area I have stayed here several times and will definitely stay again  I don t know if it was because I booked through Booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place Underground with no view Unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as I should have done it on check in I didn t know what I was going to be doing on check in Tea and biscuits not replenished the second day  The location Really nothing this was a perfect choice  The entire staff were friendly courteous and helpful The room was clean and quiet and the breakfast was excellent as was the location 4 minute walk to the underground tube just perfect  Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out  Location heated outdoor smoking area breakfast is good Just 2 min walk to Earls Court station Halal restaurants are very close by  Soiled chair in room Pillows not clean Shower temp control very sensitive in 1st room we stayed in Value for money Helpful friendly staff Good locationNo Negative Excellent hotel in every aspect Fantastic location with only a 2 3 minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central London Rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom All the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues Great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone  We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so  Comfy bed a lovely warm room with good facilities on a cold damp London day Great shower nice toiletries and fab fluffy towels Would stay again as it was a great location The things we didn t like weren t the end of the world and we enjoyed our stay  No Iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about  Location fantastic 2 minute walk to Earl Court tube shops and restaurants Beautiful building with parking  Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2  Delicious English Breakfast Staff very helpful and pleasant  Staff not particularly helpful Have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this 3 times Breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a 4 Rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm Its in the right area for what we need Housekeeping missed my room one day and although I did not make much of a fuss over it I did not get a convincing explanation I did get an apology though  English breakfast everyday was a welcome bonus Bar is not impressive but well run kudos to Mariusz who looked after me  room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited overallthe hotel was worth themoney and really handy for the tube good local pub for a great breakfast bathroom is really small great location near the underground 5 breakfast room size consider good when compared to London hotels super fast Wifi Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset  location was pretty good with decent restaurants in walking distance Wifi did the job Range of tv channels Shower was lovely Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall Location near Earls Court Tube stop Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable  Good English breakfast  The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations  Staff on the front desk we re very welcoming  The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym  Very short walk from the tube but not on the main road ideal location  Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of  Location location location and breakfast  Saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening Wonderful bed Impeccably clean room Staff are very helpful and polite The air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc Our room on the 5th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about 3 m2  Comfortable beds quality breakfast nice and helpful staff short walk to the tube The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them The location the room was a little bigger for the usual London hotel room The staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel They provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic I enjoyed my stay overall It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy  Comfortable bed The heating was not working in the room for the first two days Very well kept hotel with a lovely garden Staff particularly friendly and professional A very nice room I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer The Location was good on a quiet street about 200 meters from the Earls court Tube and buses Close to some nice restaurants and pubs for breakfast lunch or dinner Noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional Very comfortable beds well lit room bathroom compact but worked well the staff were all polite and helpful good gardens and quiet location The room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight  The staff are friendly and kindly to help Our room is not in the basement and it s clean especially the bathroom which we care most Briefly it s a good hotel in this price we ll choose to stay again next time  I can t think of a thing that needed improved upon All aspects of my stay were excellent  Stayed in room 226 Comfy bed and pillows Quiet room facing lovely garden Super clean and neat Good size flat screen TV with lots of channels Staff wonderfully helpful Food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants Two minute walk from Earl s Court Tube Also every convenience a traveler could want located right on Earl s Court Road several bank ATMs pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even America fast food if you need your fix McDonald s Burger King KFC and Starbucks There s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry I always remind my fellow Americans who are not used to European hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to US standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank FAR higher in my opinion than wasted floor space  Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars  The position of the hotel was very close to Earl s Court Tube StationNo Negative The location was perfect Stones through away from Earls Court station Staff were all lovely and accommodating Gardens were lovely Cracking Thai restaurant round the corner too Rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy We didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing  Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient  Very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest  Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it  The staff was helpful and friendly The lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant It is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road Very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro  Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help  Bed linen is so cozy lovely breakfast super showers and staff are great and friendly  There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows  Location excellent Staff very helpful  We only stayed 2 nights  The location was perfect close to the Underground restaurants etc yet quiet The food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful The staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful The room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden Perfect conclusion to our 3 week stay in the UKNo Negative This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again  There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK  It was small but comfortable and very quiet The garden was beautiful Breakfast was very good Staff was friendly and helpful It is located only two blocks from the tube  there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12 No Positive The room was really really cold The heating didn t work I was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference This led to a really bad nights sleep  Quiet roomNo Negative K k is a heath hotel that can a person stay on I like it a lot I get a beautiful welcome I think to come next year with my family And thank you for all  Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close  Staff Great friendly Acomodating In particular reception staff and bar man Wednesday night You can open a bedroom window The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm Staff were very helpful Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place  Very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys Only a short walk to nearest subway Nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms Good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff Nice breakfast restaurant Will come back again  Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint  The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well  Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin  Excellent location You have the access to Earl s Court Underground within 3 minutes walk District and Piccadilly Lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially Heathrow without any transfer Many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter  Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors  House keeping quality and service very good Even folded our clothes Breakfast was unbelievable You even had stewed prunes First floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet Loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks Liked the breakfast being made available with room price Obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also Would consider staying here again No Negative Although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city Breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city  Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky  I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few No Negative This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarketsNo Negative close to city center 3mins away from Tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there againNo Positive The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same  This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring  Why carp when there is nothing to carp about  Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill  The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did  Location is very useful for Heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight The place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good  The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control Great location easy transportation to everything Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores Room was very quiet and comfortable The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress  The breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated We especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled Great taxi service was provided when requested  The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better  The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request  Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night  We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London  Bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs  Location Close to some shops and restaurants only 3 minutes walk Underground 4 minutes walk Polite and assistive staff Room space is good Nothing really A lower price is always good of course  Excellent location quiet but easy access to transport Quiet room plenty big enough very clean with attractive garden views Very good breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Would be very happy to stay there again  WiFi was a bit slow  Location was excellent as it was very close to Earls Court station and to the main High street Staff were friendly and breakfast was really good We were given the executive room which has direct access to the beautiful garden My whole family loved this hotel and for sure will book it again when I travel to London  Housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue  Great food very nice bar staff Ex Suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before The temperature of the room could not be lower than 18 degrees which wasn t cool enough No Positive The bathroom is on the smaller side  Excellent location on a quiet street just around the corner from Earl s Court tube station Easy acess from Heathrow Airport 35 minutes by underground A garden at the back adds great value on a summer s day  the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold  It is a smart comfortable hotel and our room was quiet which was something I specifically asked for but  Room was small but adequate There was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though I put some paper on it to indicate its existence Fire alarm went off at 2 am and we were all in the street for a while All was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation  A lovely choice at breakfast with freshly cooked food Staff were pleasant and helpful Good late checkout time  Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident  Convenient location for our purpose Clean and comfortable rooms The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did  Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy  Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either  Lovely hotel great location for Earls Court Tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of London sightseeing and very quiet We had a great sleep both nights  Nothing really  Very comfy beds and helpful staff Easy walk to the tube station Price we secured was very good Access to computers and printers very helpful  Our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke The blackout blind didn t work very well  The hotel and the rooms were very nicely presented Clean and functional Beds were very comfortable  Nothing Beautifully kept large sized garden with separate areas for sitting for drinks afternoon tea Beautiful view of garden from room Very nicely appointed with fresh modern decor in lobby lounge and rooms No problems at all with a small pet Very convenient to well connected Earls Court tube station  Air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead Well located very clean and good sized rooms Bar food and Breakfast was excellent staff very friendly and helpful Definitely stay again They weren t inexpensive  The room was clean the buffet offered plenty of variety and the staff couldn t have been better Leann in particular stood out but everyone was eager to please knowledgeable and responsive Farthest room from elevator Uncomfortable bed Air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room Staff were not interested when told about it We did not sleep well because of it No Positive Room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking Location very convenient to tube nice garden area to sit in after a long day breakfast buffet was very niceNo Negative Conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street Very quiet since it s in a back lane Nice view from the fifth floor  Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal  Like the location as I chose it myself Breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable Bed very comfy Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel Everything except the space in the room Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink  The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious The staff are polite and helpful  Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options  Great selection for breakfast buffet Hotel location great Near Earls Court tube station Loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage Hotel has a bar high is convenientNo Negative We had a lovely stay at K K the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful When we arrived at 7 30 am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the Wellness Center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until 3pm That really saved the day and we had an amazing day in London  Wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive Good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to Earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs Not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired  Excellent staff breakfast was great with a good choice Room very comfortable Location is brilliant and there is very little street noise No Negative the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming The bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business I didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there The location to the tube was excellent Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way  Location is good 2 mins to Earl s Court station Loads of restaurants nearby Tranquil neighbourhood Clean Free printing stable wifi Took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight Temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying  Very comfortable beds Very quiet despite facing the street Excellent breakfast Great location Friendly staff Close to good restaurants and pubs  Not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid Aside from that the hotel was lovely  Room was basic for the price we paid It was very hot in the room and not very much room in the bathroom Spotlessly clean and good location  Its a hit and miss with the reception staff Sometimes I got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained The restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly  I love the location and working Wi Fi The double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate  The breakfast was excellent The garden at the back of the hotel was superb the children could run around let off steam whilst we had a drink in the garden The staff were very friendly Excellent location No Negative The room was compact but bright and nicely decorated Staff very friendly and helpful Peaceful street but very close to Earl s Court tube Would stay there again Occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or 1 floor above quite disturbing Expensive  Good location in Earls court quiet and comfortable  the size of the room is small for Americans but pretty standard for Europe  the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid 15pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious The price for breakfast is a little high I liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot  Let me think about it Nothing really  Perfect location in South West London Very serene and close to the tube station about 250 meters Many restaurants around and nice walk to Hyde Park Very clean and decent place  The restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing The room was spacious and very clean and the location meant it was incredibly easy for us to get about on the underground  I can t think of a single thing  Refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds We had the classic twin which like most London hotels was small but adequate We suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet Location is great as only a block away from the tube with the Picadilly line leading direct to Covent Garden and the theatres  Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip No Positive The toilet was too low to the floor The room was much too hot and the Windows did not open  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely All very clean  There was nothing in the mini fridge It was empty I would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service  The bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby The staff was friendly and helpful The printing center was also very convenient  The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count  Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time  The rooms were extremely small I don t think the breakfast was good value for money Loved the location so easy to access the subway and coffee shops and restuarantsNo Negative Great location just round the corner from earls court station Easy access to all main attractions Comfy room Breakfast excellent choice Staff very friendly Would definately stay again on our next trip to London  The room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows Very helpful staff willing to help Great breakfast and not rushed away as could sit and chat over breakfast Great choice of food in pleasant dining room  Wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great  This is an excellent hotel Location is amazing just minutes from Earl s Court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the City We could easily walk to Kensington High Street Hyde Park Natural History Museum etc Excellent shower phenomenal water pressure Room was clean Bed was very comfortable Staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants Breakfast was very good The hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out We will be back  Room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room Bathroom very small and toilet very low  Good location Parking available although quite expensive Close to subway No Negative staff are always joyful and helpful we were under booked totally my fault by 1 day and on site manager extended our stay in the same room for another thanks for that and also guiding us to the pick up point for our tour of highclare castle so kind of all of your staff thanks doug pat brugger  No water to drink in spa area Room on small side compared to advertised twin room Kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in  Excellent breakfast Could open window in bedroom was quiet outside for London Lovely to have a garden Great mini spa after hectic city No Negative Reception area appealing Check in and out quick Bedroom good size nice and light lovely view of hotel garden Bed extremely comfortable and experienced a good few nights sleep Did not experience any noise disturbance Excellent choices for breakfast very enjoyable Staff very helpful providing us with information and travel advice  Breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne Now more English breakfast which means the cost is pricey at 15 pounds Wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times  Location very convenient walking distance to tube station room clean and comfortable size staff very friendly in hotel  The bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom There is a lack Of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless  The parking is very reasonable for central London The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is great  No negatives  Quiet position but close to tube station only two stops to major museums Staff friendly and efficient Room very clean and comfortable Excellent breakfast  Rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy  The location is perfect Close to the tube around the corner Great breakfast and good value  My room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling  I arrived early in the morning after a long trip from Africa I was able to take a shower and change clothes in the wellness centre which made the day fo me Perfect for 2 nights in transit between a long journey from Africa and a really long journey to NZ Quiet yet less than 5 minute walk to Piccadilly line at Earl s Court even dragging heavy suitcase  the bathrooms ar very small BUT everything you need is there They were also spotless great location very clean GREAT breakfasts nice big towels that were changed every day comfortable beds internet worked well Also a plus that the guests have access to a computer internet with a printer in the lobby  Serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems Please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies Now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always 100 coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time  Good spacious enough room and bathroom Excellent location near Earl s Court underground station Very nice breakfast buffet Very good internet facilities with printer access even Very nice garden with seating facilities No Negative My go to place when in London This was My 5th stay Great location within walking distance from Earl s Court underground station Piccadilly Line from Heathrow Staff is friendly rooms are up to date and clean  Nothing  We loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours Very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room Also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport  Above Good location Put us next to a smoking room and two of us asmathic Staff were so rude when we brought it up They eventually moved us to a new room which was a massive downgrade and one of us had to sleep on a camp bed No apology was offered  Bathroom a bit small Brilliant location Hotel comfortable and clean Staff very friendly and helpful Lovely view over London from our 5th floor room Breakfast excellent Lovely garden Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again and recommend it Very good value for money  Room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there  Great location 2 minutes from earl s court tube station nice room great shower good value for price  Breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians Great location and parking Delivered wine to celebrate my wife birthday thankyou things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking have stayed here before very comfortable good showers good breakfast  Breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive Decent selection however of food  Attended the chelsea v PSG game and opted to stay here after a great stay a few weeks ago Had a free upgrade which was a lovely surprise  Parking was handy and safe but quite expensive  The view from our room was lovely The breakfast was very tasty with plenty of choices and the easy location with the tube ride into Leicester Square just one stop away superb  The bathroom was tiny and the pillows a bit lumpy but nothing terrible  We stayed as a family to do a couple of days sightseeing Hotel was in a good area for getting around close to tube and with an underground car park Rooms comfy Good breakfast and a nice bar  Shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction Great selection at breakfast Extra comfortable beds and linen Great price through Booking com Nothing could have been better It was perfect  Never slept in such a restful bed the duvet and pillow were like sleeping in a cloud Breakfast was full of flavour with good quality produce and plenty of variety  Cooked breakfast not very imaginative Too small plates Can t cook eggs Room not as big as I hoped for in exec room king size bed Good bed Clean  The room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season The hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing That is almost a fraud The breakfast is not nearly what it used to be It was okay but not a reason to come any more The location still is a reason  Location just first class in many ways  Room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows  Breakfast is excellent Good choice and offer porridge which is always a bonus Staff recognised that we had stayed before and welcomed us back Waiting staff at breakfast were very attentive Bath towels were beautifully white and fluffy bed comfy and the room was spotless The room had a beautiful view of the gardens This is why we came back  Nothing at all Everything Great location underground around the corner We had a room on the street side and it was very quiet Fantastic breakfast friendly staff beautiful room  the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back  the breakfast was the best buffet breakfast we have had everything hot and plenty of choice it was great to have water and fruit in the room a nice touch the bedding was lovely duvet really snuggly the pull out mirror in the bathroom really useful  The bathroom is quite small but did have a tub the location the tea kettle the cosmetics quality linens Nice neighborhood attractive bar and lobby Fitness looked small but fine staff smiling Try the Blackbird Pub in front of the station to the right Wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in 2016 to dont provide proper wifi Had to work from the toilet where the signal was here Clean price is correct The only bad thing I can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small Not much space to move  Very helpful staff All premises were kept really clean A very good breakfast and you can eat all you can The garden at the bakc of the building really nice if the weather is good  Room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in London and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand The hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on Saturday Our room was not ready on time Having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one  Conscientious staff who worked hard to make our stay a pleasant one Room and hotel was clean and well presented Good location near the tube for the museums  Double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside But then this is a London old hotel  Very helpful staff great choice of food at breakfast clean and recently refurbished close to underground station  Insufficient UK power points for a couple on business without requesting UK adaptors Breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot Gym could do with an update Room was a little too compact  Great secluded garden would be fantastic in summer Very helpful and friendly staff Bed room comfortable and VERY quiet  Dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting Reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there  Very littleNo Negative Excellent base for short visits to London V good breakfast charming garden well maintained and equipped if small rooms Tube station 5 mins walk Very definitely the breakfast Fruit selection limited Very little input from staff Many 4 star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table The fried eggs were dry and inedible They clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished The outlook on to the garden was lovely  Beds very comfy The room for 3 person are not very big And another very bad surprise is with Booking Hotel i Made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused The location is very good in near the subway The staff and breakfast are excellent Bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit  Very nice staff and comfortable and quiet room Very friendly welcome and very helpful desk staff No Negative Fine hotel very clean great breakfast and nice bar Staff very helpful Access to PC and printer proper access even from iPhone Very close to tube station Highly recommended  My only thing I would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited I am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything I liked however the breakfast was lovely The room was great I couldn t ask for a better night sleep  The sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities  Staff were excellent very friendly and helpful We had a problem develop with the toilet running water and it was resolved within half hour of being reported Very efficient service in all areas  nothing The location was great on the picadilly line so very easy to get to central London and Heathrow The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable really enjoyed the stay  Thin wall can hear everything on the hallway I would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by  Great location good breakfast clean and modern hotel Some mentioned the rooms to be tiny but I thought it was a good size room for London Room got a bit cold but the heater in the room worked really well unlike some of the reviews I read Also the front desk called to check in and see if the room was alright Nice touch of customer service  Worst nights sleep in a long long time Pillows were awful gave me a bad neck Couldn t turn the heating off I barely slept due to how hot it was Bathroom was absolutely stifling No Positive First night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel Requested a fan for our room but did not receive one  Cleanliness efficiency and ease of location Comparatively quiet to other hotels I ve stayed at in London too  Front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us The scrambled eggs did not taste good at all Very buttery and watery  The breakfast buffet had a good selection  Nothing could have been better This is one of if not the best hotels I ve stayed in for it s attention to detail  This is a perfect hotel I loved the huge fluffy towels comfortable be soft pillows perfect breakfast free newspapers the staff and the free newspaper the location is superb No Negative Often the reality is different from the website but in the case of Hotel George the photos really did portray reality I could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel I chose this hotel because the average review was amazing This was spot on It s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner Just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked Who could want for more  A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in  Excellent location and very welcoming staff Great to spend a couple of nights at one of the most desirable Postcodes in the country  Rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was coldNo Positive Room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down  Amazing location great value for money Staff friendly and helpful and breakfast delicious No Negative Location was absolutely perfect just round the corner from Earl s Court Tube Station but not at all noisy Room was spacious and offered really good value for money  Bed in room 110 was appalling and needs replacement To compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means I was not the first to complain  Location and staff old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small comfortable rooms and fluffy towels and plenty of them good to have a bath after a long day very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied 350 yards to Olympia it was not Pleasant bar area food good clean bathroom Bed is too hard pillows were horrible AC didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi Wouldn t recommend it at all Location and the staff were friendly The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly  Very good location nice quiet neighbourhood Friendly staff and good breakfast  breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme  reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them  New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long Comfortable hotel in convenient location Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future  Close to underground station but in a quiet location Staff were excellent pleasant and helpful good choice for breakfast the bed was so comfortable we didn t want to get up  nothing most value for money staffs are very friendly and nice location is great actually i booked 3 hotels during this trip i think K K is most valuable absolutely will book again on next trip No Negative Quiet location nice staff especially Jose and Svietlana good breakfast what more A little bit small bathroom not a big problem for me Unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom The hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning I was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it  I stayed for one night and the hotel is beautiful in a great location Staff were very nice  Lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise Window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open  Good location nice friendly staff  The hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like IKEA The gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails The hotel is clean in good location the breakfast wasn t bad The room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat  The staff were very obliging and provided a good service Restaurant looks out onto a well kept garden which would be lovely in summer  Rooms could have been a bit bigger Design and decor dated  All clean and well maintained Staff excellent Ideal location for our visit to the Albrt Hall  nothing Very close to underground Very close to shops and restaurants Quiet location Very nice modern hotel even with a garden Breakfast was very goodNo Negative Very comfortable double room excellent breakfast very courteous and helpful staff very close to the Tube many good restaurants in the area walking distance  Nothing really important Good breakfast Free wi fi Good bar Lovely room with a nice view to the hotel s garden Great bathroom with a very good shower Excellent locationNo Negative Easy to get to from the tube station Staff friendly Room was clean The location was quiet Hotel was well presented Good bars and restuarants within walking distance  Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable  Good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station Friendly hotel staff Clean room and bathroom with nice big shower No Negative A boutique style hotel It had a lovely garden Nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use Complimentary fresh fruit plate for us The breakfast was superb Gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates Quiet location but within minutes of bustle  a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light  very nice staff at the front desk  This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy  Near Earl s Court metrostation really easy to reach Staff was very friendly No Negative Very good continental breakfast excellent location close to earls court tube station The K and K has a very good value and totally refurbished I really recommend it  The room was small and very warm even with air conditioning It was situated beside the lift even though I requested a quiet room The bathroom was even smaller  The hotel is located only a 2 minute walk from Earls Court tube and situated on a quiet street Staff are welcoming friendly and knowledgeable The hotel and room was spotless Breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of both continental and English  Room a little on the small side though perfect for one person Food in room service could have been a little more interesting Good coffee though  Excellent location helpful staff Comfortable room Heated bathroom floor and lovely towels nice and big  room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast  style breakfast bar meals great staff  Small rooms  Perfect Location Great value Very comfortable beds We arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great Nice lobby Right next to Earls Court Tube stop so plenty of travel links Tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area  English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice  Lovely hotel with friendly staff Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating We had a room overlooking the garden which was nice Excellent location Would definitely stay here again  The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January  The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good  Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels  Great location really near to Earls Court tube station and restaurants Friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds Nice hotel with modern touches Definitely stay again No Negative Very convenient location for Earl s Court Tube station Warm welcome from reception staff Good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon  I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home  Location Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again  The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen  The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price  Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger  Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London  See above tangent  Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away  I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again No Positive We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor No Positive Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers Hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride  Staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean  1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm  Bar area and Reception goodNo Negative We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself  On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show  On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal No Negative I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court  The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny  Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated  Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good  Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed  Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained  Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower  Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess Excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall  Location staff and cleanliness  Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London  Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel  The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant  Good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom Excellent choice of food at breakfast The bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire  One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful  2 minutes from Earl s Court tube Hotel has everything you would want in London Good breakfast comfortable room free wifi that works  We had no ventilation in bathroom The location is superb close to Central and all shopping areas as well as restaurants Our room was good size very comfy Excellent breakfast with big variety vegetarian and vegan options and bubbly  The beds Quite small room We asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room It was hidden in the cupboard  The location the view from room 221 Nice breakfast room with excellent breakfast and a nice view to the garden Coffee and tea in room  Nothing  The hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of Earls Court Very friendly staff Delicious breakfast  we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely been before had a very good stay Small rooms but very tidy Room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours  Well connected and quite location Great breakfast service and stuff  Room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot Location excellent tube is close by so travel is easy Breakfast excellent Staff friendly Rooms spotless bed was so soft and comfy Nothing It s perfect  Excellent location 2 minutes to Earl s Court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from  The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor  The place is nice and the breakfast is very good It was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room  No bad experiences at all There was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel Our room was very comfortable and a good size for a London hotel It was clean tidy and well equipped The staff were first class They were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot The breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality We will certainly pay a return visit No Negative Beautiful hotel great location friendly helpful staff good breakfast included in the price LOVED the help yourself Nescafe in the lobby while waiting for breakfast Thank you  Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money  Location for us was important Main public areas high standard and parking a bonus Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent  Great location great amenities transport links Rooms had all key requirements Staff helpful Nothing The bath was huge and the location was really good near the tube but outside the congestion zone with a good car parkNo Negative The location is great you can find all what you need int that area close to the u derground The hotel is nice clean with a friendly staff  Keys for the rooms and system of opening doors Water in the shower kept changing temperatures constantly Location size of room and comfort of bed The breads at breakfast were not as fresh as I thought they should be Having said that the range of choice was excellentNo Positive I ordered aroom on the second or third floor and got on the ground also orderd an executive room and got standard No Positive The bathroom was extremely small  The room was lovely clean and the beds were very comfortable It was also great to have the garden  Difficult to find anything that we didn t like  The location the outlook of the hotel Friendliness of the staff we will returnNo Negative Very clean comfy hotel Good value at 99 a night in London Great location for Earls Court Royal Albert Hall and tube  Thin walls could hear the TV next door quite loudly but not enough to complain Location was excellent as we re the staff We ordered a room for 3 adults The room was a 2 person room with a horribel extra bed Not made for adults and caused painful nights No Positive Expense for meals  The location and the easy travelling to where we needed to be as we were in London for a purpose not a holiday  The staircase at the entrance inconvenience for the huge luggage n not suitable for elderly  The breakfast is thumbs up with its variety n quality No Negative The staff were efficient and friendly and the room was clean I chose the hotel based on its cleanliness rating and wasn t disappointed  Upgraded to executive king size room not an executive room in my opinion Very basic Appears to be more suited to business clients  Great location Loved it all  We enjoyed the little extras eg tissue box set in marble under the sink Washing line discreetly fixed over bath etc Breakfast not quite as good as it used to be It used to be what set this hotel apart from its competitors  Good attentive staff During previous stays it was nice to have a glass of champagne from the breakfast buffet We missed it this time  Good location and private parking wifi is as always in london bit of pain due to lower and unstable bitrate excellent staff and great welcome to the hotel after checkinNo Negative the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood very close to the earl s court tube station great breakfast very nice staff clean and comfotableNo Negative The K K hotel is always maintained and staffed to a high standard We ve been going back there for many years now and always enjoy our stay No Negative All the staff where very friendly and helpful The food was excellent and a great choice The rooms where lovely as well No Negative Nice hotel with a wonderful backyard Good location as it is close to subway In a residential area Restaurants close by  the matress is not very comfortable and the bathroom is small even I had a king executive room position of the hotel wifi and breakfastNo Negative Responsive staff excellent room terrific breakfast and located conveniently to tube A bit pricey but service food and comfort all exceptional  Difficult to locate the phone to contact reception lack toilet itineraries and it was difficult to locate these  They have followed through special requests Comfortable bed wide choices for breakfast and very clean  Air con not great  Great location and very comfortable rooms Room was available for early check in Easy walk to attractions and trains for onward journey  Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal  We had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food  Standard rooms are very comfortable Good central location No Negative Very large room Hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful Short walk to public transport Blackfriars Tube Station and Temple Station  We have been charged for room service that we did not have I spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of 43 53 issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed This has not been done  Location and room excellent It would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station Customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel  Guest svc manager Francesco was very helpful with our questions on places to go and ways to get there Room bed was extremely comfortable and good sized Bathroom was also a good sized bathroom with a long bath and a cute Apex duck a very cute and novel idea  Every thing was excellent Apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at 9 am by staff walking in room When I mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered  Room was great Bathroom was immaculately clean No problems at all  Room and bathroom excellent Really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower TV ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room Hotel looks new so all furnishings modern Tube a short walk away We walked to the Theatre district in around 15 20 minutes We did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by I would certainly recommend this hotel No Negative Staff really friendly bed was extremely comfy and not too far from two underground stations The concierge recommended a great italian on fleet street and booked a table for two in minutes Overall great stay No Negative we were very pleased with the Hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the Standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors  Not a lot to put in this section If I was going to be very picky I d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad Wine list could be improved  Room was clean and well appointed Location was great for sight seeing Being set back from the road our room was quiet A most enjoyable stay  Meals very plain No extras or garnishes Restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable Cold croissants for breakfast  Nice room Modern and cool Bar space in lobby very cosy  No toothbrush provided Being new in this area the conceierge service is excellent Special thanks to Mr Francis who was on duty and helped my colleague and myself several times throughout our stay  Nothing Brilliant location so close to the tube Room was GORGEOUS and spacious lovely and modern The hotel was quiet and so so clean Loved it Really made our stay extra relaxing  The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while  Nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area  The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi  The location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the Underground Tube We also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district There were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice The staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly They also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them  The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows  We were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite As part of that you get access to the Club Lounge The room was lovely Looked as new comfy bed very clean And the Club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available 24hrs  The staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation The view from the hotel was quite uninspiring  Easy to reach Covent Garden Soho and City However the hotel is quite far away from Westminster Room is clean comfy and nicely designed Very nice couch good bathNo Negative Book a room that comes with access to the Club Lounge The Club Lounge offers a continental breakfast free water soda wine and beer throughout the day and sandwiches and fruit during the afternoon The coffee machine makes the best lattes along with a variety of other types of coffees and hot chocolate This lounge really made the stay for us  Breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary A la carte was also possible but we didn t try  Although it s a fairly big hotel the overall vibe we got was very cozy which we liked a lot Staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we needed Upon arrival we received a reduction coupon for the breakfast The location is exquisite  More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets  Very clean large rooms with high value toiletries Extremely comfortable bed and pillows Friendly staff No Negative This is without question one of London finest Hotels I have never slept that well in a very very longtime and I love the duck Amazing reception and great facilities No Negative Great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody  The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft  The hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic The room and bed were extremely comfortable Excellent personalised service Food was excellent  This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time No Positive Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building The design facilities and location of the hotel WIFI and also Gym were quite convenient Some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too  Staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday Room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar Room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed Very clean and lovely bathroom too  A few more little milks maybe as I drink a lot of tea but I was given a little jug of milk when I asked  The bathroom was light pleasant and very clean The wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities The bed was comfortable  The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels  The room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious  Nothing your doing a fantastic job Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again  The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better  It was located in a cosy corner off the street  If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything  The staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction  Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment  At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel  Beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent  We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay  The location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket  The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view  The staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly The shower and bath were fantastic  Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them  Staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm Good location to walk around London  Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector  Nice bathroom with big shower and bath Quiet if you get a room on the top floors No Negative I spend the weekend in the Apex Hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from Apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london For this THANK YOU SO MUCH We will come back Best regards Theresa Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street  Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud  Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed  Comfortable room which was very clean My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison No Positive Everything was genuinely perfect  Everything from the reception greeting of Luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception The cleaning staff were polite and warm My standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room  Nothing Our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our Green Band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors Very comfortable and clean room Balcony was a little plus  Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code  Alex Hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was amazing Free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh  It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room  Hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex hotel  its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet location would have been great The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this  Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing No Negative The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries  Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast  Location of the hotelNo Negative Really lovely and luxurious hotel Special thanks to Gosia on Reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you Gosia  A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans  The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable  Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side  Excellent location good standard of hotel Professional service Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked No Positive The ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but I am aware I m fussy with my baths  Location was reason for booking and was spot on Staff were all very pleasant Time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast Room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains Check out swift and easy No Negative Location of the hotel is fantastic The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful The room was massive particularly considering its location in London The breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around London  A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room  Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location  Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay  Given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience  We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted  Room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need Bed was very comfortable as well The surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road 1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced  The bed really confortable Location is good walking distance to tube and train  Can t think of anything that could have been improved  Room was gorgeous and very clean Lovely big bed High quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus  The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating Pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go  Location and price so close to Christmas was awesome room upgrade on arrival was much appreciated after a long and difficult flight Staff very welcoming and attentive helped us with our bags and shopping when we checked in and out were on hand to order taxis and help It was also quiet and out of the way despite the central location  Sorry can t think of any negative thing  It is tucked away but near to public transport The staff were friendly efficient and helpful Their restaurant had a great selection at reasonable prices Beds comfortable very clean and we had a lovely walk in shower  How hasn t this place got a extra star It should be five star not four  What didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful We loved everything at the Apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly The food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room The nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages And the Elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch Elemis is a amazing brand to use  Really we could find fault with nothing  The location so close to the centre but beautifully quiet The efficiency of the whole operation including breakfast which is often the weak link in hotels The stylish decor within an old style exterior  The basin doesn t seem to be clean enough It s difficult to drain waters down the basin Location Close to city center Big Ben and river Thames 5 minutes walk to Temple station Bed is comfortable The shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty  The location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite The staff was more than helpful  Could have had a few more different tea bags in room  Room and bathroom very clean room quite spaciious for London comfortable king size bed in a quiet square away from the noise of traffic nice to have tea making facilities in room  As always the price of breakfast is far too expensive There are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices  The location of the hotel is perfect It s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to Temple or Blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield The superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking There are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa The room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep The staff are very attentive polite and helpful  We heard our neighbors bathroom in the night We arived the hotel late in the night and the staff service was exelent without extra charge upgraded our room The ducks idea is unique and fun IN the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk I didn t know what happened The air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature  The room is spacious and clean Amenities are all prepared which is very helpful The staff are very kind  Hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help  Clean comfy and a great location for us No Negative Location was very central but rooms very quiet Reception very friendly efficient and helpful bags were taken to rooms discounted breakfast offered in addition to room only we had booked facilities described map of London given and named member of staff provided as contact during our stay Over the weekend bar staff and housekeeping staff were equally good Excellent personal service our best hotel stay in London for a decade  All is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower Likewise bedroom was not clean  Nothing I do not recommend this hotel to tourists The manager does not care about you and they do not try to deal with your problems  We didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away  Very quiet location considering so close to Fleet Street comfortable bed  The rooms and corridors were much to hot however I was able to lower the temperature in the room There is absolutely nothing else to complain about A lovely hotel I liked the green elephant outside The condition of the room after it was cleaned was exceptional The bathroom was stunning Having a free bottle of still and sparkling water every day was brilliant There was an ironing board kettle hairdryer safe fridge Free wifi I was very comfortable the whole stay It was also very quiet Food in the restaurant was 5 star There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup  Love Elemis toiletries modern bathroom and clean Liked that the shower was separate to the bath Beds comfy Overall very pleased  Unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available I did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free  Room and comfy bed Wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok Very dark and quiet room perfect for sleep Big and nice bathroom  I realise that good accommodation is expensive in central London but neverthelessI feel this hotel is somewhat costly We were on a room only rate so I cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel  The location is unbeatable both from the point of view of access to all the sites and attractions of central London but also the area where the hotel is located is very attractive The hotel is quite The staff were very friendly facilities in the bedroom and bathroom were first class  Just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day Maybe need to book very early to get a good deal  Great sized room and bathroom with separate bath Very comfortable bed and nice touch of some free jelly beans  We didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered Service was very slow one hour and a Half for 1 burger 1 risotto and 2 pies  Room was excellent bed very comfy and quiet staff were great especially Leandro who was working in the bar on sa I can t think of anything that could have been improved  Staff were extremely friendly and efficient I mentioned that we were taking the trip to celebrate my husband s birthday so staff arranged for chocolates to be left in the room which was a lovely surprise Breakfast really good too  All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping  The location of the hotel is great Room and bed were comfortable and clean We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time however we were able to get an early check in with no problems Would definitely stay there again  The food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available We had to venture out to eat instead  Stylish hotel in a great location for exploring London Rooms very well appointed and comfortable Really enjoyed our stay here  Several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips  Enjoyed use of club lounge perfect for continental breakfast Hotel not too big Situation great for visiting many tourist sights Would stay again  The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else  The bed was extremely comfortably And the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it No Negative They were more than accommodating with allowing early check in and complementary late check out Would really recommend the Apex group of hotels for your business or leisure travels  really couldn t fault it  A lovely luxury yet highly friendly hotel that will put a big smile on your face as soon as you walk past the elephant  We brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated  Lovely room and access to the club lounge was great No Negative Great location with easy access to the underground Fabulous breakfast with hot foods selections Comfy and cozy bed All staff were very welcoming as always  Room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty My in room breakfast pancakes went so hard I couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot  Location was great we walked there from Victoria and very close to Covent Garden decor quite lovely beds and pillows very comfy showers spacious baths deep good amount of storage and in room facilities In room breakfast was promptly delivered and beautifully presented  Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive  Location and staff were excellent arrived early and was aloud to check in with no problems  While some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g Jesus Other staff were just rude to the level that I will not recommend this hotel to any of my network  Great location Very clean and comfortable No Negative The busstop at Fleetstreet one step away from the hotel Furthermore a lot of restaurants and theatres at walking distance The hotel is nice modern clean and quiet  We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky Room was spacious as was the bathroom with lovely complimentary toiletries Beds were extremely comfy Check in and out was a breeze and staff were attentive Great cocktails in the bar All good  The room was good size very clean and comfortable Good menu at reasonable prices Best to get room with club access for a little more money as you will save this on breakfast alone  I didn t understand the continental breakfast setup My room didn t include breakfast A weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing 18 pounds No Positive No full length mirror in bedrooms Breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking Really great reception staff Fantastic suzed rooms amazing location great food  Being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror  The bed was really comfortable We had a quiet room with dual aspect windows and a lovely view of the London Eye and The Shard The bathroom with separate shower and bath tub The helpful attitude of staff  Room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to 19 degrees  Very nice hotel immaculate Excellent location Good size room Would definitely stay again  I bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the 8 service charge They were not happy when I queried it and asked for the money back Light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced Good sized rooms and well fitted out Very helpful Concierge and Reception desk staff Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them  Excellent bedding mattress and pillows Room large and very quiet in the upper floors as requested Staff extremely service minded and helpful Wonderful location we took the tube from St Pancras Int l to Temple when arriving However we discovered afterwards that the double decker bus 23 stops a few meters from the hotel and goes to the Strand Trafalgar Piccadilly Oxford Circus etc i e ideal for shopping theatres and activities It was also very easy to go back to St Pancras walking north on Fetter Lane to Holborn then taking bus 45 to King s Cross next to St Pancras Int l No Negative We were given a complimentary upgrade to the top floor by a very friendly lady who checked us in All the staff we encountered were courteous welcoming I would definitely stay here again Also a perfect location  In an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a 10 minute walk away  The hotel was luxurious with large comfortable beds and good pillows As it was away from the main tourist areas it was quiet at night so good for sleeping The breakfast was varied and very tasty with the hot breakfast made to order from the menu It was possible to walk into Covent Garden within 10 15 minutes which meant many attractions and restaurants were easily reachable An excellent base for a good week stay with interconnecting rooms for the family  We were put in a disabled room so no bath  As we were up for a function in Middle Temple Hall location could not have been better Very comfortable room and very obliging staffNo Negative An excellent location for London sights and theatre district The staff were very friendly and accommodating Super breakfast and a well stocked bar  Check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly Double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and I will have to have room with two singles Disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone AC unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally Bose docking station only suitable for iPhone 4 do those still exist There was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat At this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience No Positive My room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work Would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds  Great location good size room for London with very friendly and helpful staff  the heating was turned to 25 degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm  I left a jacket and suit bag behind and Francesco was super helpful in tracking it down Great bathroom and good pillows  there was no bubble bath over all the satyr was great the staff were most help full bed was comfy bath was Hugh took care of my every need and made myself and my partner most welcome Room facing a wall  This hotel is located on the western edge of the City in the walking distance from all the West end attractions in a quiet courtyard next to the Temple Inn of court The room was spacious and well equipped  I was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description The view offices 5 meter from my window The price of room service The location The friendly staff The comfort and cleanliness of the room The bathroom The hotel s design The inner court and the lovely bar area Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump The bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and I also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon I passed this view on to the chef because I think in England were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often The whole room was nicely decorated  Nothing  The appearance of the hotel was beautiful and every single member of staff was delightful Hotel bar was very relaxing and our room size was perfect  Was difficult to see from afar where hotel is Had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place  The hotel was lush Beds were extremely comfy Very clean too Staff were great always willing to help  In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault  The hotel was a 5 minute walk from Blackfriars station Beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance On arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade Rooms were fantastic with everything you need Ideal for our romantic weekend away Bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs They had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in London without our case having to come with us Also a 10 minute walk from Covent Garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t No Negative Staffs are very kind and friendly I ve stayed at Apex before When I checked in a staff told me Welcome back I was really happy for such a friendly atmosphere Thank you so much  room isn t as photo shows in booking We booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size 30m2 with sofa We were given a room on 4 floor the room was small abt 20 23m2 only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown Where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space  Room is very clean good facilities  One staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo ID was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day  Great location comfortable clean room with all facilities we needed Staff generally helpful  The AC couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down About 1 3 of the TV channels didn t work due to weak signal Only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms There are other lifts but they re staff only  Great location The rooms and bathrooms are very well laid out with plenty of storage Elemis products shampoo conditioner bath gel and lotion Lovely coffee and tea service includes milk chocolate and different types of sugar Plenty of outlets Clever desk vanity set up is a perfect area to dry hair makeup The bench at the end of the bed is also very handy  Nothing The hotel is well located and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable What makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff They are so helpful and very attentive I cannot speak highly enough of the staff They help to make it a great hotel in London No Negative Our room was lovely and modern with everything you could need The Club Lounge was a lovely peaceful space to have breakfast in and then later relax in and have a refreshment after a busy day sightseeing  There really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel  I couldn t fault this hotel it more than met my expectations in the d cor size of room position and helpfulness of staff  Regular customer of Apex City of London hotel They didn t know I was a returning customer upon arrival Breakfast should have been included for over 300 for a room  Super comfy bed Beautiful courtyard towards the rear  The room that I was given is smaller than what was shown when I reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one The room view was to corporate offices so I couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode  Good location and decent style and atmosphere No Negative The hotel is well located in the legal district of London and within walking distance of major city landmarks such as St Paul s Cathedral theatres and Trafalgar Square Staff were friendly and helpful  The room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature  Reception staff were excellent Gym was well equipped for the size  The restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free Hotel is in a good position although tucked away from the main road Our room was very clean and the bed comfortable The iron and ironing board came in handy as we were going to a weddingNo Negative Loved the courtyard nice place to unwind after sightseeing Lots of attention to comfort and details in our room towel warmer wash cloths usb ports lovely bedding cute rubber duckie cozy and comfortable public areas No Negative Wonderful pillows Seriously it s been over 10 years since my last trip to London My impression is that London has become a more friendly city and this extends to all the staff at Apex Temple who were courteous and helpful to us  Staff wasn t super friendly Doorman was impatient and bordering on rude  Modern and well appointed Nice shower Bathrobes slippers in room ironing board and adapters if you forget one  No decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room  Friendly and helpful staff Location in easy walking distance of theatres shops and river Hotel was quiet although on a busy street  Seemed very matter of fact at Reception Lacked warmth Didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine  Beautiful Elemis bath products supplied  Location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep  Really comfortable rooms nice friendly staff Lovely courtyard to have drinks etc  Oddly I was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile  Great value excellent location and a good breakfast Nothing We loved the style and comfort of our room and of the hotel in general It s location was perfect right in the heart of the city with all its hustle and bustle yet very restful and quiet The staff were excellent and the service superb  Nothing  Location was great walking distance to lots of attractions Hotel itself was immaculate comfy beds spotless bathroom with Elemis toiletries Couldn t fault anything  It was an excellent hotel all round Nothing to complain about  The rooms were very comfortable with beautiful modern decor great lighting robes iron drinks and a cracking bed The hotel is set back slightly from Fleet St in its own courtyard and it has a modern bar and a well appointed gym The staff were excellent as was the breakfast  We had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit  Have stayed here before and love this hotel for the location It s a15min taxi from St Pancras close to Trafalgar Sq Somerset House the river Tate Modern St Paul s the oldest pub in London many theatres The rooms are very well appointed and the friendly courteous staff make this a special place to stay There is also a very nice tapas bar next door  The noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed The nice rooms tv fast wireless the great bathroom Breakfast was chaotic Slow and had to keep on asking for missing items Definitely the B team on that day Was better in previous stay  Very well appointed hotel with friendly efficient reception staff Overall good experience Set back off Fleet Street so no traffic noise  The really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening  Lovely hotel with super clean rooms efficient staff and all that you may need for a comfortable and pleasant stay The room was of a fair size with comfortable bed the only drawback was no possibility of opening the window but this is a minor thing as most people prefer the air conditioning anyway Overall a great place  Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day  Staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck  Enjoyed it all  Fabulous bed and bathroom extra big great for getting ready for an occasion It was like a little oasis of quiet set away from all the noise Will stay again  Only 1 small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks Pringles and jelly beans during our 4 night stay  Excellent location beds very comfy breakfast good When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months  The hotel is great The staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that I will visit the hotel again The room superior double 5th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard Considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops Very clean good sleep And I liked it aesthetically It has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel I would definitely recommend it  None Breakfast really gave a good start of the day Also the rooms were clean and the beds were super comfy This hotel is stroll recommend for people who d like to stay in a quite and relaxing atmosphere and still be in the heart of everything  Staff in reception not helpful nore friendly Besides we had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar Poor service compared to the hotel ranking excellent location great bedroom especially the bed Nothing to improve wish I could ve stayed longer  The room was really large by London standards well planned out great modern decor a balcony to sit outside on Nespresso machine Elemis toiletries friendly helpful staff very clean good location right on Fleet St Would stay again We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading  We were mother and daughter away for a few days in London The room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring  Nothing The Apex Temple court Hotel is a beautiful facility that is very well located in central London You are a few minutes walk from major destinations The staff is extremely friendly very helpful and very knowldegeable Rooms are outstanding and the wifi is goodnall throughout the facility I definitely recommend the stay there for both business and leisure  The coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context  This hotel offers a great value in a good location The staff was marvelous and helpful to a fault No Negative On arrival the receptionist was extremely helpful she gave us a map advised us on the quickest way to get to our destination and as we were leaving she called us a taxi The bar staff were very friendly to Overall lovely stay  Staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception I also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room I spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number Once I called reception they said they would called in house service but I still didn t receive the cup Perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty P Also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work Not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance In summary great stay and I would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way  Rooms were clean and beautiful and loved the bathroom with the free standing bath area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only 10 15 mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception  very modern comfy rooms very clean lovely staff good wifi ok location good breakfast not included with room price  Located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants Limited view Friendly staff willing to help Modern rooms and very comfortable Close to some old historic pubs frequented by locals rather than tourists  Can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything The friendly knowledgable staff couldn t do enough for us they made us feel so very welcome The room was excellent from the facilities to the cleanliness and the bed was fantastic  Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything  Beautiful hotel Everything was very clean bed was VERY comfortable Drinks at the bar were great and staff there was pleasant No Negative Excellent bedroom very large by London standards overlooking the courtyard Pleasant staff good location for all the sights you can walk to St Pauls and the Thames quite easily Nice area at night for atmospheric old style Fleet Street pubs  Can t find fault with anything loved it  Everything room with balcony was fantastic very helpful staff central for everything Concierge was so helpful when we realised we had left clothing behind it was posted the very next da Highly recommend this hotel it s fantastic Room was not ready for us to check in The front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal No sense of personal individualised service  comfortable bed good location lovely housekeeping staff  Access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events Understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience Amazing service great staff The rooms were great and all of my requests were met and exceeded Deco is beautiful and location extremely convenient I appreciated the peace and quiet of the location Accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in 6 days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in I had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude Spacious rooms Housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain  The staff very friendly yet professional Just a really good hotel And don t forget the duck  Milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us Staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two Not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu  Very comfortable bed quiet room as requested polite and efficient staff  As above Croissants not flakey enough Dining room chairs need tips v noisy when moved Bed lovely Quietness great All staff v pleasant and helpful Two adjacent rooms were requested Upon arrival only one was ready  Comfortable and modern hotel Rooms were quiet with large bathroom Friendly staff  Room looked over by office block Strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room Staff gave us another room without hesitation Beds so comfortable and clean Staff very helpful Location for me but it is still very central  Hotels in London are always very low quality This one really manages to come in a different higher standard No Negative great staff my arrival was very delayed they were waiting and ready for me at 3am with an upgraded room Ideal location close to covent garden underground etc  A bit mean with tea coffee milk etc The only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening  Very nice hotel in a convenient fairly quiet for London location Staff were friendly rooms were a good size comfortable clean  Nothing The bed and pillows were so comfy I could have taken them home Everything was great and especially as it had not been recommended and just picked out of a few looked at on line We were just so pleased and would definitely return  Bar and food prices but then it is London and the whole City is a rip off  Close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good Although on Fleet Street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise The bed was probably the best I have ever slept in No Negative Lovely hotel fantastic location for us Excellent customer service at reception I had forgotten to print off concert tickets lovely receptionist went out of her way to help me print them It would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff  The very helpful and friendly staff especially Cesar in the restaurant and Wilfredo always cheerful and ready to help in any way First class facilities and decor You even had good weather for us Very considerate Please email our invoice Thanks  The lighting was pretty dark Room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp  Everything was amazing we were very happy and pleased and would definitely go back again Also we arrived at 12 34am due to delayed flights all day and the Apex staff at the concierge gave us a later check out time  Entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps As it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps  Room was well equipped and comfortable decor was modern and attractive Location on Fleet Street near theatreland is good  They gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected View on a wracked street corner so I felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price No Positive Details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out  Room was quiet and comfortable nice to have iPod speakers  Nothing could be better everything was excellent Beautiful building very friendly staff and the elephant was lovely room was very nice bed so comfortable and big decor very niceNo Negative Everything was perfect and more rooms very good quality fittings beautiful comfortable beds and pillows Friendly staff nothing was too much trouble excellent choice of breckfast  Skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray No opening window Bit pricey compared with other similar London stays  Large comfy bed Large walk in shower Huge mirror Nothing at all The room was lovely Extremely spacious and with a balcony The club lounge was a great touch Well stocked with food and drinks All the staff were very helpful and keen to make sure everything was to our liking We had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working  Excellent location Beautiful hotel Great breakfast No Negative We loved everything about staying at Apex Temple Court hotel The staff was nice perfect located The room was big bright and clean Bed and pillows very comfortable and furnishing were modern The Club lounge was the best We will definitely stay there next time we go to London  Nothing to complain about here  Rooms are spacious and a large bathroom with separate full size bath and shower area added to the overall relaxation experience  Cannot think of anything All the staff To a man woman they were polite and helpful to such an extent that I telephoned the General Manager on my return home to congratulate him on the quality of his people The food was good too  My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI No Positive The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated  I did not like very much The location was good There was a good shower That is about it No Negative Room was lovely Spacious and luxurious Excellent bathroom One of the comfiest beds we ve slept in Location is quiet and yet so convenient We walked to Drury Lane very easily and quickly And it s on a bus route from Paddington so we had a leisurely scenic journey back to our train  Kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry Try Loch Fyne kippers Best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard  Reception staff incredibly attentive helpful and approachable Only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in London not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day I had to work  I loved the pillows and the bed was super comfortable Where can I buy those pillows The new interiors were Bar prices but that s London for you  I have been stopping here on and off for the past couple of years Faultless and extremely pleasant stay Within easy reach of all the main tourist hot spots Would definitely recommend if on a weekend break No Negative very clean rooms nice location entrance is on the main street and the bus station is just 5meters away bus no 23 takes you to Picadilly circus and Oxford circus very nice lobby good mojito rooms are cozy modern and quiet robes and slippers are included we didn t have breakfast included in our price as we wanted to eat out all the time but the food in the lobby along with our drinks was great  Can t really think of anything Location is great for Covent Garden and central London Very friendly and helpful staff Room was extremely clean and comfortable For where it is its great value There was even a charger lead in the room for my fone No Negative From arrival staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was excellent Our room was first class spacious well appointed and with a good view  For 3 days straight I found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag The room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services  Location is great Close to the City and you can take bus to everywhere as the bus stop is very close to the hotel  Laundry dry cleaning rates Whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high  Well trained knowledgeable approachable and friendly staff  Nothing From the moment we arrived and checked in early the staff were great The room was fantastic with a great view of the London Eye and Big Ben Sky sports in the room is always a massive plus being an avid golfer  The breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for 2 people for under the cost of 1 person at the hotel The location was perfect we stayed on a Saturday and it was quiet but lovely The rooms were big lovely walk in shower clean no noise from other rooms staff all very friendly and helpful Too little wardrobe space No chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers Lighting in the bathroom could have been better No where to put toiletries in the shower Breakfast was very good with a great choice The bed was so good we didn t want to get up Location superb for both the City and the West End Staff were very friendly and accommodating  Absolutely nothing Staff always had time for us and when they printed out tickets for the Tower of London for us gave us great advice to visit the Crown Jewels straight away as the queues build up later This proved to be the case  Expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage Great connection to public transport polite service Did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities  Considerate helpful and friendly staff Lovely room value for money Apex the duck gift in bathroom No Negative Had amazing service free upgrade and when my husbands flight delay nearly interfered with our trip they allowed an early check for free and tried their best help Faultless service  No FOX news or CNBC on TV these are important channels for US visitors Big selection of international channels from other countries Wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience Great staff Love the location  There was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast This is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all  Amazing hotel excellently appointed great location quiet comfortable rooms and very good value for money compared to similar price points Black pudding on the breakfast was delicious  The breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there  We went for my husband s 40th birthday The manager kindly arranged for a complimentary birthday card and beautifully wrapped box of chocolates to be left in the room For a fee they sprinkled rose petals from the door to the bed where they put the petals in the shape of a heart There were more around the bath too A lovely extra touch We were given a free upgrade too without even asking The staff couldn t do enough to help They even gave us a second free duck as we said we had two children The room was really clean and modern bed extra comfy shower fantastic The details of Elemis toiletries and free jelly beans and Pringles were an excellent bonus I cannot fault it and would definitely stay again Location is excellent Close to Blackfriars tube station Excellent excellent excellent No Negative Quiet yet very handy location for a number of London theatres including the Savoy Although we didn t use the bar it looked very inviting with the option to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine  We asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so I called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away 2 weeks later still nothing at all I think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill  The bed was comfy and the bath tube so nice  I sleep warm and I couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor  Large room for London for sure And it s well located in the city The staff was attentive  All good  Room was very comfortable and well appointed Attention to detail was obvious Customer service in all areas was excellent Location was central to city attractions and entertainment  There wasn t anything we didn t like  The location is amazing rooms are spacious have everything you d need Both rooms and public spaces are clean stylish I stayed on a Sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week  Excellent staff high quality room and furnishings and a good breakfast  I couldn t fault it at all Lovely clean hotel in a great location Staff were very friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we had the best possible stay The room was immaculate and well equipped  There was nothing to fault  The generously sized bathroom had a lovely bath and separate big shower cubicle Everything was high quality and the room beautifully appointed Very comfortable bed and large Not at all noisy considering the location even with the window open Plenty of eating places nearby and easy to find on foot No Negative Absolutely brilliant hotel Me and my fiancee booked 2 nights stay for our anniversary to watch lion king We were upgraded as soon as we arrived Great hotel tucked away would 100 recommend to anyone  The ONLY down point I have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high I understand the weekend we visited London was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures  The room was refreshed everyday from check in to check out the hotel staff were constantly professional and always helpful Nothing seemed too much to ask  I found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great  Everything was amazing the decoration the room the bed the staff We are very happy to have found this hotel and we will recommend it to all of our friends  Limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening  Lovely room and good food Service and staff excellent Breakfast was lovely and waiting time at reception short Benefits of a smaller and more intimate hotel  Nothing everything was spot on  I stayed here with my daughter for a Bank Holiday treat Excellent service from all staff and delicious food served in the room after a long day out and about Very good location for theatres and Covent Garden Faultless Our second visit to this hotel We wouldn t stay anywhere else in London  Breakfast was very expensive Location is good about 8 mins walk to the tube but also close to St Pauls Cathedral and the river Room was very clean and the bathrooms was very nice  Am struggling to think of any negatives In fact I cannot think of any at all  The room was of excellent quality and the bed was so comfortable I could stay there again for this reason alone WiFi being free and of good quality was important for someone like myself roaming with my mobile network Staff were extremely friendly and professional I would recommend this hotel to everyone possible  Bar prices a little steep  Excellent rooms and it is either a new hotel or recently refurbished We only had the basic room which was very comfortable with a very good en suite Great location only 10 mins walk to Trafalgar Square Lunch was very good but only ate at hotel once Staff very helpful and pleasant Lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel which was lovely in the Spring sunshine You would not have known that it is located in the centre of London Good gym as well which I didn t use Tube station only 5 minutes walk away and hotel surrounded by good restaurants and bars  Breakfast prices might be reduced Location Fleet Street Central Great staff Perfect for sights Theatre Room facilities Gowns Coffee Iron Satellite TV Bath and Shower Comfortable Bed Quiet When staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the Club Lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade I thought this was a bit mean spirited Also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room chocolates in the room and a free drink at the bar Lovely welcome touch The location is superb None The location was so convenient and it s quite We were upgraded to a lovely clean spacious room with a very comfy bed and pillows The staff were all friendly and professional from the reception Raquel and Clara concierge Wilfredo and restaurant staff especially Lina We can highly recommend Apex Temple hotel  The wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain It wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure Whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night  We paid for an upgrade to our room and liked it very much The bed was comfortable the room well appointed and most of all it was lovely and quiet The hotel was fine though we did little in it except sleep and have breakfast The latter was fine The location of the hotel is convenient for Fleet St and neighbouring areas No Negative Everything you need to make a short break easy a decent hair dryer an iron that gets hot and you don t have to wait an hour for the bath to fill simple things that many London hotels still cannot provide in 2016 Cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in and very comfortable Almost 5 star  Nothing  Great location Check in staff and concierge were so polite and helpful we felt nothing was too much trouble and very genuine The room was spotless and facilities excellent A very quiet room and bed was extremely comfortable which meant we slept very well  Wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all  Relaxing ambience quiet location great breakfast Excellent service from all of the staff  No complaints The whole stay at this hotel was more than perfect Location close to the bus station n front of the main entrance in fact and metro 5 7 min of walk Personnel Helpful kind quick reacting to the complaints Clean proper rooms In the room there is complimentary cookies tea coffee Someone was complaining of not enough of milk I don t think that people should expect a bottle of milk for free in a room It s ridiculous Especially if you will mention on a reception or to passing made that you would like to have a little more of mono dose milk they would kindly give it to you Wi fi is good bed is large and super comfortable conditioner in the room bath and shower in a bathroom And super cute duck  bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper  upgraded when we arrived to a lovely spacious room overlooking the square Reception staff were plentiful and well informed  Was approx 10 minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between Temple and Black Friars stations Could just be me being lazy though  Room was lovely view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms One had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else  very clean helpful and polite staff Nice rooms generally N A Hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff Had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a Saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all We were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely Loved the Apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website No Negative The Superior Room was very comfortable The location of the hotel along Fleet Street was a comfortable walking distance to Covent Garden If you chose not to walk there are buses just outside the hotel that takes you to there or to Trafalgar Square  Over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged This time I was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com I will be coming back every time when I m able to secure such price Breakfast is disappointing  Clean hotel nice quiet location Very helpful and supportive staff especially at the reception Will be coming back as frequent traveler to London on business purposes provided that price is reasonable No Negative Nice modern clean decor Great location Close to tube and taxis Many restaurants or coffee places during the week Quite dead in the weekend Close to theatre area Trafalgar Square etc Absolutely nothing Everything fantastic stay at the hotel Enjoyed a lovely nights sleep and quiet Attention to detail superb i am a coffee fan and was pleased too see the kettle in the room was spotless inside not all full of limescale and quality filter coffee bags on the coffee tray which were really appreciated and coincidentaly my favourite type Really impressed with every aspect of this hotel and will definately returnNo Negative The staff were fantastic We requested an ice bucket and it was at the room almost straight away The gentleman who checked us in remembered my name Our bathroom had the most amazing bath and overall we felt we got upgraded  Booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast Were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price Conflicting information from the staff  Very comfortable bed and spacious en suite Very enjoyable stay  Food drink was delicious but a little pricey Stunning hotel superb location luxurious rooms Waking up to views of the London eye the shard Big Ben was a really bonus  There is absolutely nothing that we didn t like  Stayed here a year ago and if anything standards are even higher than before Friendly efficient staff spacious comfortable well equipped room Spotlessly clean in a peaceful central location No Negative The room was beautifully furnished and the walk in shower and spacious bathtub was superb The staff were fantastic very helpful and friendly Location was very convenient for Covent Garden s shops bars and restaurants Would definitely recommend  The breakfast is expensive  The size of room large and cosy Very comfy bed Being able to open the windows Great shower fluffy big towels bath sheets Coffee facilities in room quiet room No housekeeping knocking on door at 8am  Room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con Wifi is not super speed as stated in fact I couldn t log on at all for our two night stay  Very peaceful and quiet would not believe you were so close to the main roads Staff extremely friendly helpful Everything was spotless and clean Rubber duck is a great gimmick children loved taking him on our travels and taking pictures  An extra 30 charge I m still to work out for what The additonal 30 Wasn t on my receipt at checkout Would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the 10 mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout Especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout  The view was very good Big Ben Chard houses of Parliment Complimentary 1hr late checkout  My one experience in the dining room was not great I ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian  Quiet location in a courtyard off Fleet Street Spacious room with shower and full bathtub Extra comfortable and luxurious bedding friendly staff lively bar near the lobby Fifteen minutes walk from three different tube lines Fast reliable Internet Complimentary bottled water replenished each day  All night menu could have had better quality choices  Arrived late and had dinner and drinks at the lively bar lounge area Great room with stellar bathroom and toiletries The free coffee and hot cocoa in the room was replenished daily with a few complementary cookies as well Fast free wifi Loved the stay No Negative We stayed at the Apex after a conference I had in London last week The staff at the front desk and the lounge were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel was very modern very clean and very quiet We had a very comfortable stay and will definitely be looking to return to the Apex should our travels take us back to London in the near future  Would have liked an Easter Duck to go with our christmas duck Parking is quite a distance from the hotel However very good rate Would be nice to have the option of valet parking  Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble Rooms have everything you need very clean and comfortable Very quiet Love the Ducks Second stay at this hotel last was at christmas Stayed in the same room Comfortable walking distance to St Paul s South bank and Covent Garden to name but a few Will definitely stay again  Breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which I prefer but that s the only minimal thing I could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly Amazing room had a great bathroom staff were friendly and very helpful Room service was amazing and to channels too Best hotel I ve stayed in  Nothing could be improved Our stay was excellent  The hotel location the room and staff were all excellent The cleanliness and standard of the fixtures and fittings in the room hotel generally was excellent  Breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful  Lovely building tucked away nice quiet location but not far from theaters restaurants etc Door staff welcoming and friendly  There is nothing I would criticise the hotel for  It s a really good hotel in the City extremely comfortable and quiet considering the location This was my second time staying and I d have no hesitation returning in future  The only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with London We found it quite difficult to find Other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better  The room was amazing It was very spacious and immaculate Upon arrival the staff were very friendly and showed us where to go and advised on optional extras We thoroughly enjoyed our stay No Negative Staff extremely welcoming friendly Room service was extremely quick Generally the hotel maintains high standards Very pleased with this booking overall will definitely return  Nothing of note  Everything was perfect well ok the phone in Room 147 didn t work Friendly staff very professional and a great central location  Room backed into another building and thoroughfare Lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed The bed was especially comfy and the room was very quiet Great nights sleep  elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed  Lovely hotel Very comfortable Particularly loved the approach in the evening with the lighting red carpet and lovely elephant Breakfast good with plenty of choice for every taste Extremely good value we thought All staff were lovely Courtyard view splendid The bin men came a little later on a Sunday morning but hey we were in central London its noisier in 5 hotels Certainly not the hotels fault  Comfortable bed with lovely duvets and pillows Simply furnished but totally practical Very amenable staff  24 hour bar service would be good but I can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay  Lovely clean room good shower modern accommodation Staff were all very helpful and friendly Lovely bar area We were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay  It would be nice if it was a bit cheaper  Staff were friendly our room was ready when we arrived at 12 30 pm They changed our room from a double to a twin In room dining was superb food was fab  There is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside There has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers  Everything was great the service the rooms location No Negative Classy tasteful d cor great location courteous staff and some nice little touches in the rooms that made it feel special Nice place for a romantic getaway  Room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room Since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice  Comfortable spacious room Cleanliness overall Lovely shower  Did not take breakfast but expensive Bed and bedding and from fittings top quality State of decoration excellent clean paintwork tiling etc in bathroom Tranquil Obliging checkin and concierge service Nothing  Hi standard of accomdation Staff were very attentive and good attention to detail with luxury extras provided Only a 10 min walk to Covent Garden Very near to the Royal Courts of Justice Somerset House and the Strand  Too hot everywhere Air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at 19 degrees but it seemed to jump back to 24  Everything Breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere  The room was spotless was in a very quiet location even though off of Fleet Street only 15 mins walk to Covent Garden Theatres Very luxurious room with huge King bed enormous pillows Beautiful  too expensive for me most of the time  I love this place The only hotel I have found in this part of London where I am treated as an individual Amazing friendly service you feel you could ask what you want and the staff would try and help There was nothing not to like  The rooms were excellent the beds were super comfy Overall this is a really lovely hotel one i am definitely staying in again No Negative The location of the hotel is brilliant for all the main sights of London Rooms were spacious and clean bed comfy A taxi was booked for us no problem Decent price considering it s central London Will definitely book again Receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however I would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives  Bar and bar staff lovely Great cocktails Room huge for a London hotel and great value Facilities brilliant  Tea and Coffee facilities were good but not excellent These places never leave enough milk in the rooms This is the worst thing I can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad  Everything Beautiful building lovely rooms great staff and a fantastic price No Negative Polite helpful staff immaculate rooms and fantastic location Views of houses of parliament and millennium eye from our window Would definitely stay there again  Would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views Good standard luxuary hotel with Covent Garden Leicester Square Thames and theatres in walking distance Nothing we loved our stay  We got a room upgrade at a very cheap price The facilities were great location central and the staff were helpful and friendly  Wish we could have stayed longer Shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night  Fantastic hotel with great staff and facilities Nothing was too much trouble and the room was exactly as we expected Also loved the fact we could take the rubber duck away which also helps promote the hotel Very clever marketing  I would of loved to of stayed another night or two  Everything was perfect Just what I was looking for The room was magnificent The staff were very friendly and helpful It was a nice relaxing stay The breakfast the next day was delicious Really filled us up for the day ahead  We had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles We didn t get any and over 10 for 2 beers it would have been appreciated  Clean comfortable room excellent bed and pillows Excellent breakfast Very quiet in a busy city  There was no table and chairs on the balcony and only 1 plastic chair in the corner of balcony In a double room you d expect there to be 2 The room was big and spacious and the bed was soooooo comfy beautiful bathroom and shower and breakfast was amazing Not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues  Great location away from busy tourist areas but easy and quick access to West End Exmouth market where we went to eat on one night Could walk easily to Convent Garden and Soho and lots of buses to points beyond Very friendly staff excellent martinis at the bar Rooms clean spacious comfortable  Only a one night stay  Just a one night stay to see a musical at the Aldwych Theatre The hotel is ideally situated for Theatres numerous london attractions underground stations and the Thames The staff were superb we will go again  The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff  Beautiful building courtyard was stunning Marvellous location just a short walk from Temple tubestation along the Thames very pretty The staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday They delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special The lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it The design of the space left a long lasting impression The rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee  The maid coming into my room on both mornings at 0930 when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy Room was clean and tidy with lots of room and a comfortable bed No Negative From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we couldn t fault the staff hotel or facilities Best hotel we have ever stayed at in London Will definitely return Room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room  The room was lovely staff were brilliant too Very helpful offering maps and recommendations  Breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when I complained Not easy to get to by tube  Great rooms friendly helpful staff No Negative Nothing to fault with this hotel everything was perfect from start to finish we were also upgraded to a Superior room and a surprise birthday cake in the room The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were immaculate Will recommend to everyone and look forward to returning in the summer  Pillows to soft and room service to keen Woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning  Lovely decor friendly staff good location but it is about a 10 minute walk to a tube station Brilliant facilities large bath and walk in shower  the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet When we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on The personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet  Breakfast was good and worth the money personnel gave us 25 discount every morning  Nothing Everyone friendly tried hard to acknowledge my mums birthday and upgraded our rooms Excellent location and would recommend the hotel to anyone We paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify 25 It was the only bar part of the break  Room was amazing and the bed was awesome  The executive lounge was a let down and I would not pay the extra to access this facility again  The rooms were excellent and the staff were very helpful No Negative Very nice location within walking distance of all the main attractions and theatres The view from our window was the icing on the cake overlooking the London eye and the houses of Parliament The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble  The only thing was that I had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with 2 candles a 3 and a 0 and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel I was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles A bit dissapointed there cause I would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise  It was an amazing weekend I had planned a birthday surprise for my partner but the staff at the APEX took it further surprising both of us at the end  nothing This was our fourth stay here Never regret staying here Excellent hotel nice rooms great location for Westend theatres very helpful and friendly staff quiet And bonus views over London They forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon Even then they failed to clear a drinks tray Friendly mostly efficient but unobtrusive staff Comfortable clean quiet and convenient  The Club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits Canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water Great location great friendly and efficient staff  I still found the hotel a little on the expensive side Also not a big thing but if you re going to have a Bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded iPods iPhones  well located and very comfortable if not remarkable rooms No Negative Staff were very friendly welcoming was pleasant and all of my needs were met Room was spotless very comfortable bed and large bathroom with shower and bath Great views from the room and was extremely quiet would recommend high floor for good views of London Eye Big Ben and Shard Would recommend to anyone and will be returning shortly perfect  Bathroom too cold and not heated Towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted Also a little surprised by the Club Room no snacking possibilities No English beer  Great bed Room design nice  The price is steep It is quite luxurious but maybe not 200 a night luxurious  Fantastic location phenomenal staff gorgeous room It was a very luxurious stay I almost didn t want to leave the room I walked everywhere the hotel is in the middle of it all No Negative The staff at reception were incredibly helpful The room was very comfortable with a great sized bathroom with bath tub This was the first stop in a month long trip and it was a great way to start Very central location and within easy walking distance to all attractions We have already recommended the hotel to several people in the UK Europe  Not a single thing  The location is excellent midway between the west end and St Paul s The hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto Fleet St and the hustle and bustle of the City of London Staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful No Negative The customer service standard of accommodation quality of design and fixtures Staff were excellent cannot wait to come back Breakfast was excellent selection at breakfast was very good Our room 349 was stunning  Breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price They also added 12 5 service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty Great location and lovely breakfast selection Lovely clean room with large comfortable bed nice and quiet and amazing shower and bath No Negative Reception well staffed by cheerful and very helpful team Cleaner and better appointed room than much more expensive alternatives Will definitely retain as option for future trips to London Nothing everything was just right  This is an amazing hotel we first went in Jan 2015 for a six night break and loved it so much that we went in Jan 2016 for five nights The staff are very helpful and there are always plenty around The location is fantastic just a few minutes walk to the Strand and about 20 mins to Oxford Street The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the wifi works well and allows multiple devices to be logged on We like this hotel so much that we are now thinking about one of the Apex Edinburgh hotels for the end of Feb No Negative Excellent clean and comfortable room Top quality bedding nice to find a feather pillow Front desk staff were excellent everything was efficient without any fuss No Negative Everyone was very welcoming room was lovely bed was the best and great location After having received a call to make sure we had organised ourselves for Christmas Day lunch we decided to have Christmas lunch at the hotel which was good value Very nice touch Thank you Nothing to report Great location for NYE celebrations and only a short walk into Covent Garden etc Really nice spacious and well equipped room Helpful and friendly staff Would happily stay here again  There wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the New Year s Eve dinner menu was available However our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu  The view from our room and the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff  Nothing we didn t want to leave  The hotel is in a great location the staff were very friendly helpful and welcoming We loved our visit to the hotel which was our second time there and next time we are in London we will definitely stay here again  Children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on Selected an upgraded room lots of space comfortable and the Nespresso machine a nice touchNo Negative The room and facilities are very nice I really wanna stay in all day but yeah we re here to travel The location is good There s a bus stop right in front of the hotel but you may need to walk at least 10 minute if you come from any underground station nearby  Service is really poor in this hotel Very expensive for low value services For same price you can find something better in the same location There is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all  Good location in a nice area of London No Negative Comfortable small hotel with a lived in atmosphere Staff very helpful and all facilities you need especially for a place of this size Ideally located for Southwold Would stay again  Nothing maybe i would have loved to have a bath tub but the shower is good Staffs are very nice and helpful Well located with buses in front of the hotel to go to oxford streetNo Negative Perfect location You can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions London Eye Big Ben Buckingham Palace Tower Bridge as well as the shopping streets Covent Garden Oxford Street Hotel itself is very clean Nice personal The restaurant bar and roomservice are also good No Negative Comfort of the room is excellent especiallly the technology Sky tv and good quality free wi fi The hotel was quiet within and outside especially if you specify a rear facing room  I know this is London and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive  Extremely comfortable hotel Beautiful big rooms and bathroom Quiet and friendly  The bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks One of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental A poor experience compared to the Hilton or other equivalent lounges I wouldn t have minded that much but I purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access  Food in the restaurant was good and the size of the room was excellent No Negative Lovely hotel from start to finish Very clean comfortable and a good night sleep The staffs can t do enough for you well worth the money cant fault anything 10 10 Rude reception staff at check in Rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for 45 mins then when we enquirer where our other 2 rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was greatNo Positive We were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half 2 by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until 6 o clock However being the weekend before Christmas I can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be  I informed the hotel that we were staying for our anniversary when asking for a good view from the room and we were upgraded to a balcony with a wonderful view of London Staff were friendly and even put our bags in the room ready for when we arrived back at the hotel later in the day  Nothing  Brilliant location between west end and Thames riverside always extra special with a warm reception and courteous staff whether front desk or room service cleaners etc There was a big problem the staff apologized and I was to have received a refund of some money but I never did aThe issue was stressful I would not return Clean facility The standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better You literally could just walk around the edge of the bed Breakfast was very expensive We didn t bother just 5 minutes walk along the road was Pret where the price was a quarter as much  The room was very quiet considering we were in Central London The hotel is tucked away in a courtyard which is nice Very comfortable bed very nice walk in shower The location of the hotel is excellent easy 20 minute walk to Convent Garden or St Paul s Cathedral or Embankment to catch a boat along the Thames  Nothing Staff were super nothing was too much trouble Professional but approachable Lovely comfy bed so great night s sleep ready to explore all the places of interest so close to the hotelNo Negative The room was excellent warm with high quality facilities The toiletries were lovely and luxury fluffy towels We also had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurantNo Negative The hotel is in a very central location but tucked away quite discreetly so it feels private The room was very comfortable no sound carried over from the rooms or hallways allowing us a decent night of sleep The bathroom was beautifully luxurious and clean We also had a drink in the hotel bar which was very good No Negative Comfortable beds pillows and comforters Big bathroom with deep and nice bathtub AND large separate shower Luxurious bath products Fun bar Fri Sat nights No Negative We liked everything From arrival to departure and all points in between Apex Temple Court excels The hotel the facilities and above all the staff are just fantastic  It s not really a bad experience but I did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom There was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so I would request a different room next time  Comfortable room good breakfast and cooked options included in the price Nice bar area too  Nothing would happily stay in any Apex property and now considering a stay in Edinburgh Reception staff were superb the room we were allocated had a great view of the London Eye and Oxo Building Quality hotel nothing flashy or cheap All very modern stylish well run and looked after  Dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend Garfunkels near St Pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front Really good located close to musical Area and St Pauls very nice rooms big bathroom helpful staff Ok not major moans but Far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down Restaurant wasn t good just about ok Food a little cold and too pricey for what is was  Very clean hotel to the point of sparkling Comfortable standard club room with tea making Great location for major sighs but out of the hustle and bustle of the west end Hop on the bus hail a cab or walk 20mins to get almost anywhere  Breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a 25 discount  The staff were polite and helpful The room was well appointed and the bed was probably the most comfortable I have slept in It was a good location to get to Covent Garden and tube stations No Negative Nothing was too much bother for the staff I was meeting up with my sister and brother in law We had tea drinks etc in the lounge Not rushed at all  Expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value  Great facilities and the Club Lounge is well worth the extra price Staff very helpful and setting and location is excellent  We paid 39 for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking 3 mins away Why don t they advertise this A van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad  The staff were friendly and helpful At breakfast a waitress did not understand what we ordered but it was changed very quickly  We couldn t check in with two attempts even at 2 45pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone 9pm Although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully  Our room was lovely and the staff were attentive welcoming and very helpful No Negative The staff were friendly and helpful We received a complimentary upgrade the room was fab spacious and comfortable The breakfast was really good Second stay here would definitely return again No Negative The staff made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and we only had to wait 10minites for our room to be ready The room was lovely and quiet facing the courtyard The facilities in the room were great and we especially liked the big shower  Parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away The hotel could do with valet parking services  I have stayed at some top hotels in England but I have never stayed in a hotel where there were always 4 staff on reception There was never a queue to check in out or to have questions answered Great all round HotelNo Negative Perfect location clean modern hotel and we was given a complimentary upgrade as it was my boyfriends birthday Our room was beautiful and big with lots of lovely little extras that make all the difference Staff were very helpful with my request for an early check in thank you can not fault it we d definitely return  The walk from the nearest underground It s not really that far but I m pregnant so I struggled a little bit The comfort and cleanliness of the hotel room No Negative Staff were very friendly and welcoming upon arrival The free room upgrade was excellent The hotel facilities were very good The breakfast menu choice was wide ranging and the food was cooked perfectly The location was so convenient to the Inns of Court the City of London and to Central London  I just don t think a room without breakfast is worth 269 I suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it  very confy bed Great bar with lovely staff No Negative It just felt like a very nice hotel And most important for me was the comfortable clean room The friendly staff Big shout out to Paul It was nice to be able to relax in the lounge after seeing a show Location was very good I did not have breakfast so I cant review Michael Bathroom smelled soooo bad Like a dead rat un the pipes And at 9h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while I was still asleep what the hell  Very good bed and equipment in the room Nice people  Breakfast is quite pricey but lovely Second time staying at this lovely hotel Staff were once again warm and friendly with nothing too much trouble I travelled with my daughter for her 21st birthday and the staff all wished her a happy birthday and left her a lovely personalised note and a box of chocolates I love this hotel and can t recommend it highly enough Thank you Apex Temple Court for another wonderful stay  Breakfast in the morning is not very well organized Could wait more than 30 min before getting your english breakfast Great location room is not too small very clean comfortable bed Great hotel overall No Negative Modern very clean and very friendly hotel well located Food in the restaurant was excellent staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble readily adapted the menu for the children to suit Would definitely recommend and stay here again No Negative Room a good size and comfortable bathroom lovely Public areas bar lounge very nice when we came back after our theatre restaurant visits we ended our evening very pleasantly in the lounge staff very helpful and friendly  We found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped Minor points Only one hook in bathroom we needed more Lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard We could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water  We had a very nice stay 10 days Quiet location No Negative Very good location close to city centre and Thameslink railway spacious rooms nice bathroom and a lot of extra features The breakfast was also very delicious The staff is friendly and helpful  The only drawback no parking But there is a public car park 15 minutes walk from the hotel In the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking Special thanks to the staff for it  Liked everything Very comfortable hotel extremely friendly staff comfortable room Breakfast is excellent 10 15 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square No Negative Lovely location very close to the river and a short walk from temple tube Lovely walk through temple courts Efficient friendly hotel with a great bar really comfy seating and lovely atmosphere Restaurant looked good too but we had cocktails and bar snacks in lounge bar which was excellent if a little pricey Room styling is modern but well planned and feels a little luxurious Love the bathrooms at Apex hotels  Hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting 45 mins for their cooked breakfast However hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising Staff were very good and friendly Hotel is in a great location especially for theatre and Covent Garden Overall great place to stay in LondonNo Negative Although it s a busy city centre hotel it felt really peaceful and relaxing throughout The soundproofing in the bedrooms must be excellent because we hardly heard anybody else  As in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave A very common fault  The room design and furbishment comfy bed and pillows great bathroom  Only one european style 220 Volt electricity plug however Adapter would have been available  Beautiful spacious rooms with moden design but in a cosy way Very fast check in and check out Beautiful spot very quiet  Expensive glass wine but you pay for the location Not a problem We like to walk back from the theatre at night maybe for some people it would be few hundred meters past their comfort zone The room was very good and staff very helpful  Slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis Bedrooms and the style of the hotel Staff are lovely and the hotel is comfortable Easy to find off Fleet Street and close to major sightsNo Negative Excellent centre base for sight seeing Would definitely stay here again Worth mentioning if you have a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary while staying Perfect 10 out of 10 from us  Very few cons Entry from street was how we entered initially Not best with luggage Rear court entry hard to find was better Some cabs knew some did not Also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function  Many pros Very pleased here Modern clean Large room and bath Excellent stay Helpful staff Usually stay west of here but this location turned out to be perfect for this trip No Negative I booked this for my parents for their Golden Wedding Anniversary trip to London with another couple all four said how fantastic their stay was They commented in particular about how friendly and helpful the staff were and HOW impressed they were with their room and the hotel facilities No Negative We were a party of ten adults booked for a special friends birthday The staff upgraded the Birthday girl s room and had it decorated with balloons and banners that friends had mailed down This made a very special birthday a very memorable weekend Staff at the hotel were very obliging and couldn t do enough for us all  Breakfast is very expensive 21 12 5 even if compared to hotels like the Househorse Guards where it costs some 18 for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service It s better to go to Balthazar or even a Starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get  The hotel is clean and well located between both Temple and Chancery Lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them The room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need The bed is more for the very soft kind I personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard Staff is efficient and very kind No Negative What a superb hotel The room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the London Eye As it was my boyfriends 30th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake Everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy  The bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid  The Location was great We were able to walk to every thing we wanted to see  Breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate They forgot the orange juice  Excellent decor in the rooms and we ll equipped They gave my husband a small gift for his special birthday  A computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay However the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue  Large room comfortable bed good WiFi and easy access to public transportation The toiletries are also very nice quality Room was very quiet  The pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own  Hotel is wonderful Great accommodations clean and excellent location near Soho Convent Garden The restaurant and bar are expensive Not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the West End and Thames are just a short walk away Beautifully decorated room which was also immaculately clean The bed was gorgeous to sleep in don t think I ve slept in much better The grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the Tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on Sat Sun and Monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower More amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet Definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on  An excellent hotel with a great location Apart from a tap malfunction in the main bathroom everything was great A special mention to the concierge who managed to secure us tickets for the theatre at very short notice The Master suite was very roomy and very tasteful I would not hesitate to stay here when I am next again in London  Only minor thing was room wasn t ready 2 hours after we could have checked in We then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited 3 hours it would have time from check in to room ready  The staff were friendly the room didn t want for anything the ensuite was large and modern breakfast was fabulous  The only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers Do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out  The staff as incredibly helpful and attentive and the concierge is able to book tickets to attractions for us which made the whole process so easy We had a package for free breakfast our first night and the breakfast was amazing The location of this hotel is incredible It s located on a small side street that is very quiet but off of the main road in London Fleet St Couldn t have imagined a better place to stay in London  Menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to Gafunkals Cafe 2 min walk was a great alternative  Great location for all major landmarks so much so we walked to most from Westminster to Tower Bridge Staff very attentive responsive free upgrade on arrival enjoyed the whole experience so much we added another day to our visit Highly recommended  Nothing  We loved the fact that our room had a balcony have stayed in many hotels in London before and never had this luxury at what was a sensible price  The only tiny issue I have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service  The staff as well as the location and the tabouli rooms make this an ideal hotel for myself and partner to stay at every month when we are in London No milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had  Can t fault it second time we have stayed here and will undoubtedly stay again  Nothing Great hotel quiet room for a great night sleep as room overlooked a quiet courtyard so no road noise Newish hotel so everything felt fresh and up to date Great to have sky sports in room Have stayed in many London hotels and would rate this as one of the best night stays  I wish we could have stayed longer  The room was incredibly luxurious and clean the staff were friendly and attentive the location was brilliant a perfect hotel  Nothing Very comfortable room excellent amenities Peaceful to step away from London crowds be greeted by the green elephant Staff were always welcoming  nothing the staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome the room was fantastic big bed and superb bathroom i could not fault anything will definetly stay again next time am in london Ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table Reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu  Lovely hotel with nice furnishings and a courtyard for sitting out in the evenings Good breakfast too  Nothing  Courtyard out the back which takes you away from the main streets lovely place to sit for drinks staff were friendly and helpful And the rooms were lovely Expensive Restaurant lacked any character Location is superb for visiting the city Contemporary hotel design was good Breakfast was good We had a very good meal in the eveningNo Negative As per the review title this is an oasis in London the calm and quiet starts just yards from The Strand Very friendly and helpful staff Might seem expensive but you get what you pay for No Negative Had a really nice stay at this hotel received very good service and lovely rooms Breakfast and room service food was very nice Great location with only a 10 minute walk in to convent garden  Breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was Certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time  The room was big spacious and the bed extremely comfortable The bathroom was similarly huge and had a great standalone bath as well as waterfall showerNo Negative Location of this hotel was perfect Most of the sights that I wanted to visit can be visited on foot The room was comfort Somerset House was in 7 8mit on foot Staffs were friendly  The room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far  Good sized rooms Staff friendly and very helpful  Breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy A few items were unavailable on Sunday due to shortages The breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable  We were visiting London to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and the complementary upgrade to a deluxe room was the icing on the cake Thank you Apex x Nothing not to like second time we have stayed here  Excellent service we arrived at 11 30 am and we were still allowed to check in Staff very helpful and polite We love the apex hotelNo Negative The room was really spacious and light and the bed super comfy The rubber duck in the bathroom was a bonus and loved having sky movies No Negative Excellent location a lovely outside terrace where you could sit and have a drink or eat breakfast in the sunshine Would definitely come back Having to pay another 20 each if we wanted breakfast Breakfast extra which when the hotel is 210 per night is very poor  Not enough tea bags in the room  The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable The bathroom products were of good quality No Negative Well presented room pleasant staff and good public areas Enjoyed sitting outside for coffee Good location as we needed to be near Covent Garden  Food and drink are overpriced  Great location and a lovely room Huge bath and walk in shower A huge HD television with full sky package  Pillows were big but somewhat solid hard The pancakes at room service breakfast were hard around the edges  Great size room for money No Negative A haven of peace in hectic London A great hotel which I have visited twice now and which I have promoted to my standard London hotel No Negative The room was absoulty amazing Clean Comfortable Felt very welcomed and the front look of the hotel with the elephant was spactauclar To say something the wardrobe in our room was very small  Everything was ok the place was very clean comfortable and the location very convenient  Breakfast was not included in the price  Celebrating a special birthday they give a free upgrade to a suite and a bottle of bubbly  Nothing The bar food the room upgrade was a wonderful bonus This was our second visit and we will be making a third next yearNo Negative The size of the bathroom and bedroom not cramped in any way with lovely touches such as Bose docking station and Samsung flat screen TVNo Negative They call themselves a hidden gem in London And that s very true It was my first visit here and it will not be my last No Negative We liked the style the staff the 24 access lounge the location which is good for taxis and buses or just walking to the Thames  Breakfast was a bit hit and miss and expensive The quiet location is unusual for London Able to sleep with the window open They did a mistake but thier attitude was not enough to me and around hotel there are few resturant open until night Good  none Great location Rooms fantastic and they upgraded me to a suite it was huge When I an going to London I am always stay here  Staff were difficult to locate when wanting to order drinks etc in bar on multiple

              "['i am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place i made my booking via booking com we stayed for   nights in this hotel from   to   july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the  nd floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the   level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining   times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day so i had to check out the next day before   o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till     in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room   i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell and it did not stop even at   am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife i have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail the next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only   room left the one that was smaller but seems newer only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful no negative no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to amsterdam rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps so ask for single level inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge location was good and staff were ok it is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice will go back my room was dirty and i was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage i also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests i understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after i complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when i was already in bed and ready to sleep great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area the building also has quite some character you when i booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room i thought i was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly which was completely false advertising after being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s  th birthday present please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again i didn t really know what i was paying for and how much it had wnded up being your photos told me i was getting something i wasn t not happy and won t be using you again amazing location and building romantic setting backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with   stars good restaurant with modern design great chill out place great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed they also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it the room is spacious and bright the hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park apart from the price for the brekfast everything very good good location set in a lovely park friendly staff food high quality we oth enjoyed the breakfast even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived also check in is at   o clock but our room was not ready at that timeno positive the aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night the room was big enough and the bed is good the breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening many people are having picnics and do some bicycling nothing all great rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building pictures are of room   the true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly also the bath was lovely and big and inviting great more for couples restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a   minute walk away and only about   or   stops from the centre of amsterdam would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too     am started big noise workers loading wood down the windows stupid room numbering system it took   minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms the check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction no late dinner bar closes at   am ugly view on trash lorry from windows no information about the computerized telephone huge price difference between booking com price   euros and hotel price   style location rooms the floor in my room was filfy dirty very basic rooms i had a  yr old tv in my room fridge did not work overpriced breakfast comfy bed good location no negative this hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location my spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park the breakfast selection was spectacular all considered this was a great hotel for the price and i plan to return the staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him it was very good very historic building that s why i chose it no negative this hotel is awesome i took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park arrive in the city are like   minutes by tram and is super easy the hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room i ll come back for sure there the staff very gentle one spanish man really really good very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children i asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one room decoration was minamilist which i like but felt prison cell sparse great onsite cafe amazing building park location amazing bobby gin and tonic we did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this the room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment we loved the location of this hotel the fact that it is set in a park away from the busy centre of dam square was great the tram system was brilliant and easy to handle the hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from ireland no negative public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt its an old building and clearly has old building issues we had issues with our electronic key everyday it deactivated it wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue the staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail the tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily and the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival that situation didn t change other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely i liked the hotels history and for such an enormous hotel i can t imagine how many girls were orphaned i liked their breakfast it was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs juices tea and coffee bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase no usb port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous some corridors were poorly lit friendly staff oostpark a few yards away good continental breakfast selection quiet and relaxing area our room was an overrated disaster room   dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then   euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery the breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet we did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional we had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location sadly i cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me when we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed we called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us we waited at least half an hour and no one showed up we had to go to the front desk and complain again when we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot we were however no interest to complain anymore also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which i had to ignore the whole time i didn t feel comfortable at all the staff at front desk are very friendly however i guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies first you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway what more annoying is that i got woke up at   in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms and they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour they kept open and close the door i was really annoyed i was in my holiday and i just wanted to have a good sleep at least the parking place was small but ok when we arrived the ticket machine was broken someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in we did so and paid for   days when we checked out when we drove out the ticket machine was broken again so we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still i was not so happy because i have the feeling that i paid for nothing the location is good you need  min to  min walk to the center depends on your speed the hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design the bed was really comfortable transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly nothing lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by  min walk or the tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a   mins walk to the hotel all in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning the bathroom in our room was a black glass box it theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall it did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv great location in the park near museums and restaurants perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right friendly and helpful staff i m nothing at all to do with the hotel of course but people tend to slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a slam to awake you other than that nothing to fault at all the hotel itself is in a lovely location a  min if that tram ride into the center train right outside the hotel easy access to everywhere the staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds bathroom was clean spacious and airy we had shampoo body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees it literally has everything you need in the room perfect hotel couldn t fault it at all the lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great tennis court outside the hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around careful they are still renovating the building and start at  am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you great hotel original concept style we had   different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans there was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom the hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits there is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel the hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced the bathroom is not very practical the hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features there is a big park just opposite to the hotel public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close good wifi all around the hotel little bit on the pricey side the staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning extensive restorations works going on we had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view temporary reception area the building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside when the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous no fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective friendly staff the bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park very modern our bathroom had an urine order shower was very slippery no shower chair handles or bars bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off very expensive and breakfast was not included construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it there was a park and that was nice not close to town or museums no positive please see above the hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect however the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible the rooms were cold although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming it could use some design help an area rug or two the room was very big spacious the bath tub was large enough for two people i love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains the park location was amazing construction on site but not mentioned on booking com the breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms they do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable the park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour also the bathtub and bed is great not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park the glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double it is necessary to darken the glasses much more very nice hotel located in a park ca   minutes by walk to the city center not typical for amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings but pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights but apart from that there is not really much i dislike about the hotel i suppose if there is one thing the room i had did not have a view only other rooms but i dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal i can find that i did not like plus stayed for   nights and this place was perfect for that the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam i would definitely like to stay here again i only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as a brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts i was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and i personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good i will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to amsterdam staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say i don t know the answer let me find out for you there didn t seem to be a manager around unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished the temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows this is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy the hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building the building itself has great history and wonderful architecture the staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love first room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes we requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than   minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading fault reported but not rectified during our stay the building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at     per head location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre staff very courteous hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although i prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino room was huge     meter high ceilings and freezing cold heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium and for all that i paid   never again love the design of the renovated product the park nearby for a walk water pressure in my shower was no existent feel bad even saying that staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in the cafe is very cool will be back the service was awful they refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning the brunch to purchase in the morning was good bathroom lighting could have been brighter the airconditioning of our room   could not be turned down lower than   degrees celcius the refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat the toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either the location of the hotel is super opening out to oosterpark the staff was very helpful and friendly the bed was very comfortable the room was spacious enough for   people the hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when i booked it or at any point until we arrived there we then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby the room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which i first discovered with my barefoot we woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete hardly the relaxing break from noisey london that i believed i had booked the pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris the first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell their   breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead we spent   in   days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends   minutes before this hotel even comes into view they will also take   deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay this meant on arrival i suddenly had to pay a further   which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction we made the best of it but i really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and i definitely would have stayed somewhere else massive bed the hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram the hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups the hotel looks really impressive set in a beautiful location the room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable i d ever slept in no negative the quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise the location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants i cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone service horrible pillows super stiff and big could break your neck room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened service in general was poor i would not stay here clean and new the bar was shut when i got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a saturday night in a city like amsterdam my room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building the room i was given was enormous and very comfortable i wish i had been staying for a week not just one night when arriving i was told i had to pay   city tax that wasn t shown on the policies i pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals the sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor when checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us we waited   minutes after   we asked how long it would be she said i will check she said that twice made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight wasn t happy at all the location and views i loved everything the location in a quiet park with a great terrace the space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste the gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable it s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in amsterdam staff was very friendly and accommodating the restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eatno negative beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepctionno negative the hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing they even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when i emailed them about this when i first booked online this was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town it is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too i would highly recommend there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at    pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until   mid night location in the park cool interior design comfy bed some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of amsterdam room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly the hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets personal preference the location was perfect and so beautiful only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really no negative basically everything the style of the hotel is really great the breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar the wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel the location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center i loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure the staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that thumbs up from me the place is completely mismanaged the property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice don t stay here if you are expecting a   star experience it s a   star location with   star service the restaurant service is the worst i have ever experienced the staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently the hotel has many strange design choices too had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet shower overflows all over bathroom quickly you can see into the urinals from the reception area loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs this is the only negative review i have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management the property is beautiful the bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again i d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday we got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful lovely room very comfy bed very bad attitude of personnel at breakfast only allowed one coffee from the coffee machine filter coffee was free rude behavior of the manager room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room location is good they gave me some freebies for noisy room the bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe the hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park the hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us just bad organisation on room allocation great trip staff very friendly asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip nice open room bed plenty of room bath room clean fridge was a nice touch easy to get in and out staff accommodated us fast and politely room was not cleaned correctly wine champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged from the day we arrived to begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after it has undergone some major renovations since i last stayed there the new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property super impressed with the park and the way nature comes together with the hotel new dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing the bathroom was amazing though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times they should think about a screen or opaque glass beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff quick tram to leidseplein and metro to central our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues i would recommend the hotel to anyone the bath and shower room was amazing beautiful hotel they are going through a refebishment at the moment and i am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which i think will look even more stunning then the building is already the breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized the young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests this was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out i would expect a better experience for that price the building was fantastic all renovated areas were very stylish the receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place breakfast i missed cutted fresh fruits for muesli couldn t find the cheese and for capuccino you had to pay extra the young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful dinner has been cooked excellent the sink in the bathroom was very dirty when i got the room unacceptable the room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive the location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added if you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel the glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty nearly all the guests we came across we re british but there was a complete lack of english breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast what made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast the hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast lovely hotel with lots of history great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bedno negative the whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly the dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well the room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again the hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking we had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction the location on the park is excellent and very peaceful the restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee rooms were a little louder than we would have liked a lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed no negative hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful i requested a split level room which they gave me when i arrived the room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy the hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the metro would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning no negative we have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms there are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special our room   was just gorgeous the hotel is being renovated which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at  am we paid eur  for a large room but really it was not worth the money the location is beautiful i m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel i can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete we didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel especially the hall to our room the cleaniness of the rooms can be better check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up and cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel we like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed the man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful the room was lovely great hotel beautiful location the hotel is currently being renovated being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above mini bar empty no remote for the tv heating direct above the bed and quite noisy the restaurant opened   days before however the food was good especially the burger good breakfast with fresh orange juice wifi in all hotel initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms staff a very helpful and chatty it s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer that i wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works we had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments when walking around there was nobody very empty feel the bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss the food was absolutely gorgeous maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping stained carpet not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from    m high not much useful information no minibar understaffed reception long wait pretty building interesting rooms no ground floor room as requested   months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par much better last time we stayed prices gone up room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences we booked   twins and were given   and a double which they couldn t change not happy plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain a lot more interesting and quirky even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably no remediation possible toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests some were empty some partially used checkout at      hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time having paid over   for   night stay this is somewhat disappointing service at breakfast was very poor shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done large bed the room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere it s a beautiful hotel or should i say will be when the renovation is finished in a terrible state with builders everywhere we had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair good location cheap so lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying one person in our group got  v electric chock which went through her hands it came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately the hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room they also let us have a late check out for free of charge thats all of the compensation we had in my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think the managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it the hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too it anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there location of the hotel is about  km from the nearest metro station the rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in however there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion there were construction works and such information was not passed to us when we booked there was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower too dark common reas beautifull buiding next to oosterpark friendly staff great breakfast the work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate great room very comfortable bed nice and quiet fantastic decor and amazing staircases the location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour the immediate area is fantastic great park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available near by brewery that do tours not heineken and great beer good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center no negative we upgraded to a larger room had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep i ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building however the design tried to maximise its quirky layout a very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding got charged   for a birthday package when it was advertised for   on the website this was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of the shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use we were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower couldn t check us into our room at  pm had to wait extra   minutes standard breakfast was very expensive at   i highly suggest not to buy cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend no positive split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical   tv remote for both tv s but on differernt floors a c is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust the walls are also very thin not good sound proofing beautiful surroundings great location old world style of the hotel is really different building work starting at  am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance also air conditioning very very loud location hotel is having some construction work done this i can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not   star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down i thought location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll there was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot the staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates the staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing so our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant the bed was amazing actually our whole room large room the park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location i love amsterdam building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle staff were brilliant really helpful attentive and friendly amazing building with lots of history too construction during the day though not intrusive great customer service staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and metro passes the front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined the rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly the breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from no limited a c in common areas dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters musty smell throughout common areas deluxe rooms very small impractical design impractical shower design no place for soap poor quality bed mattress room refrigerator barely worked food in restaurant overprices only fair quality overall dark rundown dreary appearance good water pressure in shower there was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place the hotel is located in a very nice area of amsterdam there are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city staff were very kind the hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious we upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful staff promised things they didn t deliver room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant generally clean and interestingly designed but a little worn meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process the reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots no negative architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels the arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space location is fab in the green space of oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the city halls the rooms are quirky with a small footprint the ground level has a closet small sofa wc and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level there s a tv on each level no negative breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night no negative this hotel was great value for money only a few tram stops away from the city centre it was close enough for all the attractions of amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood the zoo is literally a   minute walk away or one tram stop very accessible the room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep i ve ever had i would highly recommend this hotel we would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated we had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at     because of the noise booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel very friendly staff lovely comfy room i wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only   food recommendations were brilliant the outside of the hotel is under construction it will look beautiful when it s done the inside of the hotel is very classy he staff are friendly and helpful our room was great huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed the hotel is a nice area there is a big park next door and it is only a   minute walk to the heineken experience the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times the bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering the staff member who checked us in charged us a   security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to the hotel was warm and beautifully decorated we were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice the hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation the sidewalk entrance was a mess there was no mention of this at all on the booking com website we were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation not good enough the location of this hotel is great it s very close to the tram lines and subway the staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking the breakfast buffet was fine major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion room on   levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience after complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby staff very friendly willing to help the first room had steep steps to a loft bed not practical and dangerous for someone   especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night second night had a room on one level no positive the bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all the room size was also pretty small well located if you don t mind taking the train our suite on the   floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle the staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered for the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority it is starting to look frayed at the edges but there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good the location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam the shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster the room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges the bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare the stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids you definitely get what you pay for it was half clean and not very central liked the staff the location overpriced breakfast bed too soft bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on building works impact on overall good impression special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel relaxed atmosphere nice restaurant and bar area with terasse good accessibility of public transport we were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in   days we had to ask for more towels we ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after   mouthfuls my friend was sick room was a great size and comfy bed we did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains told reception but nothing was done about it it definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back the staff were lovely and very helpful bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links the bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to the lighting in the halls was too dim there was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent the snacks in the restaurant were also very good the staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful the bed was comfy we had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought we told reception but nothing came of it very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows we stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful two storey room with narrow winding stairs wet room d cor and functionality lack of storage space very helpful and friendly staff free wifi location and proximity to public transport provision of iron and board   televisions there was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom this means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night the hotel has its own character and a long history very cool vibe we got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside it would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor it was noisy from the main street it was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes there was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this i am sure it will be very nice when it is finished good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history first impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with also we were given a duplex suite to start with dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about the hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak english restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park foyer was a mess only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two we had a very cold spell and it was draughty the first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over   or afraid of hights the second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair the hotel states it is four star but is not it feels like a up graded backpackers it is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max i thought i was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was the hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking it was very disappointing and embarrassing as i had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms no positive the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken very poor the friendly staff in bar restaurant the evening meal was excellent a pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful after the building renovations i think this hotel will be fabulous it has so much history and is so unusual loved it the only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well the staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy there was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work great room great staff great food building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming gothic look of reception area checking out at    am wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way see through glass to shower food in restaurant quirky place use to be a hospital reasonably convienent for transport into city centre beautiful park beside hotel walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast we didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move roomsno negative beautiful gothic hotel very good location some nice bars and restaurants fabulous thai restaurant   minutes away   metro stops from dam centre really enjoyed staying there there was building work ongoing but you would never have know the fact i had to leave the whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful the d cor but hotel is currently being extended i expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished room was lovely we got a free upgrade bathroom fab excellent breakfast nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice the interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking this hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay currently have building work in the complex this didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive very comfortable bed and cool hotel stairs in our room were too narrow and steep no where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road hotel was very clean and staff helpful very trendy and reasonably priced we booked a   night stay in a suite on arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places during the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at   i went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened it turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room he came to apologise with a feeble excuse i tripped and fell into the door we didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us i asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was we went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with no it wasn t i came home to find my credit card had been charged   from them i phoned them up to complain and the money was returned however i have lost about   in bank charges due to their incompetence terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel no positive the noise of the construction works that began at  am sharp in the mornings the see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper the bed was huge and comfortable massively high ceilings and the feature staircase the hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on mon morning staff were very friendly helpful the kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive there were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside however in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that i can only put down to the work outside it was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely considering it was a   star the room could have been abit neater ie the corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major the style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom our kingsize was very comfy and spacious the hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings all of the staff spoke english perfectly just like most people in the city and i couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places hotel arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a   minute walk from a tram stop to centraal dam square rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring it s also right next to oosterpark so i can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in amsterdam as it was mine more sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down no mention of the building work going on location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but i m sure it will look amazing really funky room when we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste the bed was super cosy the staff was nice the hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle room   should be discontinued it is really too small and only upsets your customers breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others you could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel got off to a bad start room   was tiny and they changed us no argument bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel and great shower no negative bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre also th bathroom walls are completely see through wouldn t advise number   s if you are sharing a room the cleanness was quite poor a lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night the staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice the bed was quite confortable being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink i d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening if you are going to compensate do it properly average good accommodation big room helpful staff room cleaned daily big hot shower comfy bed the first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom i raised this with the staff and was given another room however we where there   days and the housekeeping is shocking they do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets they just come make ur bed that s all same cups same rubbish it s disgusting please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy do not book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where i could see the toilet from the bed other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid the only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks considering they have work going on location is great  mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in  mins also we bought   day travel ticket from the train station for   euros n the hotel sell this for     euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam only to and from airport i hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together that may just be a european thing or maybe i got the reservation wrong either way i would still go back to this hotel the place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle the hotel was in a bad condition not really clean and everything was worn out breakfast was barely ok and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when i got it hotel arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise bed was nice rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained really nice building but lots of building work going off but only outside so not a problem good size rooms fairly modern good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram wifi worked perfectly and quickly the hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly the room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which i thought was poor no bath in room even though i requested one on booking   reception changed rooms immediately after complaint radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem the staff were very friendly and helpful rooms s good size nice bathrooms bar area very comfortable complimentary drink a nice touch a little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around plans for development look amazing would like come back when completed location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through the room was exactly as expected the bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was huge easy check in and check out only a   minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a    min walk the hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive great hotel and quiet university area wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms the food is wonderful the shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back the room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works but very good value for money the bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay very happy with our room for the money that we paid no negative the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive the room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning i would recommend this hotel to anyone nothing one of the receptionist she did a racist comment regarding my accent and my country the housekeeping didnt like was a disaster enter in the room without knock the door a tall girl no positive breakfast was crazy expensive location required about a   minute walk to the nearest subway construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows very memorable the hotel is right next to a large nice park staff was friendly the location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough the hotel looked out of place there when upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra   one of the pillows was filthy a call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour but still not what you would expect room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu the rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere due to building work in progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all   of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked   separate rooms for a reason we booked   double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in   twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the   pound that was spent no positive the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over   days must of been greeted and welcomed by   different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking the decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredibleno negative the hotel is amazing beautiful interior we weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof our room was fantastic the only thing i should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below  oc the room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush the bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards room service good quality staff we didn t have a bad experience we loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue hotel was very modern and location was great complimentary drinks was a really nice touch no negative stayed in this hotel for   nights with my boyfriend the hotel was perfect a short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy we really enjoyed our stay breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish they charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means unfortunately they charged   of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location when i arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before i booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done all the lovely garden had been tourn up then the next morning i got rudely awakened at         by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so that s probably why i wouldn t stay at hotel arena again i was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full english breakfasts the bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy it was nice the shower was clean i enjoyed my room wasn t allowed to check in till   but managed to get us a room by  ish which was good finding no car park when i had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying there was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way the staff were a bit abrupt not really listening i asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening i called reception they said one coming very soon i had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told some time later i had said i wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten i took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before the answer was no but we could have a fan i said no because i did not want to risk waiting the room was pleasant we liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable the mini fridge safe tv s with english channels and the ability to make drink were pluses the shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light a lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction the location unfortunately were a bit far from the center   min by tramp the room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best i ve ever seen the staff is very kind i would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel   min to the center the fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed woken by builders two mornings at  am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion the room we upgraded to was very nice breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a gym swimming pool location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again the hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside during working hours the noise can be very disturbing the facilities look and sound rickety the a c is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold what s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls chinese water torture anyone the bathroom walls are transparent and i don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint i mean oh my word i didn t want to see that there is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom the staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them   days in a row with no new towels the hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it if you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead or another hotel polite staff the bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar i thought this was a nice gesture until i was repeatedly told i can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or  cl beer you might have well not bothered hotel arena it was more like an insult the staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful the rooms were clean stylish and comfortable the hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of amsterdam the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at  am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when i reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working i stayed there   days never again nothing in our own experience first night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the ac the next day we were moved to a better room ok but i was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t ac was very noisy also in the new room and last at reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost  euro after doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us   euro the driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from arena staff was vey pleasant the place is very well designed arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated on the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level the space of the lower level is very small   of it is bathroom no cafes and supermarkets in the nearby no minibar in room only at reception arena is hardly a   star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a   hotel only location is good it takes   mins by feet and     mins by tram to get to the city center reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful the room was stunning did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door will definitely recommend cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost   euros driver charged us   euros but only payed   euros from the airport to the hotel very smart room good food no plug with washbasin staff did not think this was a problem though i did had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine breakfast staff the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked the toilet has glass walls no privacy the room was dirty after   days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small i don t understand how this hotel has   stars the day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at     because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel the hall partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction no negative staff were really friendly  hour front desk beautiful hotel the room i stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food and easy trams into central   mins i highly recommend room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived we found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned in addition the daily cleaning was very basic unacceptable for an hotel of this category such a pity because everything else was great my advice to the management is more attention to details having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board not conductive to maintain grow the business listen to your customers please very beautiful building cozy room cool bar no negative staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train breakfast was nice but very expensive close to tram excellent room nice staff renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at     am and woke you up there is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of   euros for nothing in the room they dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of   from you no positive the room wasn t cleaned two days in a row i don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times good wi fi no negative good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp no noise problem but the lovely garden is gone sill good value for money this is a big place lovely old building at first glance it looks like a dream hotel but then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom but at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room the doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room there really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors in addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you clean room we had not exchanged towels for   days until we asked the best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with   hotel having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room having to ask for towels that were not left in the room room   no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc character of the hotel was great location was goodno negative hotel and rooms were beautiful my friend and i wanted some luxury on our trip to amsterdam and this hotel provided just that the staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc you will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip would definitely recommend this hotel the only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests it was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future the staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them the room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for no on site car park available despite pre booking of this hotel was a building site so not very welcoming no privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had no positive next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked i didn t try it way better than the usual amsterdam culinary sinsno negative this was our first time in amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful they took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at    am great location lovely room the room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram the hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy especially the entrance area is affected but the hotel does need a facelift boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms no negative it was a well kept hotel in a lovely area the staff and services offered were excellent we felt it was a great value our beautiful room with a view was a bonus its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking  mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway this is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive also i would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance no noise or dirt at all the hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on oosterpark which is awesome the location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and     mins to poi convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city you can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about    mins very clean room made and towels changed everyday almost perfect no convenient stores surrounding hotel area had to walk quite far for grocery shopping crews being nice and helpful environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction the pillow and the double charged city tax one of the staff at the reception is not so nice the bathroom and sofa are so good the building style is really awesome we don t like the open concept shower it gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though the hotel room was otherwise very nice we liked the location and the extra pleasant staff they were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows no negative i loved the hotel design and decoration staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling that is something you really appreciate when you are on a   hour business trip breakfast was way better than i expected although coffee was quite bad that is something most hotels fail to nail and i think most guests find it important rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable iron wasn t very good bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it building works took away from quality of hotel we didn t like they reserved   on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done the bed was comfy and large the wifi was fast and good separate living area powerful showerno negative got in late and hadn t eaten   hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at  pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is   mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town no negative we stayed at the hotel for   nights hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes hotel is situated in a quite area the rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy the staff is very nice and helpful theres nothing we was unhappy with really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at  am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airportno negative the matress and pillows were exceptionally good best sleep in terms of comfort ever i would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home the rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding the hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space i was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside fantastic value for money but i assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in amsterdam the bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite the hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of amsterdam in only     minutes our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room   was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food n a this is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay there is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history also the shower was incredible no negative we loved our stay at hotel arena the hotel was great staff was really kind especially for job the guy encharged of the restaurant and sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and i got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel that night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room it was a very classy detail we were so thankful about it also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant food is great thank u for everything hotel arenaaa it s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre everything the friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar it was truly pleasant to stay in hotel arena no bad experiences amazing rooms with beautiful view of river food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon staff are helpful and friendly floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate hall way to rooms on  nd floor was too dark gloomy reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in i question the   star rating staff good location suited us the bathroom needed to be deep cleaned tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating great historic buildig there was a problem with the hairdryer in our room the hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror just a minor detail really but a bit annoying the hotel was great the rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive the hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes there were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times how different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram accessno negative this is an older building with a wonderful refurbishment our bedroom and bathroom were state of the art and perfect the dining experience was also excellent we had a problem with one meal but it was fixed immediately will go back the variety of the breakfast was not as good empty marmalade coffee was more water was convenient because our friends live close by furhthermore i liked the possibility of renting a bike on short notice and the interior was spectacular liked the modern twist small room in   levels connected by a very narrow and small steps the room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window the terrace lounge the building the location our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night the staff were very friendly and very helpful rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more very comfortable big bed free wi fi lovely building and interior the only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay   days this wasn t an issue a great place that is stylishly decorated the beds are really comfortable and the shower is fantastic the room we had also featured a lovely little loft with two chairs a desk and a tv the extra space made the place a lot nicer than your standard hotel room no negative i loved the room there was so much space spanning two floors the staff were super friendly and gave us great advice on locations to visit during our stay in amsterdam a bit noisy you can hear a lot through the walls it s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look there are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to central and both go to the main tourist hub oosterpark right on your door step service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building location outside terras minimal space around the bed breakfast was very good but it wasn t included in the price of the room right by the ostpark which is very pleasantno negative super stylish hotel next to a lovely park close enough to the city centre but far enough if you get me no negative standard room is amazing location is adorable everything was stunning from a to z from indoors design to really good noise isolation our room was small air con leaked and staff wasn t very helpful outside of the hotel was beutiful and the surrounding areas the hotel was under renovation while we there which we were not advised of before booking the bed was very comfortable and the room was very cleanno negative location was superb overlooking oosterpark nice and quiet away from the city centre tram stops very close by and metro not far away overcharging for the parking lot room was as shown on the pictures cozy posh and really stylish staff was trully polite and helpful nearly everything about my stay the only thing i love was that the bed was comfy and the building on the outside everything else i hated service in the restaurant was very slow and not the best beautiful hotel with views of the park transport links are very close and excellent i booked a twin room so thought there would be twin beds but got put in a double room with a double bedno positive wifi service wasn t great and we couldn t actually connect large clean rooms with a nice size comfy bed all round just very clean could hear other people shutting doors but didn t bother us much at all the room was so clean and tidy the bed was amazingly comfey and so big it s just a little bit out of the centre about   min walk to the centre we loved this hotel and our beautiful hotel room no negative we stayed in a studio room the room was spacious it was clean the bed was very comfortable the staff were helpful polite and professional there is no enough space in the room my room even to put your clothes the architecture the bar area the staff are kind and helpful a little far from the centre but trams frequent bed was so comfortable staff we very helpful had a nice stay at this hotel room had a bad smell radiator was making leaking sound hotel was under construction noises started at   am building was so nice rooms were bigno negative the hotel building is amazing they are renovating and perhaps some of the problems will be overcome when the works finish bit noisy dark hallways nice room with bedside on a loft and the nice gesture for a free drink due to renovation of the premises no negative staff were very helpful they even organised a little surprise on my birthday room was great very spacious with huge bed the room felt cramped the staff at breakfast was a little to busy to help out when asked the breakfast area is niceno negative the staff was very friendly and helpful loved the old charm of the architecture rooms were clean bar had a great courtyardno negative staff were incredibly polite and willing to help at all times hotel is in a very good location and facilities are brilliant the shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet the room was so luxurious very comfy bed and modern decor hotel had character the hotel was situated a little too far out of town lovely room taseful decor and artwork around the hotel friendly and helpful staff really nothing negative to say about this hotel very comfortable beds smart bathroom good shower lovely facilities garden an absolute delight friendly staff quiet location no coffee or tea in the room or lobby no one to help with our bags from tax into the hotel no handicapped access at   years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the   oursidestairs and then up into the lobby no positive room was pretty small for the three of us the staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants nothing really we stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation it has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings would definitely stay there again only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others   pounds plus tip super location on division underground line direct to heathrow and central london older facility but very accommodating staff good breakfast many restaurant stores     block away bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish quite comfy but small rooms beautiful garden in back overall a great value for london would stay here again london hotel rooms are very small there was very little storage would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory plenty of choices for all bed was very comfortable bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water location could not have been better very short walk to underground beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel very quiet in spite of being close to earl s court rd staff was friendly and helpful everyone was very easy to deal with the room for three people was on the small side there was a beautiful garden at the back of the property where guests could relax in the sunshine read order a drink etc a great location very close to earls court restaurants and tube good breakfast room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from leeds to london and phoning  hours away to reserve parking rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space we arrived at     and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further  minutes just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for   night and had a concert to go to fantastic location very clean room someone called leanne i think on reception was helpful and kind breakfast was lovely great choice our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet we had to require a different room at an extra cost of   a night breakfast was excellent staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table the cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good the garden was a bonus lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink secure parking was also a good feature the room was a lot smaller than advertised i requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the  nd floor they changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at  am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise once reported to the front desk i was asked to move rooms at  am no assistance was offered second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much i thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable i didn t find the staff very friendly they weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe the gym is not worth calling a gym has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the earl s court underground station clean quiet breakfast was a good quality and selection nice pillows lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains newly remodeled marble slate bathroom mini fridge in room desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up beautiful garden area i didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area lower ground floor room l  possibly the smallest bathroom i ve ever stayed in awful view from windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside won t go back location first and foremost lovely gardens dimensions of the room small but i m was a single room and erls court london the space cost money as a traditional london hotel very good hotel professional people s and very well organized unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure i will pay for this not more than   p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level squeaky floors difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband also  th floor our window didn t open to the outside clean comfy beds beautiful gardens excellent helpful staff no negative the staff were all so professional and friendly they really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made the hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the earl s court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions i would totally recommend the k k hotel george not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first we were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days and we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements it was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and b b in which we stayed on this three week uk vacation we would not recommend k k hotel george nor would we return ourselves small but modern and well furnished room nice linens and a superior small bathroom the hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us the hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family the hotel has a inside garden beautiful english style where you feel relax with a glass of beer it s very close to the earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night we like this hotel the front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips fortunately i could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions additionally i was not entirely confident that they understood the questions i was asking in english fantastic breakfast buffet great location quiet rooms no negative we stay at this hotel each time we are in london in a nice quiet street just a short walk to earls court underground station the staff are always friendly rooms are always cleaned properly it s just a nice place to return to after a long day in london great buffet breakfastno negative great position lovely having breakfast overlooking beautiful garden which you could have a walk around or seat and relax staff were very helpful and friendly staff not very friendly did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed location near the earl s court underground very convenient restaurants nearby good location away from the tourist bustle but very easy to get around london via the tube room size too small and it was too hot our window was too small and it good lighting we stayed on the  th floor and i believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there the staff was very helpful the room was a little stuffy they didn t have ac on yet probably too early in the season shower sometimes went hot and then cold hotel was nice and comfortable very clean room was a bit small but adequate staff was friendly and helpful the location was great because it was a   minute walk from   underground lines plenty of restaurants convenience stores and atm nearby the shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back we really liked the breakfast there was a wide choice of food the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants it is also close to the subway station no negative room as advertised excellent location a   minute walk to buses and the tube friendly and helpful front desk staff would love to stay here on our next london trip too choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem quiet comfy room very helpful staff excellent location just off the earls court tube and lots of excellent places to eat close by the fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential closeness to piccadilly line and general ambience of the hotel the rooms are very small we had trouble fitting   suitcases in the price is fairly high even by london s standards and breakfast was extra the location is excellent direct route from the airport at heathrow the hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar the street is quiet a good hotel if travelling on business the room is a little small and the decor is dated the staff were superb very helpful and friendly the hotel is in an excellent position close to the underground station and easy to get to the room was very clean and well serviced each day air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples the location was excellent   mins from tube and walkable to several locations kensington palace albert hall knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile we received a complimentary upgrade on the room bed was lovely and comfortable hotel was lovely staff friendly and attentive as is just off main road nice and quiet can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need i always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes i would you ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why lovely hotel for a special occasion we needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe the toasts were but nothing else not the table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together potato cakes had gluten including flours they seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food we had gluten free breakfast they had separate toaster for gluten free breads but i can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet otherwise i can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast i just could not eat it still for sure i could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast enough for a big man it was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms friendly stuff clean location breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great perfect location close to all transports nice and clean hotel friendly staff and a really nice garden the area was nice and quiet rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean i absolutely love this hotel the staff is great the rooms are small but comfortable the location cannot be beat this hotel is a   min walk to the tube station and from there you can get anywhere you need to go bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in location for tube and central london plus some nice restaurants close by too staff were very pleasant breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too the wifi is only  kb s which isn t fast by today s standards the power socket near the bed was loosen i can t charge my phone generally it s a wonderful experience the hotel is within walking distance of earl s court station very convenient location there re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel the staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman the room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases the tv is new and major english tv programs are provided mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so i can make some tea complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided the cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found bath towels and amenities are changed everyday the surrounding area is safe to hang around during night it costs only around   pounds per night which is a good deal no negative the breakfast was perfect very clean parking was easy to reach and available even we left the hotel one night to go to leeds very kind of the hotel we were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a   star room how ever it was clean and bed was comfortable the location is definitely the main selling point wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using chrome breakfast coffee was only average good quality breakfast food friendly and efficient staff we choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was     th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive the room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open staff was very friendly and helpful the location was great the room was very quiet not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular great location with very easy access to public transport and popular location major shopping streets walkable a very comfortable hotel top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath lethal combination for the elderly or children second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated front desk staff very dismissive beds very comfortable pleasant and necessary lounge area off reception with excellent bar staff area good for restaurants the breakfast staff were not helpful when we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about   minutes to be seated they forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table after   minutes we were finally seated i was so upset i did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment we won t be back staff were courteous and helpfulno negative location is excellent and easy to get into central london and choice of local restaurants fab staff at the hotel are friendly and accommodating rooms are spacious very comfortable and clean breakfast options excellent and bar area very comfortable and cosy big plus is underground parking at the hotel also fab experience all round couldn t work out how to crank down the heating in the room bathroom is miniscule mini bar was very limited with its choice good sized room for the price and wonderfully located having its own bar and restaurant on site was a bonus despite there being countless foodie drinkie options outside their doors no negative excellent location near major railway lines easy to get from the airport friendly and helpful staff a homely atmosphere and personal attention highly recommended breakfast is expensive especially when i have already paid over   for a standard room per night location for central london is perfect hotel is very clean mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords also it would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a   euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions when we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith very good location restaurants and supermarkets around and the clineanliness of the hotel the only thing i can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her teddybears   clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table the underground is only a   minute walk so getting around was very easy i am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it no negative i especially liked my room s well operating walk in non slip shower and bathroom an amenity not always found in other london hotels i also liked the comfortable bed the size of room the good elevators lifts and the proximity to earl s court tube buses cafes shops and atms no negative thank you k k hotel george at earl s court you assured our stay in london was fun and despite some snow cozy and pleasant thank you for accommodating our every need from booking theatre tickets to providing cutlery for our take away even letting us borrow the hdmi cable from the business centre everyone is so knowledgeable and helpful and kind cannot wait try your other locations thank you again kkhotelgeorge kkhotelgeorge i had to ask at breakfast all   mornings we were there for coffee and re fills i think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea very good location for tube station and getting around all the sights and shows we had pre booked my one complaint is the overly soft mattresses it was not good for my back friendly helpful staff the facilities are good including the bar the earl s court tube station is just a few steps away and this station has access to several useful lines for what you get the prices are reasonable very nice breakfast buffet the mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft i had a neck ache the next morning the room was super tiny we stayed at the hilton bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison the location was just     minutes from earl s court paul s was also opposite the underground station making it very convenient to pop by for breakfast excellent espresso cappucino and freshly baked pastries by the way before heading off for sightseeing temperature in the room was difficult to regulate the staff are really helpful and accommodating nothing was too much trouble the hotel is very pretty in a great location with a cosy bar area i have stayed here several times and will definitely stay again i don t know if it was because i booked through booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place underground with no view unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as i should have done it on check in i didn t know what i was going to be doing on check in tea and biscuits not replenished the second day the location really nothing this was a perfect choice the entire staff were friendly courteous and helpful the room was clean and quiet and the breakfast was excellent as was the location   minute walk to the underground tube just perfect rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters gym is open from     pm to    pm when you usually are out location heated outdoor smoking area breakfast is good just   min walk to earls court station halal restaurants are very close by soiled chair in room pillows not clean shower temp control very sensitive in  st room we stayed in value for money helpful friendly staff good locationno negative excellent hotel in every aspect fantastic location with only a     minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central london rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom all the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone we asked for   singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation there were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work to be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so comfy bed a lovely warm room with good facilities on a cold damp london day great shower nice toiletries and fab fluffy towels would stay again as it was a great location the things we didn t like weren t the end of the world and we enjoyed our stay no iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about location fantastic   minute walk to earl court tube shops and restaurants beautiful building with parking did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much loo very low lucky i am only  ft   delicious english breakfast staff very helpful and pleasant staff not particularly helpful have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this   times breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a   rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm its in the right area for what we need housekeeping missed my room one day and although i did not make much of a fuss over it i did not get a convincing explanation i did get an apology though english breakfast everyday was a welcome bonus bar is not impressive but well run kudos to mariusz who looked after me room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited overallthe hotel was worth themoney and really handy for the tube good local pub for a great breakfast bathroom is really small great location near the underground   breakfast room size consider good when compared to london hotels super fast wifi staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what i asked for i requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin so was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed i was advised i had been upgraded this was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the tv was much smaller clearly not an upgrade i don t know i guess for   i was expecting a lot more for a   night stay on checking in i was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate i didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately and not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter appreciate i had arrived  mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset location was pretty good with decent restaurants in walking distance wifi did the job range of tv channels shower was lovely weird atmosphere in reception many eastern european staff room cold and uninspiring   per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water overpriced overall location near earls court tube stop front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission he tried to net an extra   on my bill with the horrible exchange rate when i caught it he told me i must have authorized it at check in which i had not completely unacceptable good english breakfast the towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations staff on the front desk we re very welcoming the gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym very short walk from the tube but not on the main road ideal location two years in a row we checked in for   days on booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the  pm check in time no effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room last year our friends from the midlands arrived for a   night stay while we were there and at  am sharp their room was ready and they got in let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night who do you take care of location location location and breakfast saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening wonderful bed impeccably clean room staff are very helpful and polite the air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc our room on the  th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about   m  comfortable beds quality breakfast nice and helpful staff short walk to the tube the bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days i stayed for   nights the cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them they also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them the location the room was a little bigger for the usual london hotel room the staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel they provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic i enjoyed my stay overall it was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room   if it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy comfortable bed the heating was not working in the room for the first two days very well kept hotel with a lovely garden staff particularly friendly and professional a very nice room i think this may be a london thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot in our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower very dated apart from the tv if like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would i stay again not if it was free is the answer the location was good on a quiet street about   meters from the earls court tube and buses close to some nice restaurants and pubs for breakfast lunch or dinner noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional very comfortable beds well lit room bathroom compact but worked well the staff were all polite and helpful good gardens and quiet location the room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight the staff are friendly and kindly to help our room is not in the basement and it s clean especially the bathroom which we care most briefly it s a good hotel in this price we ll choose to stay again next time i can t think of a thing that needed improved upon all aspects of my stay were excellent stayed in room   comfy bed and pillows quiet room facing lovely garden super clean and neat good size flat screen tv with lots of channels staff wonderfully helpful food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants two minute walk from earl s court tube also every convenience a traveler could want located right on earl s court road several bank atms pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even america fast food if you need your fix mcdonald s burger king kfc and starbucks there s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry i always remind my fellow americans who are not used to european hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to us standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank far higher in my opinion than wasted floor space definitely not a   star hotel triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion except for the reception ladies staff very rude definitely not reccomended being in london in the same area several times and there are definitely better real   stars the position of the hotel was very close to earl s court tube stationno negative the location was perfect stones through away from earls court station staff were all lovely and accommodating gardens were lovely cracking thai restaurant round the corner too rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy we didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until  pm for people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest very small room dated interior the cleaning could improve my room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed the bed was loosing boards underneath it the staff was helpful and friendly the lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant it is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help bed linen is so cozy lovely breakfast super showers and staff are great and friendly there is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in october so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep air con at this time of the year is opening the windows location excellent staff very helpful we only stayed   nights the location was perfect close to the underground restaurants etc yet quiet the food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful the staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful the room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden perfect conclusion to our   week stay in the ukno negative this is the second k k hotel i stayed at the other was in barcelona it s a great boutique hotel the hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside you re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for london would definitely stay here again there was nothing that we can think of the room key is very large and there is only one they ask that you turn it in when you go out it s a little eccentric but ok it was small but comfortable and very quiet the garden was beautiful breakfast was very good staff was friendly and helpful it is located only two blocks from the tube there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room   no positive the room was really really cold the heating didn t work i was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference this led to a really bad nights sleep quiet roomno negative k k is a heath hotel that can a person stay on i like it a lot i get a beautiful welcome i think to come next year with my family and thank you for all thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy no scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs should be constantly monitored this is a deceptively large and busy hotel i requested somewhere within close walking distance to olympia   min walk is not that close staff great friendly acomodating in particular reception staff and bar man wednesday night you can open a bedroom window the bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot the mattress was orthopaedic firm staff were very helpful breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements long periods without eggs etc very limited selection of vegetables and salad would probably expect better breakfast from a   star place very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys only a short walk to nearest subway nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff nice breakfast restaurant will come back again don t believe there was anything we didn t like my personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but i was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint the hotel is incredibly handy to earl s court station we loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet g t at the end of each hectic day in london we ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located there was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing we ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well personally i think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin excellent location you have the access to earl s court underground within   minutes walk district and piccadilly lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially heathrow without any transfer many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than   person a table for brochures also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc these were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors house keeping quality and service very good even folded our clothes breakfast was unbelievable you even had stewed prunes first floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks liked the breakfast being made available with room price obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also would consider staying here again no negative although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city nothing could have been better honestly and i m very critical and picky i love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street the breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious the rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you the whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive west end hotel but with a cosy feel to it it s my favourite hotel in london and i ve stayed in quite a few no negative this is the second time i stay in this hotel it s clean and bed is calling my comfortable also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarketsno negative close to city center  mins away from tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast it took them   days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to   different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there againno positive the breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning it would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining we would have been happy to pay for it too instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day we noticed many guests doing the same this hotel was a great value near the tube station in earl s court it was one of the few places in london that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter it was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything there was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring why carp when there is nothing to carp about staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service breakfast buffet is first rate easy access to rest of london esp old brompton road and knotting hill the official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like i did location is very useful for heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight the place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good the room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open it was very hot in london while i was there so it wasn t really under their control great location easy transportation to everything walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores room was very quiet and comfortable the atm machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress the breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated we especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled great taxi service was provided when requested the bathroom was cramped it was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily the shower spilled water out all over the floor there was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction the breakfast was very disappointing it was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar we had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well i also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked the bacon was quite watery the selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better the beds and decor were nice it was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night we chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night we had a fantastic stay at the k k george very easy access to earls court tube which goes straight to heathrow as well as being a great start to explore london easily quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in room was very comfortable and well serviced breakfast had lots of choice really a lovely base for a holiday in london bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs location close to some shops and restaurants only   minutes walk underground   minutes walk polite and assistive staff room space is good nothing really a lower price is always good of course excellent location quiet but easy access to transport quiet room plenty big enough very clean with attractive garden views very good breakfast friendly and helpful staff would be very happy to stay there again wifi was a bit slow location was excellent as it was very close to earls court station and to the main high street staff were friendly and breakfast was really good we were given the executive room which has direct access to the beautiful garden my whole family loved this hotel and for sure will book it again when i travel to london housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue great food very nice bar staff ex suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before the temperature of the room could not be lower than   degrees which wasn t cool enough no positive the bathroom is on the smaller side excellent location on a quiet street just around the corner from earl s court tube station easy acess from heathrow airport   minutes by underground a garden at the back adds great value on a summer s day the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold it is a smart comfortable hotel and our room was quiet which was something i specifically asked for but room was small but adequate there was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though i put some paper on it to indicate its existence fire alarm went off at   am and we were all in the street for a while all was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation a lovely choice at breakfast with freshly cooked food staff were pleasant and helpful good late checkout time fire alarm and semi evacuation at   am little or no direction by staff reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear no subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident convenient location for our purpose clean and comfortable rooms the room it was fairly small it wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central london shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either lovely hotel great location for earls court tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of london sightseeing and very quiet we had a great sleep both nights nothing really very comfy beds and helpful staff easy walk to the tube station price we secured was very good access to computers and printers very helpful our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke the blackout blind didn t work very well the hotel and the rooms were very nicely presented clean and functional beds were very comfortable nothing beautifully kept large sized garden with separate areas for sitting for drinks afternoon tea beautiful view of garden from room very nicely appointed with fresh modern decor in lobby lounge and rooms no problems at all with a small pet very convenient to well connected earls court tube station air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead well located very clean and good sized rooms bar food and breakfast was excellent staff very friendly and helpful definitely stay again they weren t inexpensive the room was clean the buffet offered plenty of variety and the staff couldn t have been better leann in particular stood out but everyone was eager to please knowledgeable and responsive farthest room from elevator uncomfortable bed air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room staff were not interested when told about it we did not sleep well because of it no positive room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking location very convenient to tube nice garden area to sit in after a long day breakfast buffet was very niceno negative conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street very quiet since it s in a back lane nice view from the fifth floor cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic air con did not work so called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge we have been here many times but the added cost over   a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal like the location as i chose it myself breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable bed very comfy room was really tiny and i don t think was good value for money but i would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel everything except the space in the room tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving the old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early   s but not anymore and would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a   per night room instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink the beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious the staff are polite and helpful small room some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options great selection for breakfast buffet hotel location great near earls court tube station loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage hotel has a bar high is convenientno negative we had a lovely stay at k k the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful when we arrived at     am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the wellness center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until  pm that really saved the day and we had an amazing day in london wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired excellent staff breakfast was great with a good choice room very comfortable location is brilliant and there is very little street noise no negative the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming the bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business i didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there the location to the tube was excellent rigid rules our plane arrives in the morning so i requested early check in in the booking acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel we arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone i started with good morning i know it s too early but i wonder if you ve got a room for us i booked   rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport he replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at  pm leave you baggage over there he then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more the tags are in pairs   to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining   pairs to me as i realised it was self service i did the   bags by myself and before i could finish he already rushed me to take my tags i can t believe he could be so rude we brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out we were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around  nn by then we were offered   room i saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and i am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already i let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard my bf and i waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them we waited till  pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though i requested for it when i made the booking and no reply as well and during the check in i had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info i have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself i understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way location is good   mins to earl s court station loads of restaurants nearby tranquil neighbourhood clean free printing stable wifi took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying very comfortable beds very quiet despite facing the street excellent breakfast great location friendly staff close to good restaurants and pubs not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid aside from that the hotel was lovely room was basic for the price we paid it was very hot in the room and not very much room in the bathroom spotlessly clean and good location its a hit and miss with the reception staff sometimes i got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained the restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly i love the location and working wi fi the double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate the breakfast was excellent the garden at the back of the hotel was superb the children could run around let off steam whilst we had a drink in the garden the staff were very friendly excellent location no negative the room was compact but bright and nicely decorated staff very friendly and helpful peaceful street but very close to earl s court tube would stay there again occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or   floor above quite disturbing expensive good location in earls court quiet and comfortable the size of the room is small for americans but pretty standard for europe the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid  pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious the price for breakfast is a little high i liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot let me think about it nothing really perfect location in south west london very serene and close to the tube station about   meters many restaurants around and nice walk to hyde park very clean and decent place the restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing the room was spacious and very clean and the location meant it was incredibly easy for us to get about on the underground i can t think of a single thing refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds we had the classic twin which like most london hotels was small but adequate we suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet location is great as only a block away from the tube with the picadilly line leading direct to covent garden and the theatres having stayed here a few times before i thought i would have a pleasant stay as usual i was wrong for a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way those used to be good in this hotel not when i visited this time i ll look for somewhere else for my next trip no positive the toilet was too low to the floor the room was much too hot and the windows did not open the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely all very clean there was nothing in the mini fridge it was empty i would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service the bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby the staff was friendly and helpful the printing center was also very convenient the toilet is slightly small though it contains everything the floor is wooden so you could hear people walking it will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep but for travellers just coming to london this does not count unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized the location is great which is only   munites walk from earl s court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around the room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in london it only takes about   munites going from heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in london not very early i will definitely prefer this hotel next time the rooms were extremely small i don t think the breakfast was good value for money loved the location so easy to access the subway and coffee shops and restuarantsno negative great location just round the corner from earls court station easy access to all main attractions comfy room breakfast excellent choice staff very friendly would definately stay again on our next trip to london the room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows very helpful staff willing to help great breakfast and not rushed away as could sit and chat over breakfast great choice of food in pleasant dining room wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great this is an excellent hotel location is amazing just minutes from earl s court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the city we could easily walk to kensington high street hyde park natural history museum etc excellent shower phenomenal water pressure room was clean bed was very comfortable staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants breakfast was very good the hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out we will be back room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room bathroom very small and toilet very low good location parking available although quite expensive close to subway no negative staff are always joyful and helpful we were under booked totally my fault by   day and on site manager extended our stay in the same room for another thanks for that and also guiding us to the pick up point for our tour of highclare castle so kind of all of your staff thanks doug pat brugger no water to drink in spa area room on small side compared to advertised twin room kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in excellent breakfast could open window in bedroom was quiet outside for london lovely to have a garden great mini spa after hectic city no negative reception area appealing check in and out quick bedroom good size nice and light lovely view of hotel garden bed extremely comfortable and experienced a good few nights sleep did not experience any noise disturbance excellent choices for breakfast very enjoyable staff very helpful providing us with information and travel advice breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne now more english breakfast which means the cost is pricey at   pounds wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times location very convenient walking distance to tube station room clean and comfortable size staff very friendly in hotel the bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom there is a lack of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless the parking is very reasonable for central london the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is great no negatives quiet position but close to tube station only two stops to major museums staff friendly and efficient room very clean and comfortable excellent breakfast rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy the location is perfect close to the tube around the corner great breakfast and good value my room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling i arrived early in the morning after a long trip from africa i was able to take a shower and change clothes in the wellness centre which made the day fo me perfect for   nights in transit between a long journey from africa and a really long journey to nz quiet yet less than   minute walk to piccadilly line at earl s court even dragging heavy suitcase the bathrooms ar very small but everything you need is there they were also spotless great location very clean great breakfasts nice big towels that were changed every day comfortable beds internet worked well also a plus that the guests have access to a computer internet with a printer in the lobby serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always   coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time good spacious enough room and bathroom excellent location near earl s court underground station very nice breakfast buffet very good internet facilities with printer access even very nice garden with seating facilities no negative my go to place when in london this was my  th stay great location within walking distance from earl s court underground station piccadilly line from heathrow staff is friendly rooms are up to date and clean nothing we loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport above good location put us next to a smoking room and two of us asmathic staff were so rude when we brought it up they eventually moved us to a new room which was a massive downgrade and one of us had to sleep on a camp bed no apology was offered bathroom a bit small brilliant location hotel comfortable and clean staff very friendly and helpful lovely view over london from our  th floor room breakfast excellent lovely garden wouldn t hesitate to stay here again and recommend it very good value for money room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there great location   minutes from earl s court tube station nice room great shower good value for price breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians great location and parking delivered wine to celebrate my wife birthday thankyou things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking have stayed here before very comfortable good showers good breakfast breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive decent selection however of food attended the chelsea v psg game and opted to stay here after a great stay a few weeks ago had a free upgrade which was a lovely surprise parking was handy and safe but quite expensive the view from our room was lovely the breakfast was very tasty with plenty of choices and the easy location with the tube ride into leicester square just one stop away superb the bathroom was tiny and the pillows a bit lumpy but nothing terrible we stayed as a family to do a couple of days sightseeing hotel was in a good area for getting around close to tube and with an underground car park rooms comfy good breakfast and a nice bar shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction great selection at breakfast extra comfortable beds and linen great price through booking com nothing could have been better it was perfect never slept in such a restful bed the duvet and pillow were like sleeping in a cloud breakfast was full of flavour with good quality produce and plenty of variety cooked breakfast not very imaginative too small plates can t cook eggs room not as big as i hoped for in exec room king size bed good bed clean the room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season the hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing that is almost a fraud the breakfast is not nearly what it used to be it was okay but not a reason to come any more the location still is a reason location just first class in many ways room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows breakfast is excellent good choice and offer porridge which is always a bonus staff recognised that we had stayed before and welcomed us back waiting staff at breakfast were very attentive bath towels were beautifully white and fluffy bed comfy and the room was spotless the room had a beautiful view of the gardens this is why we came back nothing at all everything great location underground around the corner we had a room on the street side and it was very quiet fantastic breakfast friendly staff beautiful room the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back the breakfast was the best buffet breakfast we have had everything hot and plenty of choice it was great to have water and fruit in the room a nice touch the bedding was lovely duvet really snuggly the pull out mirror in the bathroom really useful the bathroom is quite small but did have a tub the location the tea kettle the cosmetics quality linens nice neighborhood attractive bar and lobby fitness looked small but fine staff smiling try the blackbird pub in front of the station to the right wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in   to dont provide proper wifi had to work from the toilet where the signal was here clean price is correct the only bad thing i can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small not much space to move very helpful staff all premises were kept really clean a very good breakfast and you can eat all you can the garden at the bakc of the building really nice if the weather is good room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in london and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand the hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on saturday our room was not ready on time having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one conscientious staff who worked hard to make our stay a pleasant one room and hotel was clean and well presented good location near the tube for the museums double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside but then this is a london old hotel very helpful staff great choice of food at breakfast clean and recently refurbished close to underground station insufficient uk power points for a couple on business without requesting uk adaptors breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot gym could do with an update room was a little too compact great secluded garden would be fantastic in summer very helpful and friendly staff bed room comfortable and very quiet dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there very littleno negative excellent base for short visits to london v good breakfast charming garden well maintained and equipped if small rooms tube station   mins walk very definitely the breakfast fruit selection limited very little input from staff many   star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table the fried eggs were dry and inedible they clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished the outlook on to the garden was lovely beds very comfy the room for   person are not very big and another very bad surprise is with booking hotel i made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused the location is very good in near the subway the staff and breakfast are excellent bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit very nice staff and comfortable and quiet room very friendly welcome and very helpful desk staff no negative fine hotel very clean great breakfast and nice bar staff very helpful access to pc and printer proper access even from iphone very close to tube station highly recommended my only thing i would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited i am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything i liked however the breakfast was lovely the room was great i couldn t ask for a better night sleep the sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities staff were excellent very friendly and helpful we had a problem develop with the toilet running water and it was resolved within half hour of being reported very efficient service in all areas nothing the location was great on the picadilly line so very easy to get to central london and heathrow the staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable really enjoyed the stay thin wall can hear everything on the hallway i would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by great location good breakfast clean and modern hotel some mentioned the rooms to be tiny but i thought it was a good size room for london room got a bit cold but the heater in the room worked really well unlike some of the reviews i read also the front desk called to check in and see if the room was alright nice touch of customer service worst nights sleep in a long long time pillows were awful gave me a bad neck couldn t turn the heating off i barely slept due to how hot it was bathroom was absolutely stifling no positive first night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel requested a fan for our room but did not receive one cleanliness efficiency and ease of location comparatively quiet to other hotels i ve stayed at in london too front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us the scrambled eggs did not taste good at all very buttery and watery the breakfast buffet had a good selection nothing could have been better this is one of if not the best hotels i ve stayed in for it s attention to detail this is a perfect hotel i loved the huge fluffy towels comfortable be soft pillows perfect breakfast free newspapers the staff and the free newspaper the location is superb no negative often the reality is different from the website but in the case of hotel george the photos really did portray reality i could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel i chose this hotel because the average review was amazing this was spot on it s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked who could want for more a little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in excellent location and very welcoming staff great to spend a couple of nights at one of the most desirable postcodes in the country rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was coldno positive room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down amazing location great value for money staff friendly and helpful and breakfast delicious no negative location was absolutely perfect just round the corner from earl s court tube station but not at all noisy room was spacious and offered really good value for money bed in room   was appalling and needs replacement to compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means i was not the first to complain location and staff old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small comfortable rooms and fluffy towels and plenty of them good to have a bath after a long day very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied   yards to olympia it was not pleasant bar area food good clean bathroom bed is too hard pillows were horrible ac didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi wouldn t recommend it at all location and the staff were friendly the bathroom was far too small for an executive room the key of my room did not work properly very good location nice quiet neighbourhood friendly staff and good breakfast breakfast times could start earlier mon friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff wi fi speed extremely slow the bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest     for a pint of larger is a little extreme reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them new management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its   rating for long comfortable hotel in convenient location didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available we were lucky to have a space will book in future close to underground station but in a quiet location staff were excellent pleasant and helpful good choice for breakfast the bed was so comfortable we didn t want to get up nothing most value for money staffs are very friendly and nice location is great actually i booked   hotels during this trip i think k k is most valuable absolutely will book again on next trip no negative quiet location nice staff especially jose and svietlana good breakfast what more a little bit small bathroom not a big problem for me unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom the hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning i was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it i stayed for one night and the hotel is beautiful in a great location staff were very nice lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open good location nice friendly staff the hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like ikea the gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails the hotel is clean in good location the breakfast wasn t bad the room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat the staff were very obliging and provided a good service restaurant looks out onto a well kept garden which would be lovely in summer rooms could have been a bit bigger design and decor dated all clean and well maintained staff excellent ideal location for our visit to the albrt hall nothing very close to underground very close to shops and restaurants quiet location very nice modern hotel even with a garden breakfast was very goodno negative very comfortable double room excellent breakfast very courteous and helpful staff very close to the tube many good restaurants in the area walking distance nothing really important good breakfast free wi fi good bar lovely room with a nice view to the hotel s garden great bathroom with a very good shower excellent locationno negative easy to get to from the tube station staff friendly room was clean the location was quiet hotel was well presented good bars and restuarants within walking distance room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards you can hear it clearly every time someone uses it definitely ask for a room away from one there is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard the pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station friendly hotel staff clean room and bathroom with nice big shower no negative a boutique style hotel it had a lovely garden nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use complimentary fresh fruit plate for us the breakfast was superb gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates quiet location but within minutes of bustle a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light very nice staff at the front desk this was my sixth visit in k k hotel george i brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast there was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy near earl s court metrostation really easy to reach staff was very friendly no negative very good continental breakfast excellent location close to earls court tube station the k and k has a very good value and totally refurbished i really recommend it the room was small and very warm even with air conditioning it was situated beside the lift even though i requested a quiet room the bathroom was even smaller the hotel is located only a   minute walk from earls court tube and situated on a quiet street staff are welcoming friendly and knowledgeable the hotel and room was spotless breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of both continental and english room a little on the small side though perfect for one person food in room service could have been a little more interesting good coffee though excellent location helpful staff comfortable room heated bathroom floor and lovely towels nice and big room was adjacent to staircase on  th fnloor sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast style breakfast bar meals great staff small rooms perfect location great value very comfortable beds we arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great nice lobby right next to earls court tube stop so plenty of travel links tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area english breakfast was not too good and a little cold however they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the english and there was plenty of choice lovely hotel with friendly staff very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating we had a room overlooking the garden which was nice excellent location would definitely stay here again the room little bit small but for couple is enough in london you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok there is no air condition in the room or it was not working it was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in january the price per night is very good relatively to other   stars hotels in london the location is very good   minutes walk from earl s court metro station at piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in london direct from the heathrow airport and to all the popular locations in london near the hotel there is   big supermarket     good restaurants and   cafes the hotel very clean modern and new the breakfast very good not too expensive for full english breakfast   per person at any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more the bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean this is my second time i m staying in the k k hotels in europe they are very good bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for london hotels great location really near to earls court tube station and restaurants friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds nice hotel with modern touches definitely stay again no negative very convenient location for earl s court tube station warm welcome from reception staff good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon i filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed on arrival no reserved parking place because i only made a request lousy no wifi on  th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home location smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better excellent location for the price less than   mins walking to earl s court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the piccadilly line good breakfast prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again the staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill   metres and down   metres down its a accident waiting to happen the standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room we really appreciated that because we were going to spend   days in that hotel but even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all london hotels the room did not have central heating it was december and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold when we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold as in all london central hotels this hotel is also not value for money if it were say in munich or milan it definitely would be half this price its central location its proximity to metro station   min walk to earl s court underground station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides only one luft was in operation during peak season single room was quite small double rooms looked larger everything a boutique hotel should be well located on a quiet side street   minute walk to earls court station tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design really impressive my single room was quite small but well laid out i will go back liked it the best of   hotels i ve stayed in london see above tangent staff were indifferent and sullen i was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience i left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on   seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping i got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and i never heard from them about my items ever they also gave me a   year old folding cot bed with a   mattress to sleep on for   nights i would have thought   plus for   nights would have afforded me a bed yes i complained and they relented eventually although the location is fantasticly placed i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away i booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night the booking was made within   hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed when i arrived they insisted i pay for the canceled booking i should have just walked away but thought i could resolve it they were rude and steadfast in insisting i pay for the canceled night i contacted booking com to help resolve the situation booking com were very helpful recognized i had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue the hotel blankly refused not very nice people at all i would never stay again no positive we were promised the same room we had we left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator there was no division between the double bed and the single bed i had to insist they give us another room the manager did not want to go out of her way even though i insisted i finally said i would write a letter she gave us a double and single on a higher floor no positive breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the  nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds it was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean   didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in     had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited   minutes   too warm bar area and reception goodno negative we love everything about the hotel george the location the facilities the staff and as this was our  th stay in   years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been   i think that speaks for itself on my previous visit i had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel when i arrived there was a denial that i had made a booking this was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom i had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the  th dec   days after my original stay however my booking had been made with booking com on the  th dec so one way or another someone cocked up but i was blamed for the failure in their communication poor show on this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny the d cor was ok perhaps functional is an apt description there was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to earls court station was ideal no negative i went to london to visit my niece who was studying in london this hotel was ideally located in earl s court close to her apartment and the tube station very nice hotel and staff nice selection of food at breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at earl s court the website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic the parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail the bathroom was tiny room was ok if a little small and this was a king executive tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable i requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated room was small bathroom very small breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning coffee and tea not up to standard breakfast buffet was good location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden i like the fact that it is a small hotel plus i like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast they told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for   not   they know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast on the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station we were told   minutes to liverpool street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it we had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day the fare quoted was   we were charged   and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in   minutes i have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply very disappointed overall location staff and cleanliness attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out bathroom although clean was dated a bit  s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid i didn t realise this still happened in london great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like austrian apple strudel the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of     it was a private firm and not a london black cab although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke not pleasant good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom excellent choice of food at breakfast the bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire one of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife the rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful   minutes from earl s court tube hotel has everything you would want in london good breakfast comfortable room free wifi that works we had no ventilation in bathroom the location is superb close to central and all shopping areas as well as restaurants our room was good size very comfy excellent breakfast with big variety vegetarian and vegan options and bubbly the beds quite small room we asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room it was hidden in the cupboard the location the view from room   nice breakfast room with excellent breakfast and a nice view to the garden coffee and tea in room nothing the hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of earls court very friendly staff delicious breakfast we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely been before had a very good stay small rooms but very tidy room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours well connected and quite location great breakfast service and stuff room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot location excellent tube is close by so travel is easy breakfast excellent staff friendly rooms spotless bed was so soft and comfy nothing it s perfect excellent location   minutes to earl s court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from the first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory the view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor the place is nice and the breakfast is very good it was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option it s a hotel needs little updating continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the   days we stayed room wi fi was so so location near earls court underground was great newspapers and tv stations were good view of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room no bad experiences at all there was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel our room was very comfortable and a good size for a london hotel it was clean tidy and well equipped the staff were first class they were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot the breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality we will certainly pay a return visit no negative beautiful hotel great location friendly helpful staff good breakfast included in the price loved the help yourself nescafe in the lobby while waiting for breakfast thank you very expensive would not have stayed except meeting us family at same hotel i trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which i stood on as i got into bed staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning shows room had not been properly cleaned unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair room was tiny and not good value for money location for us was important main public areas high standard and parking a bonus parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items breakfast tea was not a brand to savour left it after a sip some guests had also left items uncovered e g cheese selection and flies were enjoying these there was a timid fox in the garden although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk mobile coverage seemed to be poor and wifi alleviated issues to some extent great location great amenities transport links rooms had all key requirements staff helpful nothing the bath was huge and the location was really good near the tube but outside the congestion zone with a good car parkno negative the location is great you can find all what you need int that area close to the u derground the hotel is nice clean with a friendly staff keys for the rooms and system of opening doors water in the shower kept changing temperatures constantly location size of room and comfort of bed the breads at breakfast were not as fresh as i thought they should be having said that the range of choice was excellentno positive i ordered aroom on the second or third floor and got on the ground also orderd an executive room and got standard no positive the bathroom was extremely small the room was lovely clean and the beds were very comfortable it was also great to have the garden difficult to find anything that we didn t like the location the outlook of the hotel friendliness of the staff we will returnno negative very clean comfy hotel good value at   a night in london great location for earls court royal albert hall and tube thin walls could hear the tv next door quite loudly but not enough to complain location was excellent as we re the staff we ordered a room for   adults the room was a   person room with a horribel extra bed not made for adults and caused painful nights no positive expense for meals the location and the easy travelling to where we needed to be as we were in london for a purpose not a holiday the staircase at the entrance inconvenience for the huge luggage n not suitable for elderly the breakfast is thumbs up with its variety n quality no negative the staff were efficient and friendly and the room was clean i chose the hotel based on its cleanliness rating and wasn t disappointed upgraded to executive king size room not an executive room in my opinion very basic appears to be more suited to business clients great location loved it all we enjoyed the little extras eg tissue box set in marble under the sink washing line discreetly fixed over bath etc breakfast not quite as good as it used to be it used to be what set this hotel apart from its competitors good attentive staff during previous stays it was nice to have a glass of champagne from the breakfast buffet we missed it this time good location and private parking wifi is as always in london bit of pain due to lower and unstable bitrate excellent staff and great welcome to the hotel after checkinno negative the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood very close to the earl s court tube station great breakfast very nice staff clean and comfotableno negative the k k hotel is always maintained and staffed to a high standard we ve been going back there for many years now and always enjoy our stay no negative all the staff where very friendly and helpful the food was excellent and a great choice the rooms where lovely as well no negative nice hotel with a wonderful backyard good location as it is close to subway in a residential area restaurants close by the matress is not very comfortable and the bathroom is small even i had a king executive room position of the hotel wifi and breakfastno negative responsive staff excellent room terrific breakfast and located conveniently to tube a bit pricey but service food and comfort all exceptional difficult to locate the phone to contact reception lack toilet itineraries and it was difficult to locate these they have followed through special requests comfortable bed wide choices for breakfast and very clean air con not great great location and very comfortable rooms room was available for early check in easy walk to attractions and trains for onward journey not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a   off voucher i would have been very annoyed if i had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal we had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable no parking on site we parked about     mile away but it s expensive parking from     friday until    am sunday cost     although reasonable by london standards it s an added expense for a weekend away perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks restaurant expensive given the quality of food standard rooms are very comfortable good central location no negative very large room hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful short walk to public transport blackfriars tube station and temple station we have been charged for room service that we did not have i spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of     issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed this has not been done location and room excellent it would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel guest svc manager francesco was very helpful with our questions on places to go and ways to get there room bed was extremely comfortable and good sized bathroom was also a good sized bathroom with a long bath and a cute apex duck a very cute and novel idea every thing was excellent apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at   am by staff walking in room when i mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered room was great bathroom was immaculately clean no problems at all room and bathroom excellent really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower tv ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room hotel looks new so all furnishings modern tube a short walk away we walked to the theatre district in around     minutes we did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by i would certainly recommend this hotel no negative staff really friendly bed was extremely comfy and not too far from two underground stations the concierge recommended a great italian on fleet street and booked a table for two in minutes overall great stay no negative we were very pleased with the hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors not a lot to put in this section if i was going to be very picky i d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad wine list could be improved room was clean and well appointed location was great for sight seeing being set back from the road our room was quiet a most enjoyable stay meals very plain no extras or garnishes restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable cold croissants for breakfast nice room modern and cool bar space in lobby very cosy no toothbrush provided being new in this area the conceierge service is excellent special thanks to mr francis who was on duty and helped my colleague and myself several times throughout our stay nothing brilliant location so close to the tube room was gorgeous and spacious lovely and modern the hotel was quiet and so so clean loved it really made our stay extra relaxing the shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra   pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and   bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area the wi fi was rather terrible my husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine and since i did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip i was relying on wi fi to communicate while in london thankfully there were other locations around the city where i could connect to the wi fi the location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the underground tube we also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district there were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice the staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly they also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them the only thing i d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows we were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite as part of that you get access to the club lounge the room was lovely looked as new comfy bed very clean and the club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available  hrs the staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation the view from the hotel was quite uninspiring easy to reach covent garden soho and city however the hotel is quite far away from westminster room is clean comfy and nicely designed very nice couch good bathno negative book a room that comes with access to the club lounge the club lounge offers a continental breakfast free water soda wine and beer throughout the day and sandwiches and fruit during the afternoon the coffee machine makes the best lattes along with a variety of other types of coffees and hot chocolate this lounge really made the stay for us breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary a la carte was also possible but we didn t try although it s a fairly big hotel the overall vibe we got was very cozy which we liked a lot staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we needed upon arrival we received a reduction coupon for the breakfast the location is exquisite more seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets very clean large rooms with high value toiletries extremely comfortable bed and pillows friendly staff no negative this is without question one of london finest hotels i have never slept that well in a very very longtime and i love the duck amazing reception and great facilities no negative great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody the cleaner knocked on our door at  am which wasn t ideal we were checking out that day so no need to clean the room being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic the room and bed were extremely comfortable excellent personalised service food was excellent this was my second time at this hotel the first time i booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room i was given this time i opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room i had stayed in before it just might be that i was given a free upgrade the first time no positive going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings they were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building the design facilities and location of the hotel wifi and also gym were quite convenient some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed very clean and lovely bathroom too a few more little milks maybe as i drink a lot of tea but i was given a little jug of milk when i asked the bathroom was light pleasant and very clean the wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities the bed was comfortable the air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive a lot better value for money in other hotels the room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious nothing your doing a fantastic job just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court where to start from the amazing upgrade for my husbands  th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start the hotel is in a great location less than   minutes walk to covent garden and for location alone is great value i had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner it s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the london eye the apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans pringles and of course the apex duck we had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay they really have thought about everything we have stayed in many hotels in london but would definately choose apex again the rooms were too dark and warm after shaving i got on a plane and realized i missed half my face the bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet the bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room it was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room the walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories one should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast the staff were from anywhere else but britain which did not help make our british experience any better it was located in a cosy corner off the street if we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different literally could not find fault with anything the staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely location was fine for where i needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and covent garden depends what you looking for underground is about   mins walk in either direction very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet i imagine very pleasant staff and good hotel bar i didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment at the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent we felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another   to price of our stay the location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket the room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive but understand i wasn t paying for a view the staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly the shower and bath were fantastic bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm good location to walk around london not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not eu compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little bose speaker have the old iphone   connector nice bathroom with big shower and bath quiet if you get a room on the top floors no negative i spend the weekend in the apex hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london for this thank you so much we will come back best regards theresa breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on fleet street rooms are quiet beds are huge bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful location is very good thames within walking distance temple area is beautiful note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud service also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you had my  th birthday while staying the hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits spent two thousand pounds on   rooms felt short changed comfortable room which was very clean my son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms he booked directly with apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that i paid booking via booking com cost me almost an extra   for breakfasts even after i had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison no positive everything was genuinely perfect everything from the reception greeting of luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception the cleaning staff were polite and warm my standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room nothing our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our green band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors very comfortable and clean room balcony was a little plus bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iphone   adapter advertised sky movies but was pin protected but i m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code alex hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a junior suite which was amazing free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh it took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room but that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional the room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything also had to love the apex duck would definately recommend staying in an apex hotel its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except one office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is minimalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there glad i just booked it for one night to try a new place since i am frequently traveling to london and was searching for a place closer to our office in fleetstreet location would have been great the breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at it would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway it caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers the food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this room was a nice size and very quiet quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there we were in room   which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing no negative the hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of london so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit we didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep there was very little traffic noise either it was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards the novello is a about   minutes walk away i loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home the room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean a bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast location of the hotelno negative really lovely and luxurious hotel special thanks to gosia on reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you gosia a couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans the room was really completely sound proof we appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes and if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack the superior rooms are equipped with a bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable room on small side for a king very expensive for the wednesday thursday nights first night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab third night managed to find   soft pillows bed comfortable not enough hangers in cupboards for   people staying more than   night room temperature control did not go lower than  c and seemed to revert to  c once room key taken out bar prices on the high side excellent location good standard of hotel professional service lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled jellybeans and pringles missing only one duck  people automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users didn t get the room i booked no positive the ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but i am aware i m fussy with my baths location was reason for booking and was spot on staff were all very pleasant time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains check out swift and easy no negative location of the hotel is fantastic the hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful the room was massive particularly considering its location in london the breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around london a bit mean with tea coffee milk in room great hotel in good location fairly near theatres st paul s tate modern the city river thames the shard half hour walk to trafalgar square a bit more to soho oxford st nice to walk along the river to westminster or get a boat    min taxi from st pancras fairly quiet district for london but not much happening in the immediate location tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience we got a room   with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony especially in summer you won t have much privacy location temple is very central but still i would chose another central location the next time i m in london as in the weekends temple seems a bit deserted room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need bed was very comfortable as well the surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road   the hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that i can understand but then the plug in the room should be closer to the mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord because i could not see myself in the mirror whilst i was drying my hair so basically the hotel has have   options larger hair dryer electric cord electric plug closer to the mirror mirror on both sides of the tv   another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night i guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced the bed really confortable location is good walking distance to tube and train can t think of anything that could have been improved room was gorgeous and very clean lovely big bed high quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go location and price so close to christmas was awesome room upgrade on arrival was much appreciated after a long and difficult flight staff very welcoming and attentive helped us with our bags and shopping when we checked in and out were on hand to order taxis and help it was also quiet and out of the way despite the central location sorry can t think of any negative thing it is tucked away but near to public transport the staff were friendly efficient and helpful their restaurant had a great selection at reasonable prices beds comfortable very clean and we had a lovely walk in shower how hasn t this place got a extra star it should be five star not four what didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful we loved everything at the apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly the food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room the nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages and the elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch elemis is a amazing brand to use really we could find fault with nothing the location so close to the centre but beautifully quiet the efficiency of the whole operation including breakfast which is often the weak link in hotels the stylish decor within an old style exterior the basin doesn t seem to be clean enough it s difficult to drain waters down the basin location close to city center big ben and river thames   minutes walk to temple station bed is comfortable the shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty the location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite the staff was more than helpful could have had a few more different tea bags in room room and bathroom very clean room quite spaciious for london comfortable king size bed in a quiet square away from the noise of traffic nice to have tea making facilities in room as always the price of breakfast is far too expensive there are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices the location of the hotel is perfect it s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to temple or blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield the superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking there are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa the room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep the staff are very attentive polite and helpful we heard our neighbors bathroom in the night we arived the hotel late in the night and the staff service was exelent without extra charge upgraded our room the ducks idea is unique and fun in the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk i didn t know what happened the air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature the room is spacious and clean amenities are all prepared which is very helpful the staff are very kind hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help clean comfy and a great location for us no negative location was very central but rooms very quiet reception very friendly efficient and helpful bags were taken to rooms discounted breakfast offered in addition to room only we had booked facilities described map of london given and named member of staff provided as contact during our stay over the weekend bar staff and housekeeping staff were equally good excellent personal service our best hotel stay in london for a decade all is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower likewise bedroom was not clean nothing i do not recommend this hotel to tourists the manager does not care about you and they do not try to deal with your problems we didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away very quiet location considering so close to fleet street comfortable bed the rooms and corridors were much to hot however i was able to lower the temperature in the room there is absolutely nothing else to complain about a lovely hotel i liked the green elephant outside the condition of the room after it was cleaned was exceptional the bathroom was stunning having a free bottle of still and sparkling water every day was brilliant there was an ironing board kettle hairdryer safe fridge free wifi i was very comfortable the whole stay it was also very quiet food in the restaurant was   star there wasn t a full length mirror in the room we were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup love elemis toiletries modern bathroom and clean liked that the shower was separate to the bath beds comfy overall very pleased unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for     hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available i did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free room and comfy bed wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok very dark and quiet room perfect for sleep big and nice bathroom i realise that good accommodation is expensive in central london but neverthelessi feel this hotel is somewhat costly we were on a room only rate so i cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel the location is unbeatable both from the point of view of access to all the sites and attractions of central london but also the area where the hotel is located is very attractive the hotel is quite the staff were very friendly facilities in the bedroom and bathroom were first class just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day maybe need to book very early to get a good deal great sized room and bathroom with separate bath very comfortable bed and nice touch of some free jelly beans we didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered service was very slow one hour and a half for   burger   risotto and   pies room was excellent bed very comfy and quiet staff were great especially leandro who was working in the bar on sa i can t think of anything that could have been improved staff were extremely friendly and efficient i mentioned that we were taking the trip to celebrate my husband s birthday so staff arranged for chocolates to be left in the room which was a lovely surprise breakfast really good too all minor issues the location of the room was good however i did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room when we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal there was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time one opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping the location of the hotel is great room and bed were comfortable and clean we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time however we were able to get an early check in with no problems would definitely stay there again the food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available we had to venture out to eat instead stylish hotel in a great location for exploring london rooms very well appointed and comfortable really enjoyed our stay here several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips enjoyed use of club lounge perfect for continental breakfast hotel not too big situation great for visiting many tourist sights would stay again the smart tv wasn t connected to the internet so i couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart tv also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else the bed was extremely comfortably and the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it no negative they were more than accommodating with allowing early check in and complementary late check out would really recommend the apex group of hotels for your business or leisure travels really couldn t fault it a lovely luxury yet highly friendly hotel that will put a big smile on your face as soon as you walk past the elephant we brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated lovely room and access to the club lounge was great no negative great location with easy access to the underground fabulous breakfast with hot foods selections comfy and cozy bed all staff were very welcoming as always room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty my in room breakfast pancakes went so hard i couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot location was great we walked there from victoria and very close to covent garden decor quite lovely beds and pillows very comfy showers spacious baths deep good amount of storage and in room facilities in room breakfast was promptly delivered and beautifully presented was not told about the   extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days this needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive location and staff were excellent arrived early and was aloud to check in with no problems while some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g jesus other staff were just rude to the level that i will not recommend this hotel to any of my network great location very clean and comfortable no negative the busstop at fleetstreet one step away from the hotel furthermore a lot of restaurants and theatres at walking distance the hotel is nice modern clean and quiet we chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and london has so much more to offer when it comes to food pillows were too chunky room was spacious as was the bathroom with lovely complimentary toiletries beds were extremely comfy check in and out was a breeze and staff were attentive great cocktails in the bar all good the room was good size very clean and comfortable good menu at reasonable prices best to get room with club access for a little more money as you will save this on breakfast alone i didn t understand the continental breakfast setup my room didn t include breakfast a weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing   pounds no positive no full length mirror in bedrooms breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking really great reception staff fantastic suzed rooms amazing location great food being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror the bed was really comfortable we had a quiet room with dual aspect windows and a lovely view of the london eye and the shard the bathroom with separate shower and bath tub the helpful attitude of staff room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to   degrees very nice hotel immaculate excellent location good size room would definitely stay again i bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the   service charge they were not happy when i queried it and asked for the money back light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced good sized rooms and well fitted out very helpful concierge and reception desk staff maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them excellent bedding mattress and pillows room large and very quiet in the upper floors as requested staff extremely service minded and helpful wonderful location we took the tube from st pancras int l to temple when arriving however we discovered afterwards that the double decker bus   stops a few meters from the hotel and goes to the strand trafalgar piccadilly oxford circus etc i e ideal for shopping theatres and activities it was also very easy to go back to st pancras walking north on fetter lane to holborn then taking bus   to king s cross next to st pancras int l no negative we were given a complimentary upgrade to the top floor by a very friendly lady who checked us in all the staff we encountered were courteous welcoming i would definitely stay here again also a perfect location in an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a   minute walk away the hotel was luxurious with large comfortable beds and good pillows as it was away from the main tourist areas it was quiet at night so good for sleeping the breakfast was varied and very tasty with the hot breakfast made to order from the menu it was possible to walk into covent garden within     minutes which meant many attractions and restaurants were easily reachable an excellent base for a good week stay with interconnecting rooms for the family we were put in a disabled room so no bath as we were up for a function in middle temple hall location could not have been better very comfortable room and very obliging staffno negative an excellent location for london sights and theatre district the staff were very friendly and accommodating super breakfast and a well stocked bar check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and i will have to have room with two singles disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone ac unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally bose docking station only suitable for iphone   do those still exist there was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat at this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience no positive my room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds great location good size room for london with very friendly and helpful staff the heating was turned to   degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm i left a jacket and suit bag behind and francesco was super helpful in tracking it down great bathroom and good pillows there was no bubble bath over all the satyr was great the staff were most help full bed was comfy bath was hugh took care of my every need and made myself and my partner most welcome room facing a wall this hotel is located on the western edge of the city in the walking distance from all the west end attractions in a quiet courtyard next to the temple inn of court the room was spacious and well equipped i was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description the view offices   meter from my window the price of room service the location the friendly staff the comfort and cleanliness of the room the bathroom the hotel s design the inner court and the lovely bar area need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but i find that problem during most of my stays in hotels the room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner i didn t make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump the bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and i also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon i passed this view on to the chef because i think in england were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often the whole room was nicely decorated nothing the appearance of the hotel was beautiful and every single member of staff was delightful hotel bar was very relaxing and our room size was perfect was difficult to see from afar where hotel is had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place the hotel was lush beds were extremely comfy very clean too staff were great always willing to help in the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all when we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the apex hotels fault may i add advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the apex the concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault the hotel was a   minute walk from blackfriars station beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance on arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade rooms were fantastic with everything you need ideal for our romantic weekend away bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs they had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in london without our case having to come with us also a   minute walk from covent garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t no negative staffs are very kind and friendly i ve stayed at apex before when i checked in a staff told me welcome back i was really happy for such a friendly atmosphere thank you so much room isn t as photo shows in booking we booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size  m  with sofa we were given a room on   floor the room was small abt    m  only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space room is very clean good facilities one staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo id was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day great location comfortable clean room with all facilities we needed staff generally helpful the ac couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down about     of the tv channels didn t work due to weak signal only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms there are other lifts but they re staff only great location the rooms and bathrooms are very well laid out with plenty of storage elemis products shampoo conditioner bath gel and lotion lovely coffee and tea service includes milk chocolate and different types of sugar plenty of outlets clever desk vanity set up is a perfect area to dry hair makeup the bench at the end of the bed is also very handy nothing the hotel is well located and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff they are so helpful and very attentive i cannot speak highly enough of the staff they help to make it a great hotel in london no negative our room was lovely and modern with everything you could need the club lounge was a lovely peaceful space to have breakfast in and then later relax in and have a refreshment after a busy day sightseeing there really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel i couldn t fault this hotel it more than met my expectations in the d cor size of room position and helpfulness of staff regular customer of apex city of london hotel they didn t know i was a returning customer upon arrival breakfast should have been included for over   for a room super comfy bed beautiful courtyard towards the rear the room that i was given is smaller than what was shown when i reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one the room view was to corporate offices so i couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode good location and decent style and atmosphere no negative the hotel is well located in the legal district of london and within walking distance of major city landmarks such as st paul s cathedral theatres and trafalgar square staff were friendly and helpful the room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature reception staff were excellent gym was well equipped for the size the restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free hotel is in a good position although tucked away from the main road our room was very clean and the bed comfortable the iron and ironing board came in handy as we were going to a weddingno negative loved the courtyard nice place to unwind after sightseeing lots of attention to comfort and details in our room towel warmer wash cloths usb ports lovely bedding cute rubber duckie cozy and comfortable public areas no negative wonderful pillows seriously it s been over   years since my last trip to london my impression is that london has become a more friendly city and this extends to all the staff at apex temple who were courteous and helpful to us staff wasn t super friendly doorman was impatient and bordering on rude modern and well appointed nice shower bathrobes slippers in room ironing board and adapters if you forget one no decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room friendly and helpful staff location in easy walking distance of theatres shops and river hotel was quiet although on a busy street seemed very matter of fact at reception lacked warmth didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine beautiful elemis bath products supplied location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep really comfortable rooms nice friendly staff lovely courtyard to have drinks etc oddly i was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile great value excellent location and a good breakfast nothing we loved the style and comfort of our room and of the hotel in general it s location was perfect right in the heart of the city with all its hustle and bustle yet very restful and quiet the staff were excellent and the service superb nothing location was great walking distance to lots of attractions hotel itself was immaculate comfy beds spotless bathroom with elemis toiletries couldn t fault anything it was an excellent hotel all round nothing to complain about the rooms were very comfortable with beautiful modern decor great lighting robes iron drinks and a cracking bed the hotel is set back slightly from fleet st in its own courtyard and it has a modern bar and a well appointed gym the staff were excellent as was the breakfast we had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit have stayed here before and love this hotel for the location it s a min taxi from st pancras close to trafalgar sq somerset house the river tate modern st paul s the oldest pub in london many theatres the rooms are very well appointed and the friendly courteous staff make this a special place to stay there is also a very nice tapas bar next door the noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed the nice rooms tv fast wireless the great bathroom breakfast was chaotic slow and had to keep on asking for missing items definitely the b team on that day was better in previous stay very well appointed hotel with friendly efficient reception staff overall good experience set back off fleet street so no traffic noise the really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening lovely hotel with super clean rooms efficient staff and all that you may need for a comfortable and pleasant stay the room was of a fair size with comfortable bed the only drawback was no possibility of opening the window but this is a minor thing as most people prefer the air conditioning anyway overall a great place booked a room for   and were told it would be a sofa bed didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable no sleep in preparation for a long drive home also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up a bit disappointing after a long day staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck enjoyed it all fabulous bed and bathroom extra big great for getting ready for an occasion it was like a little oasis of quiet set away from all the noise will stay again only   small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks pringles and jelly beans during our   night stay excellent location beds very comfy breakfast good when we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one actually this was not a problem i prefer to have more empty space also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since i am travelling very often to london it will be a problem for me during winter months the hotel is great the staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that i will visit the hotel again the room superior double  th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops very clean good sleep and i liked it aesthetically it has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel i would definitely recommend it none breakfast really gave a good start of the day also the rooms were clean and the beds were super comfy this hotel is stroll recommend for people who d like to stay in a quite and relaxing atmosphere and still be in the heart of everything staff in reception not helpful nore friendly besides we had to wait   minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar poor service compared to the hotel ranking excellent location great bedroom especially the bed nothing to improve wish i could ve stayed longer the room was really large by london standards well planned out great modern decor a balcony to sit outside on nespresso machine elemis toiletries friendly helpful staff very clean good location right on fleet st would stay again we chose this expensive hotel because the photos on booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over london and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal when we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same the restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor the photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food we were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading we were mother and daughter away for a few days in london the room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring nothing the apex temple court hotel is a beautiful facility that is very well located in central london you are a few minutes walk from major destinations the staff is extremely friendly very helpful and very knowldegeable rooms are outstanding and the wifi is goodnall throughout the facility i definitely recommend the stay there for both business and leisure the coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context this hotel offers a great value in a good location the staff was marvelous and helpful to a fault no negative on arrival the receptionist was extremely helpful she gave us a map advised us on the quickest way to get to our destination and as we were leaving she called us a taxi the bar staff were very friendly to overall lovely stay staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception i also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room i spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number once i called reception they said they would called in house service but i still didn t receive the cup perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty p also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance in summary great stay and i would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way rooms were clean and beautiful and loved the bathroom with the free standing bath area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only     mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception very modern comfy rooms very clean lovely staff good wifi ok location good breakfast not included with room price located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants limited view friendly staff willing to help modern rooms and very comfortable close to some old historic pubs frequented by locals rather than tourists can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything the friendly knowledgable staff couldn t do enough for us they made us feel so very welcome the room was excellent from the facilities to the cleanliness and the bed was fantastic very poor front desk service the morning we left we did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport i attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in london we ended up with a taxi that took     hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about   if you re not from london be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on saturday we walked to covent garden for pretty much everything beautiful hotel everything was very clean bed was very comfortable drinks at the bar were great and staff there was pleasant no negative excellent bedroom very large by london standards overlooking the courtyard pleasant staff good location for all the sights you can walk to st pauls and the thames quite easily nice area at night for atmospheric old style fleet street pubs can t find fault with anything loved it everything room with balcony was fantastic very helpful staff central for everything concierge was so helpful when we realised we had left clothing behind it was posted the very next da highly recommend this hotel it s fantastic room was not ready for us to check in the front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal no sense of personal individualised service comfortable bed good location lovely housekeeping staff access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience amazing service great staff the rooms were great and all of my requests were met and exceeded deco is beautiful and location extremely convenient i appreciated the peace and quiet of the location accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in   days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in i had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude spacious rooms housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain the staff very friendly yet professional just a really good hotel and don t forget the duck milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu very comfortable bed quiet room as requested polite and efficient staff as above croissants not flakey enough dining room chairs need tips v noisy when moved bed lovely quietness great all staff v pleasant and helpful two adjacent rooms were requested upon arrival only one was ready comfortable and modern hotel rooms were quiet with large bathroom friendly staff room looked over by office block strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room staff gave us another room without hesitation beds so comfortable and clean staff very helpful location for me but it is still very central hotels in london are always very low quality this one really manages to come in a different higher standard no negative great staff my arrival was very delayed they were waiting and ready for me at  am with an upgraded room ideal location close to covent garden underground etc a bit mean with tea coffee milk etc the only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening very nice hotel in a convenient fairly quiet for london location staff were friendly rooms were a good size comfortable clean nothing the bed and pillows were so comfy i could have taken them home everything was great and especially as it had not been recommended and just picked out of a few looked at on line we were just so pleased and would definitely return bar and food prices but then it is london and the whole city is a rip off close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good although on fleet street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise the bed was probably the best i have ever slept in no negative lovely hotel fantastic location for us excellent customer service at reception i had forgotten to print off concert tickets lovely receptionist went out of her way to help me print them it would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff the very helpful and friendly staff especially cesar in the restaurant and wilfredo always cheerful and ready to help in any way first class facilities and decor you even had good weather for us very considerate please email our invoice thanks the lighting was pretty dark room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp everything was amazing we were very happy and pleased and would definitely go back again also we arrived at    am due to delayed flights all day and the apex staff at the concierge gave us a later check out time entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps as it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps room was well equipped and comfortable decor was modern and attractive location on fleet street near theatreland is good they gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected view on a wracked street corner so i felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price no positive details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out room was quiet and comfortable nice to have ipod speakers nothing could be better everything was excellent beautiful building very friendly staff and the elephant was lovely room was very nice bed so comfortable and big decor very niceno negative everything was perfect and more rooms very good quality fittings beautiful comfortable beds and pillows friendly staff nothing was too much trouble excellent choice of breckfast skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray no opening window bit pricey compared with other similar london stays large comfy bed large walk in shower huge mirror nothing at all the room was lovely extremely spacious and with a balcony the club lounge was a great touch well stocked with food and drinks all the staff were very helpful and keen to make sure everything was to our liking we had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working excellent location beautiful hotel great breakfast no negative we loved everything about staying at apex temple court hotel the staff was nice perfect located the room was big bright and clean bed and pillows very comfortable and furnishing were modern the club lounge was the best we will definitely stay there next time we go to london nothing to complain about here rooms are spacious and a large bathroom with separate full size bath and shower area added to the overall relaxation experience cannot think of anything all the staff to a man woman they were polite and helpful to such an extent that i telephoned the general manager on my return home to congratulate him on the quality of his people the food was good too my self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration on arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this she then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports she then asked how long we have been in the country very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend we have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review regards mr surj dhami no positive the place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort by the end of the trip i found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful the room was ridiculously dark it was a big room but with one small window for that reason alone i would never stay there again the air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference almost every night i was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed the staff did not say hello to me once and i was there for five nights the cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility but it was then suggested to me that i had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue not to be repeated i did not like very much the location was good there was a good shower that is about it no negative room was lovely spacious and luxurious excellent bathroom one of the comfiest beds we ve slept in location is quiet and yet so convenient we walked to drury lane very easily and quickly and it s on a bus route from paddington so we had a leisurely scenic journey back to our train kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry try loch fyne kippers best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard reception staff incredibly attentive helpful and approachable only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in london not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day i had to work i loved the pillows and the bed was super comfortable where can i buy those pillows the new interiors were bar prices but that s london for you i have been stopping here on and off for the past couple of years faultless and extremely pleasant stay within easy reach of all the main tourist hot spots would definitely recommend if on a weekend break no negative very clean rooms nice location entrance is on the main street and the bus station is just  meters away bus no   takes you to picadilly circus and oxford circus very nice lobby good mojito rooms are cozy modern and quiet robes and slippers are included we didn t have breakfast included in our price as we wanted to eat out all the time but the food in the lobby along with our drinks was great can t really think of anything location is great for covent garden and central london very friendly and helpful staff room was extremely clean and comfortable for where it is its great value there was even a charger lead in the room for my fone no negative from arrival staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was excellent our room was first class spacious well appointed and with a good view for   days straight i found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag the room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services location is great close to the city and you can take bus to everywhere as the bus stop is very close to the hotel laundry dry cleaning rates whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high well trained knowledgeable approachable and friendly staff nothing from the moment we arrived and checked in early the staff were great the room was fantastic with a great view of the london eye and big ben sky sports in the room is always a massive plus being an avid golfer the breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for   people for under the cost of   person at the hotel the location was perfect we stayed on a saturday and it was quiet but lovely the rooms were big lovely walk in shower clean no noise from other rooms staff all very friendly and helpful too little wardrobe space no chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers lighting in the bathroom could have been better no where to put toiletries in the shower breakfast was very good with a great choice the bed was so good we didn t want to get up location superb for both the city and the west end staff were very friendly and accommodating absolutely nothing staff always had time for us and when they printed out tickets for the tower of london for us gave us great advice to visit the crown jewels straight away as the queues build up later this proved to be the case expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage great connection to public transport polite service did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities considerate helpful and friendly staff lovely room value for money apex the duck gift in bathroom no negative had amazing service free upgrade and when my husbands flight delay nearly interfered with our trip they allowed an early check for free and tried their best help faultless service no fox news or cnbc on tv these are important channels for us visitors big selection of international channels from other countries wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience great staff love the location there was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast this is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all amazing hotel excellently appointed great location quiet comfortable rooms and very good value for money compared to similar price points black pudding on the breakfast was delicious the breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there we went for my husband s  th birthday the manager kindly arranged for a complimentary birthday card and beautifully wrapped box of chocolates to be left in the room for a fee they sprinkled rose petals from the door to the bed where they put the petals in the shape of a heart there were more around the bath too a lovely extra touch we were given a free upgrade too without even asking the staff couldn t do enough to help they even gave us a second free duck as we said we had two children the room was really clean and modern bed extra comfy shower fantastic the details of elemis toiletries and free jelly beans and pringles were an excellent bonus i cannot fault it and would definitely stay again location is excellent close to blackfriars tube station excellent excellent excellent no negative quiet yet very handy location for a number of london theatres including the savoy although we didn t use the bar it looked very inviting with the option to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine we asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so i called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away   weeks later still nothing at all i think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill the bed was comfy and the bath tube so nice i sleep warm and i couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor large room for london for sure and it s well located in the city the staff was attentive all good room was very comfortable and well appointed attention to detail was obvious customer service in all areas was excellent location was central to city attractions and entertainment there wasn t anything we didn t like the location is amazing rooms are spacious have everything you d need both rooms and public spaces are clean stylish i stayed on a sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week excellent staff high quality room and furnishings and a good breakfast i couldn t fault it at all lovely clean hotel in a great location staff were very friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we had the best possible stay the room was immaculate and well equipped there was nothing to fault the generously sized bathroom had a lovely bath and separate big shower cubicle everything was high quality and the room beautifully appointed very comfortable bed and large not at all noisy considering the location even with the window open plenty of eating places nearby and easy to find on foot no negative absolutely brilliant hotel me and my fiancee booked   nights stay for our anniversary to watch lion king we were upgraded as soon as we arrived great hotel tucked away would   recommend to anyone the only down point i have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high i understand the weekend we visited london was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures the room was refreshed everyday from check in to check out the hotel staff were constantly professional and always helpful nothing seemed too much to ask i found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great everything was amazing the decoration the room the bed the staff we are very happy to have found this hotel and we will recommend it to all of our friends limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening lovely room and good food service and staff excellent breakfast was lovely and waiting time at reception short benefits of a smaller and more intimate hotel nothing everything was spot on i stayed here with my daughter for a bank holiday treat excellent service from all staff and delicious food served in the room after a long day out and about very good location for theatres and covent garden faultless our second visit to this hotel we wouldn t stay anywhere else in london breakfast was very expensive location is good about   mins walk to the tube but also close to st pauls cathedral and the river room was very clean and the bathrooms was very nice am struggling to think of any negatives in fact i cannot think of any at all the room was of excellent quality and the bed was so comfortable i could stay there again for this reason alone wifi being free and of good quality was important for someone like myself roaming with my mobile network staff were extremely friendly and professional i would recommend this hotel to everyone possible bar prices a little steep excellent rooms and it is either a new hotel or recently refurbished we only had the basic room which was very comfortable with a very good en suite great location only   mins walk to trafalgar square lunch was very good but only ate at hotel once staff very helpful and pleasant lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel which was lovely in the spring sunshine you would not have known that it is located in the centre of london good gym as well which i didn t use tube station only   minutes walk away and hotel surrounded by good restaurants and bars breakfast prices might be reduced location fleet street central great staff perfect for sights theatre room facilities gowns coffee iron satellite tv bath and shower comfortable bed quiet when staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the club lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade i thought this was a bit mean spirited also we were awoken at    am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them it was our  th wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room chocolates in the room and a free drink at the bar lovely welcome touch the location is superb none the location was so convenient and it s quite we were upgraded to a lovely clean spacious room with a very comfy bed and pillows the staff were all friendly and professional from the reception raquel and clara concierge wilfredo and restaurant staff especially lina we can highly recommend apex temple hotel the wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain it wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night we paid for an upgrade to our room and liked it very much the bed was comfortable the room well appointed and most of all it was lovely and quiet the hotel was fine though we did little in it except sleep and have breakfast the latter was fine the location of the hotel is convenient for fleet st and neighbouring areas no negative everything you need to make a short break easy a decent hair dryer an iron that gets hot and you don t have to wait an hour for the bath to fill simple things that many london hotels still cannot provide in   cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in and very comfortable almost   star nothing great location check in staff and concierge were so polite and helpful we felt nothing was too much trouble and very genuine the room was spotless and facilities excellent a very quiet room and bed was extremely comfortable which meant we slept very well wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all relaxing ambience quiet location great breakfast excellent service from all of the staff no complaints the whole stay at this hotel was more than perfect location close to the bus station n front of the main entrance in fact and metro     min of walk personnel helpful kind quick reacting to the complaints clean proper rooms in the room there is complimentary cookies tea coffee someone was complaining of not enough of milk i don t think that people should expect a bottle of milk for free in a room it s ridiculous especially if you will mention on a reception or to passing made that you would like to have a little more of mono dose milk they would kindly give it to you wi fi is good bed is large and super comfortable conditioner in the room bath and shower in a bathroom and super cute duck bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper upgraded when we arrived to a lovely spacious room overlooking the square reception staff were plentiful and well informed was approx   minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between temple and black friars stations could just be me being lazy though room was lovely view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms one had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else very clean helpful and polite staff nice rooms generally n a hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all we were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely loved the apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website no negative the superior room was very comfortable the location of the hotel along fleet street was a comfortable walking distance to covent garden if you chose not to walk there are buses just outside the hotel that takes you to there or to trafalgar square over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged this time i was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com i will be coming back every time when i m able to secure such price breakfast is disappointing clean hotel nice quiet location very helpful and supportive staff especially at the reception will be coming back as frequent traveler to london on business purposes provided that price is reasonable no negative nice modern clean decor great location close to tube and taxis many restaurants or coffee places during the week quite dead in the weekend close to theatre area trafalgar square etc absolutely nothing everything fantastic stay at the hotel enjoyed a lovely nights sleep and quiet attention to detail superb i am a coffee fan and was pleased too see the kettle in the room was spotless inside not all full of limescale and quality filter coffee bags on the coffee tray which were really appreciated and coincidentaly my favourite type really impressed with every aspect of this hotel and will definately returnno negative the staff were fantastic we requested an ice bucket and it was at the room almost straight away the gentleman who checked us in remembered my name our bathroom had the most amazing bath and overall we felt we got upgraded booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price conflicting information from the staff very comfortable bed and spacious en suite very enjoyable stay food drink was delicious but a little pricey stunning hotel superb location luxurious rooms waking up to views of the london eye the shard big ben was a really bonus there is absolutely nothing that we didn t like stayed here a year ago and if anything standards are even higher than before friendly efficient staff spacious comfortable well equipped room spotlessly clean in a peaceful central location no negative the room was beautifully furnished and the walk in shower and spacious bathtub was superb the staff were fantastic very helpful and friendly location was very convenient for covent garden s shops bars and restaurants would definitely recommend the breakfast is expensive the size of room large and cosy very comfy bed being able to open the windows great shower fluffy big towels bath sheets coffee facilities in room quiet room no housekeeping knocking on door at  am room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con wifi is not super speed as stated in fact i couldn t log on at all for our two night stay very peaceful and quiet would not believe you were so close to the main roads staff extremely friendly helpful everything was spotless and clean rubber duck is a great gimmick children loved taking him on our travels and taking pictures an extra   charge i m still to work out for what the additonal   wasn t on my receipt at checkout would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the   mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout the view was very good big ben chard houses of parliment complimentary  hr late checkout my one experience in the dining room was not great i ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian quiet location in a courtyard off fleet street spacious room with shower and full bathtub extra comfortable and luxurious bedding friendly staff lively bar near the lobby fifteen minutes walk from three different tube lines fast reliable internet complimentary bottled water replenished each day all night menu could have had better quality choices arrived late and had dinner and drinks at the lively bar lounge area great room with stellar bathroom and toiletries the free coffee and hot cocoa in the room was replenished daily with a few complementary cookies as well fast free wifi loved the stay no negative we stayed at the apex after a conference i had in london last week the staff at the front desk and the lounge were extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very modern very clean and very quiet we had a very comfortable stay and will definitely be looking to return to the apex should our travels take us back to london in the near future would have liked an easter duck to go with our christmas duck parking is quite a distance from the hotel however very good rate would be nice to have the option of valet parking staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble rooms have everything you need very clean and comfortable very quiet love the ducks second stay at this hotel last was at christmas stayed in the same room comfortable walking distance to st paul s south bank and covent garden to name but a few will definitely stay again breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which i prefer but that s the only minimal thing i could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly amazing room had a great bathroom staff were friendly and very helpful room service was amazing and to channels too best hotel i ve stayed in nothing could be improved our stay was excellent the hotel location the room and staff were all excellent the cleanliness and standard of the fixtures and fittings in the room hotel generally was excellent breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful lovely building tucked away nice quiet location but not far from theaters restaurants etc door staff welcoming and friendly there is nothing i would criticise the hotel for it s a really good hotel in the city extremely comfortable and quiet considering the location this was my second time staying and i d have no hesitation returning in future the only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with london we found it quite difficult to find other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better the room was amazing it was very spacious and immaculate upon arrival the staff were very friendly and showed us where to go and advised on optional extras we thoroughly enjoyed our stay no negative staff extremely welcoming friendly room service was extremely quick generally the hotel maintains high standards very pleased with this booking overall will definitely return nothing of note everything was perfect well ok the phone in room   didn t work friendly staff very professional and a great central location room backed into another building and thoroughfare lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed the bed was especially comfy and the room was very quiet great nights sleep elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed lovely hotel very comfortable particularly loved the approach in the evening with the lighting red carpet and lovely elephant breakfast good with plenty of choice for every taste extremely good value we thought all staff were lovely courtyard view splendid the bin men came a little later on a sunday morning but hey we were in central london its noisier in   hotels certainly not the hotels fault comfortable bed with lovely duvets and pillows simply furnished but totally practical very amenable staff   hour bar service would be good but i can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay lovely clean room good shower modern accommodation staff were all very helpful and friendly lovely bar area we were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay it would be nice if it was a bit cheaper staff were friendly our room was ready when we arrived at     pm they changed our room from a double to a twin in room dining was superb food was fab there is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside there has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers everything was great the service the rooms location no negative classy tasteful d cor great location courteous staff and some nice little touches in the rooms that made it feel special nice place for a romantic getaway room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice comfortable spacious room cleanliness overall lovely shower did not take breakfast but expensive bed and bedding and from fittings top quality state of decoration excellent clean paintwork tiling etc in bathroom tranquil obliging checkin and concierge service nothing hi standard of accomdation staff were very attentive and good attention to detail with luxury extras provided only a   min walk to covent garden very near to the royal courts of justice somerset house and the strand too hot everywhere air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at   degrees but it seemed to jump back to   everything breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere the room was spotless was in a very quiet location even though off of fleet street only   mins walk to covent garden theatres very luxurious room with huge king bed enormous pillows beautiful too expensive for me most of the time i love this place the only hotel i have found in this part of london where i am treated as an individual amazing friendly service you feel you could ask what you want and the staff would try and help there was nothing not to like the rooms were excellent the beds were super comfy overall this is a really lovely hotel one i am definitely staying in again no negative the location of the hotel is brilliant for all the main sights of london rooms were spacious and clean bed comfy a taxi was booked for us no problem decent price considering it s central london will definitely book again receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however i would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives bar and bar staff lovely great cocktails room huge for a london hotel and great value facilities brilliant tea and coffee facilities were good but not excellent these places never leave enough milk in the rooms this is the worst thing i can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad everything beautiful building lovely rooms great staff and a fantastic price no negative polite helpful staff immaculate rooms and fantastic location views of houses of parliament and millennium eye from our window would definitely stay there again would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views good standard luxuary hotel with covent garden leicester square thames and theatres in walking distance nothing we loved our stay we got a room upgrade at a very cheap price the facilities were great location central and the staff were helpful and friendly wish we could have stayed longer shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night fantastic hotel with great staff and facilities nothing was too much trouble and the room was exactly as we expected also loved the fact we could take the rubber duck away which also helps promote the hotel very clever marketing i would of loved to of stayed another night or two everything was perfect just what i was looking for the room was magnificent the staff were very friendly and helpful it was a nice relaxing stay the breakfast the next day was delicious really filled us up for the day ahead we had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles we didn t get any and over   for   beers it would have been appreciated clean comfortable room excellent bed and pillows excellent breakfast very quiet in a busy city there was no table and chairs on the balcony and only   plastic chair in the corner of balcony in a double room you d expect there to be   the room was big and spacious and the bed was soooooo comfy beautiful bathroom and shower and breakfast was amazing not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues great location away from busy tourist areas but easy and quick access to west end exmouth market where we went to eat on one night could walk easily to convent garden and soho and lots of buses to points beyond very friendly staff excellent martinis at the bar rooms clean spacious comfortable only a one night stay just a one night stay to see a musical at the aldwych theatre the hotel is ideally situated for theatres numerous london attractions underground stations and the thames the staff were superb we will go again the room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character it felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure it was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities the view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall it made the room very dark however not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable in this instance i was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff beautiful building courtyard was stunning marvellous location just a short walk from temple tubestation along the thames very pretty the staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday they delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special the lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it the design of the space left a long lasting impression the rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee the maid coming into my room on both mornings at   when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy room was clean and tidy with lots of room and a comfortable bed no negative from the moment we walked in to the moment we left we couldn t fault the staff hotel or facilities best hotel we have ever stayed at in london will definitely return room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room the room was lovely staff were brilliant too very helpful offering maps and recommendations breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when i complained not easy to get to by tube great rooms friendly helpful staff no negative nothing to fault with this hotel everything was perfect from start to finish we were also upgraded to a superior room and a surprise birthday cake in the room the staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were immaculate will recommend to everyone and look forward to returning in the summer pillows to soft and room service to keen woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning lovely decor friendly staff good location but it is about a   minute walk to a tube station brilliant facilities large bath and walk in shower the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet when we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on the personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet breakfast was good and worth the money personnel gave us   discount every morning nothing everyone friendly tried hard to acknowledge my mums birthday and upgraded our rooms excellent location and would recommend the hotel to anyone we paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify   it was the only bar part of the break room was amazing and the bed was awesome the executive lounge was a let down and i would not pay the extra to access this facility again the rooms were excellent and the staff were very helpful no negative very nice location within walking distance of all the main attractions and theatres the view from our window was the icing on the cake overlooking the london eye and the houses of parliament the staff were extremely friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble the only thing was that i had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with   candles a   and a   and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel i was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles a bit dissapointed there cause i would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise it was an amazing weekend i had planned a birthday surprise for my partner but the staff at the apex took it further surprising both of us at the end nothing this was our fourth stay here never regret staying here excellent hotel nice rooms great location for westend theatres very helpful and friendly staff quiet and bonus views over london they forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon even then they failed to clear a drinks tray friendly mostly efficient but unobtrusive staff comfortable clean quiet and convenient the club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water great location great friendly and efficient staff i still found the hotel a little on the expensive side also not a big thing but if you re going to have a bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded ipods iphones well located and very comfortable if not remarkable rooms no negative staff were very friendly welcoming was pleasant and all of my needs were met room was spotless very comfortable bed and large bathroom with shower and bath great views from the room and was extremely quiet would recommend high floor for good views of london eye big ben and shard would recommend to anyone and will be returning shortly perfect bathroom too cold and not heated towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted also a little surprised by the club room no snacking possibilities no english beer great bed room design nice the price is steep it is quite luxurious but maybe not   a night luxurious fantastic location phenomenal staff gorgeous room it was a very luxurious stay i almost didn t want to leave the room i walked everywhere the hotel is in the middle of it all no negative the staff at reception were incredibly helpful the room was very comfortable with a great sized bathroom with bath tub this was the first stop in a month long trip and it was a great way to start very central location and within easy walking distance to all attractions we have already recommended the hotel to several people in the uk europe not a single thing the location is excellent midway between the west end and st paul s the hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto fleet st and the hustle and bustle of the city of london staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful no negative the customer service standard of accommodation quality of design and fixtures staff were excellent cannot wait to come back breakfast was excellent selection at breakfast was very good our room   was stunning breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price they also added     service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty great location and lovely breakfast selection lovely clean room with large comfortable bed nice and quiet and amazing shower and bath no negative reception well staffed by cheerful and very helpful team cleaner and better appointed room than much more expensive alternatives will definitely retain as option for future trips to london nothing everything was just right this is an amazing hotel we first went in jan   for a six night break and loved it so much that we went in jan   for five nights the staff are very helpful and there are always plenty around the location is fantastic just a few minutes walk to the strand and about   mins to oxford street the rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the wifi works well and allows multiple devices to be logged on we like this hotel so much that we are now thinking about one of the apex edinburgh hotels for the end of feb no negative excellent clean and comfortable room top quality bedding nice to find a feather pillow front desk staff were excellent everything was efficient without any fuss no negative everyone was very welcoming room was lovely bed was the best and great location after having received a call to make sure we had organised ourselves for christmas day lunch we decided to have christmas lunch at the hotel which was good value very nice touch thank you nothing to report great location for nye celebrations and only a short walk into covent garden etc really nice spacious and well equipped room helpful and friendly staff would happily stay here again there wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the new year s eve dinner menu was available however our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu the view from our room and the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff nothing we didn t want to leave the hotel is in a great location the staff were very friendly helpful and welcoming we loved our visit to the hotel which was our second time there and next time we are in london we will definitely stay here again children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on selected an upgraded room lots of space comfortable and the nespresso machine a nice touchno negative the room and facilities are very nice i really wanna stay in all day but yeah we re here to travel the location is good there s a bus stop right in front of the hotel but you may need to walk at least   minute if you come from any underground station nearby service is really poor in this hotel very expensive for low value services for same price you can find something better in the same location there is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all good location in a nice area of london no negative comfortable small hotel with a lived in atmosphere staff very helpful and all facilities you need especially for a place of this size ideally located for southwold would stay again nothing maybe i would have loved to have a bath tub but the shower is good staffs are very nice and helpful well located with buses in front of the hotel to go to oxford streetno negative perfect location you can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions london eye big ben buckingham palace tower bridge as well as the shopping streets covent garden oxford street hotel itself is very clean nice personal the restaurant bar and roomservice are also good no negative comfort of the room is excellent especiallly the technology sky tv and good quality free wi fi the hotel was quiet within and outside especially if you specify a rear facing room i know this is london and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive extremely comfortable hotel beautiful big rooms and bathroom quiet and friendly the bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks one of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental a poor experience compared to the hilton or other equivalent lounges i wouldn t have minded that much but i purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access food in the restaurant was good and the size of the room was excellent no negative lovely hotel from start to finish very clean comfortable and a good night sleep the staffs can t do enough for you well worth the money cant fault anything     rude reception staff at check in rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for   mins then when we enquirer where our other   rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was greatno positive we were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half   by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until   o clock however being the weekend before christmas i can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be i informed the hotel that we were staying for our anniversary when asking for a good view from the room and we were upgraded to a balcony with a wonderful view of london staff were friendly and even put our bags in the room ready for when we arrived back at the hotel later in the day nothing brilliant location between west end and thames riverside always extra special with a warm reception and courteous staff whether front desk or room service cleaners etc there was a big problem the staff apologized and i was to have received a refund of some money but i never did athe issue was stressful i would not return clean facility the standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better you literally could just walk around the edge of the bed breakfast was very expensive we didn t bother just   minutes walk along the road was pret where the price was a quarter as much the room was very quiet considering we were in central london the hotel is tucked away in a courtyard which is nice very comfortable bed very nice walk in shower the location of the hotel is excellent easy   minute walk to convent garden or st paul s cathedral or embankment to catch a boat along the thames nothing staff were super nothing was too much trouble professional but approachable lovely comfy bed so great night s sleep ready to explore all the places of interest so close to the hotelno negative the room was excellent warm with high quality facilities the toiletries were lovely and luxury fluffy towels we also had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurantno negative the hotel is in a very central location but tucked away quite discreetly so it feels private the room was very comfortable no sound carried over from the rooms or hallways allowing us a decent night of sleep the bathroom was beautifully luxurious and clean we also had a drink in the hotel bar which was very good no negative comfortable beds pillows and comforters big bathroom with deep and nice bathtub and large separate shower luxurious bath products fun bar fri sat nights no negative we liked everything from arrival to departure and all points in between apex temple court excels the hotel the facilities and above all the staff are just fantastic it s not really a bad experience but i did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom there was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so i would request a different room next time comfortable room good breakfast and cooked options included in the price nice bar area too nothing would happily stay in any apex property and now considering a stay in edinburgh reception staff were superb the room we were allocated had a great view of the london eye and oxo building quality hotel nothing flashy or cheap all very modern stylish well run and looked after dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend garfunkels near st pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front really good located close to musical area and st pauls very nice rooms big bathroom helpful staff ok not major moans but far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down restaurant wasn t good just about ok food a little cold and too pricey for what is was very clean hotel to the point of sparkling comfortable standard club room with tea making great location for major sighs but out of the hustle and bustle of the west end hop on the bus hail a cab or walk  mins to get almost anywhere breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a   discount the staff were polite and helpful the room was well appointed and the bed was probably the most comfortable i have slept in it was a good location to get to covent garden and tube stations no negative nothing was too much bother for the staff i was meeting up with my sister and brother in law we had tea drinks etc in the lounge not rushed at all expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value great facilities and the club lounge is well worth the extra price staff very helpful and setting and location is excellent we paid   for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking   mins away why don t they advertise this a van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad the staff were friendly and helpful at breakfast a waitress did not understand what we ordered but it was changed very quickly we couldn t check in with two attempts even at    pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone  pm although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully our room was lovely and the staff were attentive welcoming and very helpful no negative the staff were friendly and helpful we received a complimentary upgrade the room was fab spacious and comfortable the breakfast was really good second stay here would definitely return again no negative the staff made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and we only had to wait  minites for our room to be ready the room was lovely and quiet facing the courtyard the facilities in the room were great and we especially liked the big shower parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away the hotel could do with valet parking services i have stayed at some top hotels in england but i have never stayed in a hotel where there were always   staff on reception there was never a queue to check in out or to have questions answered great all round hotelno negative perfect location clean modern hotel and we was given a complimentary upgrade as it was my boyfriends birthday our room was beautiful and big with lots of lovely little extras that make all the difference staff were very helpful with my request for an early check in thank you can not fault it we d definitely return the walk from the nearest underground it s not really that far but i m pregnant so i struggled a little bit the comfort and cleanliness of the hotel room no negative staff were very friendly and welcoming upon arrival the free room upgrade was excellent the hotel facilities were very good the breakfast menu choice was wide ranging and the food was cooked perfectly the location was so convenient to the inns of court the city of london and to central london i just don t think a room without breakfast is worth   i suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it very confy bed great bar with lovely staff no negative it just felt like a very nice hotel and most important for me was the comfortable clean room the friendly staff big shout out to paul it was nice to be able to relax in the lounge after seeing a show location was very good i did not have breakfast so i cant review michael bathroom smelled soooo bad like a dead rat un the pipes and at  h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while i was still asleep what the hell very good bed and equipment in the room nice people breakfast is quite pricey but lovely second time staying at this lovely hotel staff were once again warm and friendly with nothing too much trouble i travelled with my daughter for her  st birthday and the staff all wished her a happy birthday and left her a lovely personalised note and a box of chocolates i love this hotel and can t recommend it highly enough thank you apex temple court for another wonderful stay breakfast in the morning is not very well organized could wait more than   min before getting your english breakfast great location room is not too small very clean comfortable bed great hotel overall no negative modern very clean and very friendly hotel well located food in the restaurant was excellent staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble readily adapted the menu for the children to suit would definitely recommend and stay here again no negative room a good size and comfortable bathroom lovely public areas bar lounge very nice when we came back after our theatre restaurant visits we ended our evening very pleasantly in the lounge staff very helpful and friendly we found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped minor points only one hook in bathroom we needed more lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard we could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water we had a very nice stay   days quiet location no negative very good location close to city centre and thameslink railway spacious rooms nice bathroom and a lot of extra features the breakfast was also very delicious the staff is friendly and helpful the only drawback no parking but there is a public car park   minutes walk from the hotel in the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking special thanks to the staff for it liked everything very comfortable hotel extremely friendly staff comfortable room breakfast is excellent     minutes walk to trafalgar square no negative lovely location very close to the river and a short walk from temple tube lovely walk through temple courts efficient friendly hotel with a great bar really comfy seating and lovely atmosphere restaurant looked good too but we had cocktails and bar snacks in lounge bar which was excellent if a little pricey room styling is modern but well planned and feels a little luxurious love the bathrooms at apex hotels hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting   mins for their cooked breakfast however hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising staff were very good and friendly hotel is in a great location especially for theatre and covent garden overall great place to stay in londonno negative although it s a busy city centre hotel it felt really peaceful and relaxing throughout the soundproofing in the bedrooms must be excellent because we hardly heard anybody else as in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave a very common fault the room design and furbishment comfy bed and pillows great bathroom only one european style   volt electricity plug however adapter would have been available beautiful spacious rooms with moden design but in a cosy way very fast check in and check out beautiful spot very quiet expensive glass wine but you pay for the location not a problem we like to walk back from the theatre at night maybe for some people it would be few hundred meters past their comfort zone the room was very good and staff very helpful slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis bedrooms and the style of the hotel staff are lovely and the hotel is comfortable easy to find off fleet street and close to major sightsno negative excellent centre base for sight seeing would definitely stay here again worth mentioning if you have a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary while staying perfect   out of   from us very few cons entry from street was how we entered initially not best with luggage rear court entry hard to find was better some cabs knew some did not also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function many pros very pleased here modern clean large room and bath excellent stay helpful staff usually stay west of here but this location turned out to be perfect for this trip no negative i booked this for my parents for their golden wedding anniversary trip to london with another couple all four said how fantastic their stay was they commented in particular about how friendly and helpful the staff were and how impressed they were with their room and the hotel facilities no negative we were a party of ten adults booked for a special friends birthday the staff upgraded the birthday girl s room and had it decorated with balloons and banners that friends had mailed down this made a very special birthday a very memorable weekend staff at the hotel were very obliging and couldn t do enough for us all breakfast is very expensive       even if compared to hotels like the househorse guards where it costs some   for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service it s better to go to balthazar or even a starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get the hotel is clean and well located between both temple and chancery lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them the room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need the bed is more for the very soft kind i personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard staff is efficient and very kind no negative what a superb hotel the room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the london eye as it was my boyfriends  th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy the bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid the location was great we were able to walk to every thing we wanted to see breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate they forgot the orange juice excellent decor in the rooms and we ll equipped they gave my husband a small gift for his special birthday a computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay however the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue large room comfortable bed good wifi and easy access to public transportation the toiletries are also very nice quality room was very quiet the pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own hotel is wonderful great accommodations clean and excellent location near soho convent garden the restaurant and bar are expensive not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the west end and thames are just a short walk away beautifully decorated room which was also immaculately clean the bed was gorgeous to sleep in don t think i ve slept in much better the grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on sat sun and monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower more amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on an excellent hotel with a great location apart from a tap malfunction in the main bathroom everything was great a special mention to the concierge who managed to secure us tickets for the theatre at very short notice the master suite was very roomy and very tasteful i would not hesitate to stay here when i am next again in london only minor thing was room wasn t ready   hours after we could have checked in we then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited   hours it would have time from check in to room ready the staff were friendly the room didn t want for anything the ensuite was large and modern breakfast was fabulous the only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out the staff as incredibly helpful and attentive and the concierge is able to book tickets to attractions for us which made the whole process so easy we had a package for free breakfast our first night and the breakfast was amazing the location of this hotel is incredible it s located on a small side street that is very quiet but off of the main road in london fleet st couldn t have imagined a better place to stay in london menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to gafunkals cafe   min walk was a great alternative great location for all major landmarks so much so we walked to most from westminster to tower bridge staff very attentive responsive free upgrade on arrival enjoyed the whole experience so much we added another day to our visit highly recommended nothing we loved the fact that our room had a balcony have stayed in many hotels in london before and never had this luxury at what was a sensible price the only tiny issue i have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service the staff as well as the location and the tabouli rooms make this an ideal hotel for myself and partner to stay at every month when we are in london no milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had can t fault it second time we have stayed here and will undoubtedly stay again nothing great hotel quiet room for a great night sleep as room overlooked a quiet courtyard so no road noise newish hotel so everything felt fresh and up to date great to have sky sports in room have stayed in many london hotels and would rate this as one of the best night stays i wish we could have stayed longer the room was incredibly luxurious and clean the staff were friendly and attentive the location was brilliant a perfect hotel nothing very comfortable room excellent amenities peaceful to step away from london crowds be greeted by the green elephant staff were always welcoming nothing the staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome the room was fantastic big bed and superb bathroom i could not fault anything will definetly stay again next time am in london ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu lovely hotel with nice furnishings and a courtyard for sitting out in the evenings good breakfast too nothing courtyard out the back which takes you away from the main streets lovely place to sit for drinks staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were lovely expensive restaurant lacked any character location is superb for visiting the city contemporary hotel design was good breakfast was good we had a very good meal in the eveningno negative as per the review title this is an oasis in london the calm and quiet starts just yards from the strand very friendly and helpful staff might seem expensive but you get what you pay for no negative had a really nice stay at this hotel received very good service and lovely rooms breakfast and room service food was very nice great location with only a   minute walk in to convent garden breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time the room was big spacious and the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom was similarly huge and had a great standalone bath as well as waterfall showerno negative location of this hotel was perfect most of the sights that i wanted to visit can be visited on foot the room was comfort somerset house was in    mit on foot staffs were friendly the room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far good sized rooms staff friendly and very helpful breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy a few items were unavailable on sunday due to shortages the breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable we were visiting london to celebrate our  th wedding anniversary and the complementary upgrade to a deluxe room was the icing on the cake thank you apex x nothing not to like second time we have stayed here excellent service we arrived at     am and we were still allowed to check in staff very helpful and polite we love the apex hotelno negative the room was really spacious and light and the bed super comfy the rubber duck in the bathroom was a bonus and loved having sky movies no negative excellent location a lovely outside terrace where you could sit and have a drink or eat breakfast in the sunshine would definitely come back having to pay another   each if we wanted breakfast breakfast extra which when the hotel is   per night is very poor not enough tea bags in the room the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom products were of good quality no negative well presented room pleasant staff and good public areas enjoyed sitting outside for coffee good location as we needed to be near covent garden food and drink are overpriced great location and a lovely room huge bath and walk in shower a huge hd television with full sky package pillows were big but somewhat solid hard the pancakes at room service breakfast were hard around the edges great size room for money no negative a haven of peace in hectic london a great hotel which i have visited twice now and which i have promoted to my standard london hotel no negative the room was absoulty amazing clean comfortable felt very welcomed and the front look of the hotel with the elephant was spactauclar to say something the wardrobe in our room was very small everything was ok the place was very clean comfortable and the location very convenient breakfast was not included in the price celebrating a special birthday they give a free upgrade to a suite and a bottle of bubbly nothing the bar food the room upgrade was a wonderful bonus this was our second visit and we will be making a third next yearno negative the size of the bathroom and bedroom not cramped in any way with lovely touches such as bose docking station and samsung flat screen tvno negative they call themselves a hidden gem in london and that s very true it was my first visit here and it will not be my last no negative we liked the style the staff the   access lounge the location which is good for taxis and buses or just walking to the thames breakfast was a bit hit and miss and expensive the quiet location is unusual for london able to sleep with the window open they did a mistake but thier attitude was not enough to me and around hotel there are few resturant open until night good none great location rooms fantastic and they upgraded me to a suite it was huge when i an going to london i am always stay here staff were difficult to locate when wanting to order drinks etc in bar on multiple occasions great location early check in beautiful roomsno negative everything excellent hotel year in year out it is our fourth time there in four years the quality is constantly top the room was smaller than expected so seemed expensive for what it was the location was great and staff very helpful and friendly no negative everyone was helpful and made you feel really relaxed the hotel rooms are very well equipped with everything you could asked for no negative all top nice practical room very clean very friendly and helpful staff and perfect location walking distance to lots of bars and restaurant the bar pricing and the breakfast pricing seemed a little steep even for central london the design and ambience of the hotel was great early check in is not possible approx   hours early only one chair in double room in a such luxurious hotel great location clean room comfy bed ordered full english breakfast to room but came with no toast or bread on side wasnt asked at time of order location and decor comfy bed']"
